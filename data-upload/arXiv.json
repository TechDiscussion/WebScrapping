    "abstract": "Aims. Our goals are to compare the CS, N2H+ and dust distributions in a\nrepresentative sample of high-mass star forming dense cores and to determine\nthe physical and chemical properties of these cores. Methods. We compare the\nresults of CS(5-4) and 1.2 mm continuum mapping of twelve dense cores from the\nsouthern hemisphere presented in this work, in combination with our previous\nN2H+(1-0) and CS(2-1) data. We use numerical modeling of molecular excitation\nto estimate physical parameters of the cores. Results. Most of the maps have\nseveral emission peaks (clumps). We derive basic physical parameters of the\nclumps and estimate CS and N2H+ abundances. Masses calculated from LVG\ndensities are higher than CS virial masses and masses derived from continuum\ndata, implying small-scale clumpiness of the cores. For most of the objects,\nthe CS and continuum peaks are close to the IRAS point source positions. The\nCS(5-4) intensities correlate with continuum fluxes per beam in all cases, but\nonly in five cases with the N2H+(1-0) intensities. The study of spatial\nvariations of molecular integrated intensity ratios to continuum fluxes reveals\nthat I(N2H+)/F{1.2} ratios drop towards the CS peaks for most of the sources,\nwhich can be due to a N2H+ abundance decrease. For CS(5-4), the I(CS)/F{1.2}\nratios show no clear trends with distance from the CS peaks, while for CS(2-1)\nsuch ratios drop towards these peaks. Possible explanations of these results\nare considered. The analysis of normalized velocity differences between CS and\nN2H+ lines has not revealed indications of systematic motions towards CS peaks.",

    "title": "Efficient algorithms for robust recovery of images from compressed data",
    "abstract": "Compressed sensing (CS) is an important theory for sub-Nyquist sampling and\nrecovery of compressible data. Recently, it has been extended by Pham and\nVenkatesh to cope with the case where corruption to the CS data is modeled as\nimpulsive noise. The new formulation, termed as robust CS, combines robust\nstatistics and CS into a single framework to suppress outliers in the CS\nrecovery. To solve the newly formulated robust CS problem, Pham and Venkatesh\nsuggested a scheme that iteratively solves a number of CS problems, the\nsolutions from which converge to the true robust compressed sensing solution.\nHowever, this scheme is rather inefficient as it has to use existing CS solvers\nas a proxy. To overcome limitation with the original robust CS algorithm, we\npropose to solve the robust CS problem directly in this paper and drive more\ncomputationally efficient algorithms by following latest advances in\nlarge-scale convex optimization for non-smooth regularization. Furthermore, we\nalso extend the robust CS formulation to various settings, including additional\naffine constraints, $\\ell_1$-norm loss function, mixed-norm regularization, and\nmulti-tasking, so as to further improve robust CS. We also derive simple but\neffective algorithms to solve these extensions. We demonstrate that the new\nalgorithms provide much better computational advantage over the original robust\nCS formulation, and effectively solve more sophisticated extensions where the\noriginal methods simply cannot. We demonstrate the usefulness of the extensions\non several CS imaging tasks.",

RCP changes\nwith the vertical distribution of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs within the ground.\nInferring this distribution enables the selection of appropriate count rate to\nactivity concentration conversion coefficients. Here PHITS was used to simulate\nthe dependency of RCP on different vertical distributions of $^{134}$Cs and\n$^{137}$Cs within the ground. A model was created of a LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector\nused in drone helicopter aerial surveys in Fukushima Prefecture. The model was\nverified by comparing simulated gamma ray spectra to measurements from test\nsources. Simulations were performed for the infinite half-space geometry to\ncalculate the dependency of RCP on the mass depth distribution (exponential or\nuniform) of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs within the ground, and on the altitude of\nthe detector above the ground. The calculations suggest that the sensitivity of\nthe Compton-to-peak method is greatest for the initial period following nuclear\nfallout when $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs are located close to the ground surface,\nand for aerial surveys conducted at low altitudes. This is because the relative\ndifferences calculated between RCP with respect to changes in the mass depth\ndistribution were largest for these two cases. Data on the measurement height\nabove and on the $^{134}$Cs to $^{137}$Cs activity ratio is necessary for\napplying the Compton-to-peak method to determine the distribution and\nradioactivity concentration of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs within the ground.",

The velocity shifts of the CS(3-2) and (2-1)\nlines with respect to N2H+ correlate well with each other and have similar\ndistributions.

Fits of the spectra to a 2-layer\nradiative transfer model in ten infall candidates suggest that the median\neffective line-of-sight speed of the inward-moving gas is ~0.07 km/s for CS\n(3-2) and ~0.04 km/s for CS(2-1). Considering that the optical depth obtained\nfrom the fits is usually smaller in CS(3-2) than in (2-1) line, this may imply\nthat CS(3-2) usually traces inner denser gas in higher inward motions than\nCS(2-1).

    "abstract": "This paper presents a tutorial for CS applications in communications\nnetworks. The Shannon's sampling theorem states that to recover a signal, the\nsampling rate must be as least the Nyquist rate. Compressed sensing (CS) is\nbased on the surprising fact that to recover a signal that is sparse in certain\nrepresentations, one can sample at the rate far below the Nyquist rate. Since\nits inception in 2006, CS attracted much interest in the research community and\nfound wide-ranging applications from astronomy, biology, communications, image\nand video processing, medicine, to radar. CS also found successful applications\nin communications networks. CS was applied in the detection and estimation of\nwireless signals, source coding, multi-access channels, data collection in\nsensor networks, and network monitoring, etc. In many cases, CS was shown to\nbring performance gains on the order of 10X. We believe this is just the\nbeginning of CS applications in communications networks, and the future will\nsee even more fruitful applications of CS in our field.",

Instead of reconstructing individual blocks, the whole\nimage is reconstructed from the linear convolutional measurements.\nSpecifically, the convolutional CS is implemented based on a convolutional\nneural network (CNN), which performs both the convolutional CS and nonlinear\nreconstruction. Through end-to-end training, the sensing filters and the\nreconstruction network can be jointly optimized. To facilitate the design of\nthe CS reconstruction network, a novel two-branch CNN inspired from a\nsparsity-based CS reconstruction model is developed.

The traditional CS with linear\nmeasurements achieves efficient recovery performances, but it suffers from the\nlarge bit consumption due to the huge storage occupied by those measurements.\nThen, the one-bit CS with binary measurements is proposed and saves the bit\nbudget, but it is infeasible when the energy information of signals is not\navailable as a prior knowledge. Subsequently, the hybrid CS which combines the\ntraditional CS and one-bit CS appears, striking a balance between the pros and\ncons of both types of CS. Considering the fact that the one-bit CS is optimal\nfor the direction estimation of signals under noise with a fixed bit budget and\nthat the traditional CS is able to provide residue information and estimated\nsignals, we focus on the design of greedy algorithms, which consist of the main\nsteps of support detection and recovered signal update, for the hybrid CS in\nthis paper.

We derive a theoretical lower-bound on the MSE performance,\nand propose a practical encoder-decoder design through an iterative algorithm.\nThe resulting coding scheme is referred to as channel- optimized VQ for CS,\ncoined COVQ-CS. In order to address the encoding complexity issue of the\nCOVQ-CS, we propose to use a structured quantizer, namely low complexity\nmulti-stage VQ (MSVQ). We derive new encoding and decoding conditions for the\nMSVQ, and then propose a practical encoder-decoder design algorithm referred to\nas channel-optimized MSVQ for CS, coined COMSVQ-CS. Through simulation studies,\nwe compare the proposed schemes vis-a-vis relevant quantizers.",

A series of\nCsF$_n$ ($n$ $\\geq$ 1) compounds are predicted to be stable already at ambient\npressure. Under pressure, 5$p$ electrons in Cs atoms become active, with\ngrowing tendency to form Cs$^{3+}$ and Cs$^{5+}$ valence states at\nfluorine-rich conditions. Although Cs$^{2+}$ and Cs$^{4+}$ are not\nenergetically favoured, the interplay between two mechanisms (polyfluoride\nanions and polyvalent Cs cations) allows CsF$_2$ and CsF$_4$ compounds to be\nstable under pressure.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method for CS detection aiming to remedy this\nshortcoming by using the language posteriors which are the sum of the\nframe-level posteriors of phones belonging to the same language. The CS\nASR-generated language posteriors contain more complete language-specific\ninformation on frame level compared to the time alignment of the ASR output.\nHence, it is expected to yield more accurate and robust CS detection. The CS\ndetection experiments demonstrate that the proposed language posterior-based\napproach provides higher detection accuracy than the baseline system in terms\nof equal error rate.

    "title": "What's the worth of having a single CS teacher program aimed at teachers\n  with heterogeneous profiles?",
    "abstract": "There is consensus regarding the relevance of including Computer Science (CS)\nin official school curricula. However, this discipline cannot be taught on a\nlarge scale until there are enough trained teachers who can effectively lead a\nclass. In this article, we discuss the results of a 400-hour teacher training\nprogram conducted in Argentina aimed at K-12 teachers with no CS background.\nThe only requirement to sign up was to be an in-service teacher, and therefore\nthere were a plethora of different teacher profiles that attended the courses.\nOur research aims at understanding whether a single teacher training program\ncan be effective in teaching CS contents and specific pedagogy to teachers with\nvery heterogeneous profiles. Also, we investigate what teachers expect to do\nwith the contents they learn. To assess these questions anonymous examinations\nand questionnaires were given and interviews were conducted with course\nattendees. Even though the majority reached the expected minimum bar regarding\nCS contents and pedagogy, significant differences appear in their\nself-perception as regards career opportunities in CS teaching. Our conclusion\nis that carrying out CS teacher training for a broad spectrum of profiles may\nbe effective for promoting CS contents. However, if the goal is to boost\nteachers' confidence in teaching a CS subject, then having a program which\nfocuses on a more restricted selection of profiles would be a better strategy.",

    "abstract": "We report the production of quantum degenerate Bose-Bose mixtures of Cs and\nYb with both attractive (Cs + $^{174}$Yb) and repulsive (Cs + $^{170}$Yb)\ninterspecies interactions. Dual-species evaporation is performed in a\nbichromatic optical dipole trap that combines light at 1070 nm and 532 nm to\nenable control of the relative trap depths for Cs and Yb. Maintaining a trap\nwhich is shallower for Yb throughout the evaporation leads to highly efficient\nsympathetic cooling of Cs for both isotopic combinations at magnetic fields\nclose to the Efimov minimum in the Cs three-body recombination rate at around\n22 G. For Cs + $^{174}$Yb, we produce quantum mixtures with typical atom\nnumbers of $N_\\mathrm{Yb} \\sim 5 \\times 10^4$ and $N_\\mathrm{Cs} \\sim 5 \\times\n10^3$.

But the electromagnetic energy remains\nunchanged everywhere. Based on the de-centered monopole solution generated by\nsymmetry in flat spacetime, we construct two generalized split monopole\nconfigurations, in which the field lines intersect with the CS at arbitrary\nangles. One configuration resembles the outer geometry of the so-called ``new\npulsar magnetosphere model\", for which up to $47\\%$ of the spin down energy is\ntransferred to the Joule heating process in the CS. In the other configuration,\nwe observe that negative energy is dissipated in the CS, which is usually\nobserved in magnetospheres on rotating black holes. This means that energy is\nextracted simultaneously from the central star and the CS to power the output\nPoynting flux at infinity. We interpret the extraction of energy from the CS as\nthat thermal energy of charged particles in the CS is transferred to the\nordered kinetic energy of these particles drifting in the force-free (FF)\nelectromagnetic fields. Hence, the CS is like an ``air conditioner\" in the sky,\nwhich can heat up or cool down, depending on the configurations.",

We also discuss two examples of G\\\"{o}del type metrics in CS modified\ngravity by uplifting to four dimensions a general one-parameter family of\nG\\\"{o}del type solutions of three-dimensional gravity. The first example is the\nusual G\\\"{o}del solution of general relativity which also survives in CS\nmodified gravity with the CS scalar field depending on two variables, the\nradial and the azimuthal coordinates.

We have improved the\ndetermination accuracy of magnetic fields up to the 7 sigma level in the two\nHerbig Ae stars HD139614 and HD144432, observed in 2005 when these objects were\nat a low level state of their CS activity.

The presence of CS polarisation signatures formed in the stellar\nwind supports the assumption that the magnetic centrifuge is a principal\nmechanism of wind acceleration. We conclude that the most effective way to\ninvestigate the magnetism of Herbig Ae stars is to monitor their\nspectropolarimetric behaviour at different states of CS activity.

The\nBasP allows interpretation as a channel-coding problem, and it guarantees\nerror-free reconstruction with a properly chosen measurement matrix and\nsufficiently sparse error vectors. In this manuscript, we examine how the BasP\nperforms on a given measurement matrix and develop an algorithm to discover the\nsparsest vectors for which the BasP fails. The resulting algorithm is a\ngeneralization of our previous results on finding the most probable\nerror-patterns degrading performance of a finite size Low-Density Parity-Check\n(LDPC) code in the error-floor regime. The BasP fails when its output is\ndifferent from the actual error-pattern.

Due to this fact, one has to construct\ntwo different kinds of CS/SS, which correspond to such trajectories in the\nsemiclassical limit. Following this idea, we construct CS in two steps, first\nthe instantaneous CS (ICS) and the time dependent CS/SS as an evolution of the\nICS. The construction is realized for nonrelativistic and relativistic spinning\nparticles both in (2+1)- and (3+1)- dimensions and gives a non-trivial example\nof SS/CS for systems with a nonquadratic Hamiltonian. It is stressed that CS\ndepending on their parameters (quantum numbers) describe both pure quantum and\nsemiclassical states.

    "abstract": "Accurately detecting pedestrians in images plays a critically important role\nin many computer vision applications. Extraction of effective features is the\nkey to this task. Promising features should be discriminative, robust to\nvarious variations and easy to compute. In this work, we present novel\nfeatures, termed dense center-symmetric local binary patterns (CS-LBP) and\npyramid center-symmetric local binary/ternary patterns (CS-LBP/LTP), for\npedestrian detection. The standard LBP proposed by Ojala et al. \\cite{c4}\nmainly captures the texture information. The proposed CS-LBP feature, in\ncontrast, captures the gradient information and some texture information.\nMoreover, the proposed dense CS-LBP and the pyramid CS-LBP/LTP are easy to\nimplement and computationally efficient, which is desirable for real-time\napplications. Experiments on the INRIA pedestrian dataset show that the dense\nCS-LBP feature with linear supporct vector machines (SVMs) is comparable with\nthe histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature with linear SVMs, and the\npyramid CS-LBP/LTP features outperform both HOG features with linear SVMs and\nthe start-of-the-art pyramid HOG (PHOG) feature with the histogram intersection\nkernel SVMs. We also demonstrate that the combination of our pyramid CS-LBP\nfeature and the PHOG feature could significantly improve the detection\nperformance-producing state-of-the-art accuracy on the INRIA pedestrian\ndataset.",

    "title": "Cost Minimization of Charging Stations with Photovoltaics: An Approach\n  with EV Classification",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel electric vehicle (EV) classification scheme for a\nphotovoltaic (PV) powered EV charging station (CS) that reduces the effect of\nintermittency of electricity supply as well as reducing the cost of energy\ntrading of the CS. Since not all EV drivers would like to be environmentally\nfriendly, all vehicles in the CS are divided into three categories: 1) premium,\n2) conservative, and 3) green, according to their charging behavior. Premium\nand conservative EVs are considered to be interested only in charging their\nbatteries, with noticeably higher rate of charging for premium EVs. Green\nvehicles are more environmentally friendly, and thus assist the CS to reduce\nits cost of energy trading by allowing the CS to use their batteries as\ndistributed storage. A different charging scheme is proposed for each type of\nEV, which is adopted by the CS to encourage more EVs to be green. A basic mixed\ninteger programming (MIP) technique is used to facilitate the proposed\nclassification scheme. It is shown that the uncertainty in PV generation can be\neffectively compensated, along with minimization of total cost of energy\ntrading to the CS, by consolidating more green EVs. Real solar and pricing data\nare used for performance analysis of the system. It is demonstrated that the\ntotal cost to the CS reduces considerably as the percentage of green vehicles\nincreases, and also that the contributions of green EVs in winter are greater\nthan those in summer.",

Since single spherical supervoids cannot account\nfor the full profile, the ISW+RS of multiple line-of-sight voids is studied\nhere to mimic the structure of the cosmic web. Two structure configurations are\nconsidered. The first, through simulations of 20 voids, produces a central mean\ntemperature of ~-50 mu K. In this model the central CS temperature lies at ~ 2\nsigma but fails to explain the CS hot ring. An alternative multi-void model\n(using more pronounced compensated voids) produces much smaller temperature\nprofiles, but contains a prominent hot ring. Arrangements containing closely\nplaced voids at low redshift are found to be particularly well suited to\nproduce CS-like profiles. We then measure the significance of the CS if CS-like\nprofiles (which are fitted to the ISW+RS of multi-void scenarios) are removed.\nThe CS tension with the LCDM model can be reduced dramatically for an array of\ntemperature profiles smaller than the CS itself.",

    "abstract": "In an X-ray reflection spectrum, a tail-like spectral feature generated via\nCompton down-scattering, known as a Compton shoulder (CS), appears at the\nlow-energy side of the iron K$\\alpha$ line. Despite its great diagnostic\npotential, its use as a spectral probe of the reflector has been seriously\nlimited due to observational difficulties and modelling complexities. We\nrevisit the basic nature of the CS by systematic investigation into its\ndependence on spatial and temporal parameters. The calculations are performed\nby Monte-Carlo simulations for sphere and slab geometries. The dependence is\nobtained in a two-dimensional space of column density and metal abundance,\ndemonstrating that the CS solves parameter degeneration between them which was\nseen in conventional spectral analysis using photoelectric absorption and\nfluorescence lines. Unlike the iron line, the CS does not suffer from any\nobservational dependence on the spectral hardness. The CS profile is highly\ndependent on the inclination angle of the slab geometry unless the slab is\nCompton-thick, and the time evolution of the CS is shown to be useful to\nconstrain temporal information on the source if the intrinsic radiation is\nvariable. We also discuss how atomic binding of the scattering electrons in\ncold matter blurs the CS profile, finding that the effect is practically\nsimilar to thermal broadening in a plasma with a moderate temperature of\n$\\sim$5 eV.

    "abstract": "As a fundamental magnetic structure in the solar corona, electric current\nsheets (CSs) can form either prior to or during solar flare, and they are\nessential for magnetic energy dissipation in the solar corona by enabling\nmagnetic reconnection. However static reconstruction of CS is rare, possibly\ndue to limitation inherent in available coronal field extrapolation codes. Here\nwe present the reconstruction of a large-scale pre-flare CS in solar active\nregion 11967 using an MHD-relaxation model constrained by SDO/HMI vector\nmagnetogram. The CS is found to be associated with a set of peculiar homologous\nflares that exhibit unique X-shaped ribbons and loops occurring in a\nquadrupolar magnetic configuration. This is evidenced by that the field lines\ntraced from the CS to the photosphere form an X shape which nearly precisely\nreproduces the shape of the observed flare ribbons, suggesting that the flare\nis a product of the dissipation of the CS through reconnection. The CS forms in\na hyperbolic flux tube, which is an intersection of two quasi-separatrix\nlayers. The recurrence of the X-shaped flares might be attributed to the\nrepetitive formation and dissipation of the CS, as driven by the photospheric\nfootpoint motions. These results demonstrate the power of data-constrained MHD\nmodel in reproducing CS in the corona as well as providing insight into the\nmagnetic mechanism of solar flares.",

The optical\npropagation of the CS is modeled through a mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation\n(LLE) coupled with an ordinary differential equation accounting for the\ngeneration of free carriers owing to TPA. The CS experiences several\nperturbations (like intrapulse Raman scattering (IRS), TPA, free-carrier\nabsorption (FCA), free-carrier dispersion (FCD), etc.) during its round-trip\nevolution inside the cavity. We develop a full variational analysis based on a\nRitz optimization principle which is useful in deriving simple analytical\nexpressions describing the dynamics of individual pulse parameters of the CS\nunder perturbation. TPA and FCA limit the efficient comb generation and modify\nthe stability condition of the CS.

We perform detailed\nmodulation-instability analysis and obtain stability condition against\nperturbations of steady-state solution of LLE.

Secondly, a small amount of\nmanually annotated CS data are used to fine-tune the first module. Thirdly, we\npresent a module, which combines Bi-LSTM and self-attention networks to further\nlearn sequential features with temporal and contextual information. Besides, to\nenlarge the volume and the diversity of the current limited CS datasets, we\nbuild a new British English dataset containing 5 native CS speakers. Evaluation\nresults on both French and British English datasets show that our model\nachieves over 90% accuracy in hand shape recognition. Significant improvements\nof 8.75% (for French) and 10.09% (for British English) are achieved in CS\nphoneme recognition correctness compared with the state-of-the-art.",

We examine two possibilities for the CS vector to be\ntime-like or space-like, under the assumption that it originates from v.e.v. of\nsome pseudoscalar matter. It is shown that: a) a time-like CS vector makes the\nvacuum unstable under pairs creation of tachyonic photon modes with the finite\nvacuum decay rate, i.e. it is unlikely realized at macroscopic time scales; b)\non the contrary, the space-like CS vector does not yield any tachyonic modes\nand, moreover, if its dynamical counterpart is substantially described by a\nscale invariant interaction, then the QED radiation effects induce the\ndynamical breaking of Lorentz symmetry, i.e. the occurrence of space-like CS\nvector appears to be rather natural.",

The\nnear-infrared emission is offset from the dust peak suggesting a shift in the\nlocation of star formation over the history of the core.

Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar\nmedium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS,\nH$_2$CS and SO have been detected so far. Aims. We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas.",

Methods: We surveyed a\nsample of 25 carbon-rich AGB stars in the $\\lambda$ 2 mm band, using the IRAM\n30 m telescope. We performed excitation and radiative transfer calculations\nbased on the LVG method to model the observed lines of the molecules and to\nderive their fractional abundances in the observed CSEs. Results: We detected\nCS in all 25 CSEs, SiO in 24 of them, and SiS in 17 sources. We found that CS\nand SiS have similar abundances in carbon star envelopes, while SiO is present\nwith a lower abundance. We also found a strong correlation in which the denser\nthe envelope, the less abundant are CS and SiO. The trend is however only\ntentatively seen for SiS in the range of high mass loss rates. Furthermore, we\nfound a relation in which the integrated flux of the MgS dust feature at 30 um\nincreases as the fractional abundance of CS decreases. Conclusions: The decline\nin the fractional abundance of CS with increasing density could be due to\ngas-phase chemistry in the inner envelope or to adsorption onto dust grains.\nThe latter possibility is favored by a correlation between the CS fractional\nabundance and the 30 um feature, which suggests that CS is efficiently\nincorporated onto MgS dust around C-rich AGB stars. In the case of SiO, the\nobserved abundance depletion with increasing density is most likely caused by\nan efficient incorporation onto dust grains. We conclude that CS, SiO (very\nlikely), and SiS (tentatively) are good candidates to act as gas-phase\nprecursors of dust in C-rich AGB envelopes.",

    "title": "Non-Uniform Time-Step Deep Q-Network for Carrier-Sense Multiple Access\n  in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates a new class of carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA)\nprotocols that employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, referred to\nas carrier-sense deep-reinforcement learning multiple access (CS-DLMA). The\ngoal of CS-DLMA is to enable efficient and equitable spectrum sharing among a\ngroup of co-located heterogeneous wireless networks. Existing CSMA protocols,\nsuch as the medium access control (MAC) of WiFi, are designed for a homogeneous\nnetwork in which all nodes adopt the same protocol. Such protocols suffer from\nsevere performance degradation in a heterogeneous environment where there are\nnodes adopting other MAC protocols. CS-DLMA aims to circumvent this problem by\nmaking use of DRL. In particular, this paper adopts alpha-fairness as the\ngeneral objective of CS-DLMA. With alpha-fairness, CS-DLMA can achieve a range\nof different objectives when coexisting with other MACs by changing the value\nof alpha. A salient feature of CS-DLMA is that it can achieve these objectives\nwithout knowing the coexisting MACs through a learning process based on DRL.\nThe underpinning DRL technique in CS-DLMA is deep Q-network (DQN). However, the\nconventional DQN algorithms are not suitable for CS-DLMA due to their uniform\ntime-step assumption. In CSMA protocols, time steps are non-uniform in that the\ntime duration required for carrier sensing is smaller than the duration of data\ntransmission. This paper introduces a non-uniform time-step formulation of DQN\nto address this issue. Our simulation results show that CS-DLMA can achieve the\ngeneral alpha-fairness objective when coexisting with TDMA, ALOHA, and WiFi\nprotocols by adjusting its own transmission strategy. Interestingly, we also\nfind that CS-DLMA is more Pareto efficient than other CSMA protocols when\ncoexisting with WiFi.",

We mapped five\nprestellar cores, L1544, L1552, L1689B, L694-2, and L1197 using two molecular\nlines, C$^{34}$S $(J=2-1)$ and N$_2$H$^+$ $(J=1-0)$ with the NRO 45-m\ntelescope, doubling the number of cores where the CS depletion was probed using\nC$^{34}$S. In most of our targets, the distribution of C$^{34}$S emission shows\nfeatures that suggest that the CS molecule is generally depleted in the center\nof the prestellar cores. The radial profile of the CS abundance with respect to\nH$_2$ directly measured from the CS emission and the Herschel dust emission\nindicates that the CS molecule is depleted by a factor of $\\sim$3 toward the\ncentral regions of the cores with respect to their outer regions.

We first verify that CS modified gravity\nleads to a theory with torsion, where this tensor is given by an antisymmetric\nproduct of the Riemann tensor and derivatives of the CS coupling. We then\ncalculate the torsion in the far field of a weakly gravitating source within\nthe parameterized post-Newtonian formalism, and specialize the result to Earth.\nWe find that CS torsion vanishes only if the coupling vanishes, thus\ngenerically leading to a modification of gyroscopic precession, irrespective of\nthe coupling choice. Perhaps most interestingly, we couple fermions to CS\nmodified gravity via the standard Dirac action and find that these further\ncorrect the torsion tensor. Such a correction leads to two new results: (i) a\ngeneric enhancement of CS modified gravity by the Dirac equation and axial\nfermion currents; (ii) a new two-fermion interactions, mediated by an axial\ncurrent and the CS correction.

The\nmain contribution of this paper is, therefore, to show that as long as $k-r+1$\ncorrect supports are included in any $k$-sparse CS solution, the optimal $k-r$\npartial support can be found using a subspace fitting criterion, significantly\nimproving the overall performance of CS-MUSIC.

With this\nreduction would come, in theory, commensurate reductions in the size, weight,\npower consumption, and/or monetary cost of both signal sensors and any\nassociated communication links. This paper examines the use of CS in the design\nof a wideband radio receiver in a noisy environment. We formulate the problem\nstatement for such a receiver and establish a reasonable set of requirements\nthat a receiver should meet to be practically useful. We then evaluate the\nperformance of a CS-based receiver in two ways: via a theoretical analysis of\nits expected performance, with a particular emphasis on noise and dynamic\nrange, and via simulations that compare the CS receiver against the performance\nexpected from a conventional implementation. On the one hand, we show that\nCS-based systems that aim to reduce the number of acquired measurements are\nsomewhat sensitive to signal noise, exhibiting a 3dB SNR loss per octave of\nsubsampling, which parallels the classic noise-folding phenomenon. On the other\nhand, we demonstrate that since they sample at a lower rate, CS-based systems\ncan potentially attain a significantly larger dynamic range. Hence, we conclude\nthat while a CS-based system has inherent limitations that do impose some\nrestrictions on its potential applications, it also has attributes that make it\nhighly desirable in a number of important practical settings.",

However, most of the previous work in WSN has used CS under the\nassumption that data field is smooth with negligible white Gaussian noise. In\nthese schemes signal sparsity is estimated globally based on the entire data\nfield, which is then used to determine the CS parameters. In more realistic\nscenarios, where data field may have regional fluctuations or it is piecewise\nsmooth, existing CS based data aggregation schemes yield poor compression\nefficiency. In order to take full advantage of CS in WSNs, we propose an\nAdaptive Hierarchical Data Aggregation using Compressive Sensing (A-HDACS)\nscheme. The proposed schemes dynamically chooses sparsity values based on\nsignal variations in local regions.

A possible remedy can be found in the promising new theory\nof compressed sensing (CS), which allows for the accurate recovery of sparse\nsignals from sub-Nyquist sampling given certain measurement conditions. We\nprovide an introductory assessment of optimal arrays for CS in snapshot-mode\nradio interferometry, using orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), a widely used CS\nrecovery algorithm similar in some respects to CLEAN. We focus on centrally\ncondensed (specifically, Gaussian) arrays versus uniform arrays, and the\nprinciple of randomization versus deterministic arrays such as the VLA. The\ntheory of CS is grounded in $a)$ sparse representation of signals and $b)$\nmeasurement matrices of low coherence. We calculate a related quantity, mutual\ncoherence (MC), as a theoretical indicator of arrays' suitability for OMP based\non the recovery error bounds in (Donoho et al. 2006). OMP reconstructions of\nboth point and extended objects are also run from simulated incomplete data.\nOptimal arrays are considered for object recovery through 1) the natural pixel\nrepresentation and 2) the representation by the block discrete cosine transform\n(BDCT). We find that reconstructions of the pixel representation perform best\nwith the uniform random array, while reconstructions of the BDCT representation\nperform best with normal random arrays. Slight randomization to the VLA also\nimproves it hugely for CS with the pixel basis. In the pixel basis, array\ndesign for CS reflects known principles of array design for small numbers of\nantennas, namely of randomness and uniform distribution.

The selected probe is\nthe CS molecule that needs high densities for excitation of its rotational\nlevels. To gauge the state of excitation, the cores were observed in two\ntransitions. In a limited number of cases, optical depths were derived from\ncomplementing lines of the rarer isotopologue C34S for the (2-1) and (3-2)\ntransitions. Making small (3arcmin by 3arcmin) maps, the 471 optically selected\ncores were searched for CS(2-1) and 315 (67%) were detected (T_A*>3sigma). In\ngeneral, the position of peak CS emission does not coincide with the optically\ndetermined centre of the cores. The cores appear cold (T<10K) and, in the\nmajority of cases, the CS emission is optically thin (tau<1). On the arcminute\nscales of the observations, the median column density of carbon monosulfide is\nN(CS)=7.E12/cm2. For an average abundance of N(CS)/N(H2)=1.E-8, the median mass\nof the detected cores is 1.0Msun. The line shapes are most often Gaussian with\nwidths exceeding that due to thermal broadening of <0.1km/s. The observed\nmedian FWHM=0.7km/s, i.e. non-thermal turbulence contributes dominantly to the\nline widths",

We measure the coldest spot, found\nby applying the Spherical Mexican Hat Wavelet transform on 100 000 cut-sky\n(masked) and full-sky CMB simulated maps. The CS itself is barely affected by\nthe mask; we estimate a 94 per cent probability that the CS is the full-sky\ntemperature minimum. However, approximately 48 per cent (masked fraction of the\nmask) of full-sky minima are obscured by the mask. Since the observed minima\nare slightly hotter than the full-sky ensemble of minima, a cut-sky analysis\nwould have found the CS to be significant at approximately 2.2 sigma with a\nwavelet angular scale of R = 5 degrees. None the less, comparisons to full-sky\nminima show the CS significance to be only approximately 1.9 sigma and less\nthan 2 sigma for all R. The CS on the last scattering surface may be hotter due\nto the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect in the line of sight.

    "abstract": "Robust compressive sensing(CS) reconstruction has become an attractive\nresearch topic in recent years. Robust CS aims to reconstruct the sparse\nsignals under non-Gaussian(i.e. heavy tailed) noises where traditional CS\nreconstruction algorithms may perform very poorly due to utilizing $l_2$ norm\nof the residual vector in optimization. Most of existing robust CS\nreconstruction algorithms are based on greedy pursuit method or convex\nrelaxation approach. Recently, the adaptive filtering framework has been\nintroduced to deal with the CS reconstruction, which shows desirable\nperformance in both efficiency and reconstruction performance under Gaussian\nnoise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive filtering based robust CS\nreconstruction algorithm, called $l_0$ regularized maximum correntropy\ncriterion($l_0$-MCC) algorithm, which combines the adaptive filtering framework\nand maximum correntropy criterion(MCC). MCC has recently been successfully used\nin adaptive filtering due to its robustness to impulsive non-Gaussian noises\nand low computational complexity. We analyze theoretically the stability of the\nproposed $l_0$-MCC algorithm. A mini-batch based $l_0$-MCC(MB-$l_0$-MCC)\nalgorithm is further developed to speed up the convergence. Comparison with\nexisting robust CS reconstruction algorithms is conducted via simulations,\nshowing that the proposed $l_0$-MCC and MB-$l_0$-MCC can achieve significantly\nbetter performance than other algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) are the most common class of core-collapse SNe.\nThey often show rapid increase of polarization degree in the late phase. This\ntime evolution is generally believed to originate from the emergence of an\ninner aspherical core, while an effect of polarized-scattered echoes by\ncircumstellar (CS) dust around the SN may also substantially contribute to this\npolarization feature. In this study, we examine the effects of the scatted\nechoes on the SN polarization through radiative transfer simulations for\nvarious geometry and amount of CS dust. It has been found that\nasymmetrically-distributed CS dust, which is generally inferred for red\nsupergiants, could reproduce the observed polarization features. We have\napplied our results to SNe 2004dj and 2006ov, deriving the geometry and amount\nof CS dust to explain their observed polarization features in this scenario.\nFor both SNe, the blob-like or bipolar distribution of CS dust rather than the\ndisk-like distribution is favored. The derived dust mass $M_{\\mathrm{dust}}$ in\nthe blob model (the bipolar CS dust model) for SNe 2004dj and 2006ov are $\\sim\n7.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ ($\\sim 8.5 \\times10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and\n$\\sim 5.2 \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ ($\\sim 1.3 \\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$),\nrespectively. Even in the case where this process would not play a dominant\nrole in the observed polarization signals, this effect should in principle\ncontribute to it, the strength of which depends on the nature of CS dust.\nTherefore, this effect must be taken into account in discussing\nmulti-dimensional structure of an SN explosion through polarimetric\nobservations.",

The most widely used CS-MRI model, founded on the\npremise of reconstructing an image from an incompletely filled k-space, leads\nto an ill-posed inverse problem. In the past years, lots of efforts have been\nmade to efficiently optimize the CS-MRI model.

Unfortunately, the convergence issues (due to the\nexperience-based networks) and the robustness (i.e., lack real-world noise\nmodeling) of these deeply trained optimization methods are still missing. In\nthis work, we develop a new paradigm to integrate designed numerical solvers\nand the data-driven architectures for CS-MRI.

In each communication round\nof FL, the clients update local models based on their own data and upload their\nlocal updates via wireless channels. However, latency caused by hundreds to\nthousands of communication rounds remains a bottleneck in FL. To minimize the\ntraining latency, this work provides a multi-armed bandit-based framework for\nonline client scheduling (CS) in FL without knowing wireless channel state\ninformation and statistical characteristics of clients. Firstly, we propose a\nCS algorithm based on the upper confidence bound policy (CS-UCB) for ideal\nscenarios where local datasets of clients are independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) and balanced. An upper bound of the expected performance\nregret of the proposed CS-UCB algorithm is provided, which indicates that the\nregret grows logarithmically over communication rounds. Then, to address\nnon-ideal scenarios with non-i.i.d. and unbalanced properties of local datasets\nand varying availability of clients, we further propose a CS algorithm based on\nthe UCB policy and virtual queue technique (CS-UCB-Q). An upper bound is also\nderived, which shows that the expected performance regret of the proposed\nCS-UCB-Q algorithm can have a sub-linear growth over communication rounds under\ncertain conditions. Besides, the convergence performance of FL training is also\nanalyzed. Finally, simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithms.",

Metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5 are known to exhibit considerable\nstar - to - star variations of many elements. This quartet confirms this\nconclusion. CS 22877-1 and CS 22166-16 are carbon-rich. There is significant\nspread for [$\\alpha$/Fe] within our sample where [$\\alpha$/Fe] is computed from\nthe mean of the [Mg/Fe], and [Ca/Fe] ratios. BS 16085 - 0050 is remarkably\n$\\alpha$ enriched with a mean [$\\alpha$/Fe] of $+$0.7 but CS 22169-35 is\n$\\alpha$-poor. The aluminium abundance also shows a significant variation over\nthe sample.

    "abstract": "The potential of compressive sensing (CS) has spurred great interest in the\nresearch community and is a fast growing area of research. However, research\ntranslating CS theory into practical hardware and demonstrating clear and\nsignificant benefits with this hardware over current, conventional imaging\ntechniques has been limited. This article helps researchers to find those niche\napplications where the CS approach provides substantial gain over conventional\napproaches by articulating lessons learned in finding one such application; sea\nskimming missile detection. As a proof of concept, it is demonstrated that a\nsimplified CS missile detection architecture and algorithm provides comparable\nresults to the conventional imaging approach but using a smaller FPA. The\nprimary message is that all of the excitement surrounding CS is necessary and\nappropriate for encouraging our creativity but we all must also take off our\n\"rose colored glasses\" and critically judge our ideas, methods and results\nrelative to conventional imaging approaches.",

    "abstract": "A new reconstruction method of complex-valued fractional Brownian motion\n(CV-fBm) field based on Compressive Sampling (CS) is proposed. The decay\nproperty of Fourier coefficients magnitude of the fBm signals/ fields indicates\nthat fBms are compressible. Therefore, a few numbers of samples will be\nsufficient for a CS based method to reconstruct the full field. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is showed by simulating, random sampling,\nand reconstructing CV-fBm fields. Performance evaluation shows advantages of\nthe proposed method over boxcar filtering and thin plate methods. It is also\nfound that the reconstruction performance depends on both of the fBm's Hurst\nparameter and the number of samples, which in fact is consistent with the CS\nreconstruction theory. In contrast to other fBm or fractal interpolation\nmethods, the proposed CS based method does not require the knowledge of fractal\nparameters in the reconstruction process; the inherent sparsity is just\nsufficient for the CS to do the reconstruction. Potential applicability of the\nproposed method in weak gravitational lensing survey, particularly for\ninterpolating non-smooth PSF (Point Spread Function) distribution representing\ndistortion by a turbulent field is also discussed.",

The foundation of CS-DPP is an online LSDR framework derived from a\nleading LSDR algorithm. In particular, CS-DPP is equipped with an efficient\nonline dimension reducer motivated by matrix stochastic gradient, and\nestablishes its theoretical backbone when coupled with a carefully-designed\nonline regression learner. In addition, CS-DPP embeds the cost information into\nlabel weights to achieve cost-sensitivity along with theoretical guarantees.\nExperimental results verify that CS-DPP achieves better practical performance\nthan current MLC algorithms across different evaluation criteria, and\ndemonstrate the importance of resolving the three issues simultaneously.",

The decline of\nthe Os moment from 1.73 mu_B/Os for the simple d1 spin, particularly for Cs, is\nlikely to originate from the antiparallel orbital moment, although the\nspin-orbit coupling is generally quenched in the low-lying e orbitals.",

    "abstract": "Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a notoriously slow technique;\nData-recording is serial which renders complex measurement tasks, such as\nquasiparticle interference (QPI) mapping, impractical. However, QPI would\nprovide insight into band-structure details of quantum materials which can be\ninaccessible to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Here we use\ncompressed sensing (CS) to fundamentally speed-up QPI mapping. We reliably\nrecover the QPI information from a fraction of the usual local density of state\nmeasurements. The requirement of CS is naturally fulfilled for QPI, since CS\nrelies on sparsity in a vector domain, here given by few nonzero coefficients\nin Fourier space. We exemplify CS on a simulated Cu(111) surface using random\nsampling of constant and varying probability density. We further simplify the\nmotion of the STM tip through an open traveling salesman's problem for greater\nefficiency. We expect that the implications of our CS approach will be\ntransformative for the exploration of 2D quantum materials.",

The maximum of the\nHusimi-Kano $Q$ quasiprobability distribution is used to diagnose where in\nphase space the eigenstates of the generators lie. The $Q$ function of a\ngenerator eigenstate is constant along each orbit. We conjecture that the\nmaximum of the $Q$ function corresponds to these privileged in phase orbits.

In spite of the\nexpectation that the CN and CS morphology might closely follow the dense gas\ntraced by the dust continuum, both molecules avoid the most central cores.\nComparing the relative line strengths of various CN hyperfine components, this\nappears not to be an opacity effect but to be due to chemical and physical\neffects. The CN data also indicate enhanced emission toward the different\nmolecular outflows in the region. Regarding CS, avoiding the central cores can\nbe due to high optical depth, but the data also show that the CS emission is\nnearly always associated with the outflows of the region. Therefore, neither CS\nnor CN appear well suited for dense gas and disk studies in these two sources,\nand we recommend the use of different molecules for future massive disk\nstudies. An analysis of the 1 and 3mm continuum fluxes toward IRAS20293+3952\nreveals that the dust opacity index beta is lower than the canonical value of\n2. Tentatively, we identify a decreasing gradient of beta from the edge of the\ncore to the core center. This could be due to increasing optical depth toward\nthe core center and/or grain growth within the densest cores and potential\ncentral disks.

Of the 15 K- and M-type members, eight show excess\nemission. We find that the presence of a CS disk is anti-correlated with\nbinarity, with all but one disk associated with single stars. With nine single\nstars in total, about 80% retain a CS disk. Of the six known or suspected close\nbinaries the only CS disk is associated with the primary of RECX 9. No\ncircumbinary disks have been detected. We also find that stars with disks are\nslow rotators with surface values of specific angular momentum j = 2-15 j_sun.\nAll high specific angular momentum systems with j = 20-30 j_sun are confined to\nthe primary stars of binaries. This provides novel empirical evidence for\nrotational disk locking and again demonstrates the much shorter disk lifetimes\nin close binary systems compared to single star systems. We estimate the\ncharacteristic mean disk dissipation timescale to be ~5 Myr and ~9 Myr for the\nbinary and single star systems, respectively.",

In order to investigate the lattice\nvibrations in the fcc phase and seek a possible dynamical instability of the\nlattice, the phonon spectra of fcc-Cs at volumes near the III-IV transition are\ncalculated using Savrasov's density functional linear-response LMTO method.\nCompared with quasiharmonic model calculations including non-central\ninteratomic forces up to second neighbours, at the volume $V/V_0= 0.44$ ($V_0$\nis the experimental volume of bcc-Cs with $a_0$=6.048{\\AA}), the\nlinear-response calculations show soft intermediate wavelength\n$T_{[1\\bar{1}0]}[{\\xi}{\\xi}0]$ phonons.

In particular, it is\npointed out that this parity (P) and time reversal (T) violating but gauge\ninvariant term when added to the Maxwell Lagrangian gives a massive gauge\nquanta and yet the theory is still gauge invariant. Further, the vacuum of such\na theory shows the magneto-electric effect. Besides, we show that the CS term\ncan also be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking as well as by radiative\ncorrections. A detailed discussion about Coleman-Hill theorem is also given\nwhich aserts that the parity-odd piece of the vacuum polarization tensor at\nzero momentum transfer is unaffected by two and multi-loop effects. Topological\nquantization of the coefficient of the CS term in nonabelian gauge theories is\nalso elaborated in some detail.

In this paper, we examine the effect of re-emission of SN\nphotons by CS dust in the infrared (IR) wavelength regime. This effect allows\nthe observed IR light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/size\nand the amount of CS dust. The method was applied to observed near-infrared\n(NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived\neven under conservative assumptions. We thereby clarify a difficulty associated\nwith the CS dust scattering model as a general explanation for the peculiar\nreddening law, while it may still apply to a sub-sample of highly reddened SNe\nIa. For SNe Ia in general, the environment at the interstellar scale appears to\nbe responsible for the non-standard extinction law.

Demodulators of this form have been studied before under then name\nchannel shortening (CS), but the interplay between CS and interference\ncancelation has not been adequately addressed in the literature. In this paper,\nwe analyze two types of CS demodulators that are based on the Forney and\nUngerboeck detection models, respectively. The parameters are jointly optimized\nbased on a generalized mutual information (GMI) function. We also introduce a\nthird type of CS demodulator that is in general suboptimal but has closed form\nsolutions for all parameters. Moreover, signal to noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic\nproperties are analyzed and we show that the third CS demodulator\nasymptotically converges to the optimal CS demodulator in the sense of\nmaximizing the GMI.",

    "abstract": "Many astronomical objects are surrounded by dusty environments. In such dusty\nobjects, multiple scattering processes of photons by circumstellar (CS) dust\ngrains can effectively alter extinction properties. In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate effects of multiple scattering on extinction laws\nfor steady-emission sources surrounded by the dusty CS medium, using a\nradiation transfer simulation based on the Monte Carlo technique. In\nparticular, we focus on whether and how the extinction properties are affected\nby properties of CS dust grains, adopting various dust grain models. We {\\bf\nconfirm} that behaviors of the (effective) extinction laws are highly dependent\non the properties of CS grains. Especially, the total-to-selective extinction\nratio $R_{V}$, which characterizes the extinction law, can be either increased\nor decreased, compared to the case without multiple scattering. We find that\nthe criterion for this behavior is given by a ratio of albedos in the $B$ and\n$V$ bands. We also find that either small silicate grains or polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are necessary for realizing a low value of $R_{V}$\nas often measured toward Type Ia supernovae, if the multiple scattering by CS\ndust is responsible for their non-standard extinction laws. Using the derived\nrelations between the properties of dust grains and the resulting effective\nextinction laws, we propose that the extinction laws toward dusty objects could\nbe used to constrain the properties of dust grains in CS environments.",

    "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) theory states that real-world signals can often be\nrecovered from much fewer measurements than those suggested by the Shannon\nsampling theorem. Nevertheless, recoverability does not only depend on the\nsignal, but also on the measurement scheme. The measurement matrix should\nbehave as close as possible to an isometry for the signals of interest.\nTherefore the search for optimal CS measurement matrices of size $m\\times n$\ntranslates into the search for a set of $n$ $m$-dimensional vectors with\nminimal coherence. Best Complex Antipodal Spherical Codes (BCASCs) are known to\nbe optimal in terms of coherence. An iterative algorithm for BCASC generation\nhas been recently proposed that tightly approaches the theoretical lower bound\non coherence. Unfortunately, the complexity of each iteration depends\nquadratically on $m$ and $n$. In this work we propose a modification of the\nalgorithm that allows reducing the quadratic complexity to linear on both $m$\nand $n$. Numerical evaluation showed that the proposed approach does not worsen\nthe coherence of the resulting BCASCs. On the contrary, an improvement was\nobserved for large $n$. The reduction of the computational complexity paves the\nway for using the BCASCs as CS measurement matrices in problems with large $n$.\nWe evaluate the CS performance of the BCASCs for recovering sparse signals. The\nBCASCs are shown to outperform both complex random matrices and Fourier\nensembles as CS measurement matrices, both in terms of coherence and sparse\nrecovery performance, especially for low $m/n$, which is the case of interest\nin CS.",

    "abstract": "Yannakakis' Clique versus Independent Set problem (CL-IS) in communication\ncomplexity asks for the minimum number of cuts separating cliques from stable\nsets in a graph, called CS-separator. Yannakakis provides a quasi-polynomial\nCS-separator, i.e. of size $O(n^{\\log n})$, and addresses the problem of\nfinding a polynomial CS-separator. This question is still open even for perfect\ngraphs. We show that a polynomial CS-separator almost surely exists for random\ngraphs. Besides, if H is a split graph (i.e. has a vertex-partition into a\nclique and a stable set) then there exists a constant $c_H$ for which we find a\n$O(n^{c_H})$ CS-separator on the class of H-free graphs. This generalizes a\nresult of Yannakakis on comparability graphs. We also provide a $O(n^{c_k})$\nCS-separator on the class of graphs without induced path of length k and its\ncomplement. Observe that on one side, $c_H$ is of order $O(|H| \\log |H|)$\nresulting from Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, and on the other side, $c_k$ is\nexponential.\n  One of the main reason why Yannakakis' CL-IS problem is fascinating is that\nit admits equivalent formulations. Our main result in this respect is to show\nthat a polynomial CS-separator is equivalent to the polynomial\nAlon-Saks-Seymour Conjecture, asserting that if a graph has an edge-partition\ninto k complete bipartite graphs, then its chromatic number is polynomially\nbounded in terms of k. We also show that the classical approach to the stubborn\nproblem (arising in CSP) which consists in covering the set of all solutions by\n$O(n^{\\log n})$ instances of 2-SAT is again equivalent to the existence of a\npolynomial CS-separator.",

In particular, Cs$_2$BiAgX$_6$ (X =\nCl, Br) have been synthesized and found to exhibit band gaps in the visible\nrange. However, the band gaps of these compounds are indirect, which is not\nideal for applications in thin film photovoltaics. Here, we propose a new class\nof halide double perovskites, where the B$^{3+}$ and B$^{+}$ cations are\nIn$^{3+}$ and Ag$^{+}$, respectively. Our first-principles calculations\nindicate that the hypothetical compounds Cs$_2$InAgX$_6$ (X = Cl, Br, I) should\nexhibit direct band gaps between the visible (I) and the ultraviolet (Cl).\nBased on these predictions, we attempt to synthesize Cs$_2$InAgCl$_6$ and\nCs$_2$InAgBr$_6$, and we succeed to form the hitherto unknown double perovskite\nCs$_2$InAgCl$_6$. X-ray diffraction yields a double perovskite structure with\nspace group $Fm\\overline{3}m$. The measured band gap is 3.3 eV, and the\ncompound is found to be photosensitive and turns reversibly from white to\norange under ultraviolet illumination. We also perform an empirical analysis of\nthe stability of Cs$_2$InAgX$_6$ and their mixed halides based on Goldschmidt's\nrules, and we find that it should also be possible to form\nCs$_2$InAg(Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_{x}$)$_6$ for $x<1$.

    "abstract": "Halide perovskites constitute a chemically-diverse class of crystals with\ngreat promise as photovoltaic absorber materials, featuring band gaps between\nabout 1 and 3.5 eV depending on composition. Their diversity calls for a\ngeneral computational approach to predicting their band gaps. However, such an\napproach is still lacking. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) and\nmany-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation to compute the\nquasiparticle or fundamental band gap of a set of ten representative halide\nperovskites: CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPbI$_3$), MAPbBr$_3$, CsSnBr$_3$,\n(MA)$_2$BiTlBr$_6$, Cs$_2$TlAgBr$_6$, Cs$_2$TlAgCl$_6$, Cs$_2$BiAgBr$_6$,\nCs$_2$InAgCl$_6$, Cs$_2$SnBr$_6$, and Cs$_2$Au$_2$I$_6$. Comparing with recent\nmeasurements, we find that a standard generalized gradient exchange-correlation\nfunctional can significantly underestimate the experimental band gaps of these\nperovskites, particularly in cases with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and\nhighly dispersive band edges, to a degree that varies with composition. We show\nthat these nonsystematic errors are inherited by one-shot G$_0$W$_0$ and\neigenvalue self-consistent GW$_0$ calculations, demonstrating that semilocal\nDFT starting points are insufficient for MAPbI$_3$, MAPbBr$_3$, CsSnBr$_3$,\n(MA)$_2$BiTlBr$_6$, Cs$_2$TlAgBr$_6$, and Cs$_2$TlAgCl$_6$. On the other hand,\nwe find that DFT with hybrid functionals leads to an improved starting point\nand GW$_0$ results in better agreement with experiment for these perovskites.\nOur results suggest that GW$_0$ with hybrid functional-based starting points\nare promising for predicting band gaps of systems with large SOC and dispersive\nbands in this technologically important class of semiconducting crystals.",

Sequences encoded with constrained\nsequence codes satisfy constraints imposed by the physical channel to enable\nefficient and reliable transmission of coded symbols. In this paper, we propose\nusing deep learning approaches to decode fixed-length and variable-length CS\ncodes. Traditional encoding and decoding of fixed-length CS codes rely on\nlook-up tables (LUTs), which is prone to errors that occur during transmission.\nWe introduce fixed-length constrained sequence decoding based on multiple layer\nperception (MLP) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and\ndemonstrate that we are able to achieve low bit error rates that are close to\nmaximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding as well as improve the system\nthroughput. Further, implementation of capacity-achieving fixed-length codes,\nwhere the complexity is prohibitively high with LUT decoding, becomes practical\nwith deep learning-based decoding. We then consider CNN-aided decoding of\nvariable-length CS codes. Different from conventional decoding where the\nreceived sequence is processed bit-by-bit, we propose using CNNs to perform\none-shot batch-processing of variable-length CS codes such that an entire batch\nis decoded at once, which improves the system throughput. Moreover, since the\nCNNs can exploit global information with batch-processing instead of only\nmaking use of local information as in conventional bit-by-bit processing, the\nerror rates can be reduced. We present simulation results that show excellent\nperformance with both fixed-length and variable-length CS codes that are used\nin the frontiers of wireless communication systems.",

Moreover, the gender disparity in\ntechnology related fields is a serious problem. Even if companies want to hire\nwomen in technology, the number of women who enter these fields is remarkably\nlow.

Thus,\nthey may never understand the fundamental concepts of CS, have unrealistic\nexpectations or preconceptions, and are influenced by stereotype-based\nexpectations. Consequently, many teenagers exclude computing as a career path.\nIn this research study, we present two promising concepts to overcome these\nchallenges. First, we consider alternative paths to enter the field of CS. In\n2018, a voluntary lecture \"Design your own app\" at the University of Graz for\nstudents of all degree programs was introduced. In total, 202 students\nparticipated. We applied a Game Development-Based Learning (GDBL) approach with\nthe visual coding tool Pocket Code, a mobile app developed at Graz University\nof Technology.

The course received positive evaluations and led to our second\nconcept; In January 2019, we started to design a MOOC (Massive Open Online\nCourse) with the title \"Get FIT in Computer Science\". First, this course can be\nused to encourage young women who have little to no previous knowledge in CS.\nSecond, it should help all teenagers to get a more realistic picture of CS to\nits basic concepts. Third, teachers can use the course materials to lead high\nschool classes (Open Educational Resources). Finally, the MOOC can be accessed\nby everyone interested in this topic.",

    "abstract": "Researchers in the biological sciences nowadays often encounter the curse of\nhigh-dimensionality, which many previously developed statistical models fail to\novercome. To tackle this problem, sufficient dimension reduction aims to\nestimate the central subspace (CS), in which all the necessary information\nsupplied by the covariates regarding the response of interest is contained.\nSubsequent statistical analysis can then be made in a lower-dimensional space\nwhile preserving relevant information. Oftentimes studies are interested in a\ncertain transformation of the response (the induced response), instead of the\noriginal one, whose corresponding CS may vary. When estimating the CS of the\ninduced response, existing dimension reduction methods may, however, suffer the\nproblem of inefficiency. In this article, we propose a more efficient two-stage\nestimation procedure to estimate the CS of an induced response. This approach\nis further extended to the case of censored responses. An application for\ncombining multiple biomarkers is also illustrated. Simulation studies and two\ndata examples provide further evidence of the usefulness of the proposed\nmethod.",

Since in CS application, we have compressively sensed image\ninstead of full image, existing methods of designing matched wavelet cannot be\nused. Thus, we propose a joint framework that estimates matched wavelet from\nthe compressively sensed images and also reconstructs full images. This paper\nhas three significant contributions. First, lifting-based, image-matched\nseparable wavelet is designed from compressively sensed images and is also used\nto reconstruct the same. Second, a simple sensing matrix is employed to sample\ndata at sub-Nyquist rate such that sensing and reconstruction time is reduced\nconsiderably without any noticeable degradation in the reconstruction\nperformance. Third, a new multi-level L-Pyramid wavelet decomposition strategy\nis provided for separable wavelet implementation on images that leads to\nimproved reconstruction performance.

Experimental results demonstrate that the\nnovel CS recovery strategy achieves significant performance improvements over\nthe current state-of-the-art schemes and exhibits nice convergence.",

    "title": "Deep Networks for Compressed Image Sensing",
    "abstract": "The compressed sensing (CS) theory has been successfully applied to image\ncompression in the past few years as most image signals are sparse in a certain\ndomain. Several CS reconstruction models have been recently proposed and\nobtained superior performance. However, there still exist two important\nchallenges within the CS theory. The first one is how to design a sampling\nmechanism to achieve an optimal sampling efficiency, and the second one is how\nto perform the reconstruction to get the highest quality to achieve an optimal\nsignal recovery. In this paper, we try to deal with these two problems with a\ndeep network. First of all, we train a sampling matrix via the network training\ninstead of using a traditional manually designed one, which is much appropriate\nfor our deep network based reconstruct process. Then, we propose a deep network\nto recover the image, which imitates traditional compressed sensing\nreconstruction processes. Experimental results demonstrate that our deep\nnetworks based CS reconstruction method offers a very significant quality\nimprovement compared against state of the art ones.",

In traditional CS-MRI inversion methods, the fact that\nthe energy within the Fourier measurement domain is distributed non-uniformly\nis often neglected during reconstruction.

In this paper, we\npropose a new framework for CS-MRI inversion in which we decompose the observed\nk-space data into \"subspaces\" via sets of filters in a lossless way, and\nreconstruct the images in these various spaces individually using off-the-shelf\nalgorithms.

Our (CS) limit result\nalso provides the critical clue to answer the open problems raised by\n[Ricciardi,Tarantello (2000)] and [Tarantello (2004)], and we succeed to\nestablish the existence of periodic Maxwell-Chern-Simons vortices satisfying\nthe concentrating property of the density of superconductive electron pairs.\nFurthermore, we expect that the (CS) limit analysis in this paper would help to\nstudy the stability, multiplicity, and bubbling phenomena for solutions of the\n(MCS) model.",

    "title": "Topological interactions in broken gauge theories",
    "abstract": "This thesis deals with planar gauge theories in which some gauge group G is\nspontaneously broken to a finite subgroup H. The spectrum consists of magnetic\nvortices, global H charges and dyonic combinations exhibiting topological\nAharonov-Bohm interactions. Among other things, we review the Hopf algebra D(H)\nrelated to this residual discrete H gauge theory, which provides an unified\ndescription of the spin, braid and fusion properties of the aforementioned\nparticles. The implications of adding a Chern-Simons (CS) term to these models\nare also addressed. We recall that the CS actions for a compact gauge group G\nare classified by the cohomology group H^4(BG,Z). For finite groups H this\nclassification boils down to the cohomology group H^3(H,U(1)). Thus the\ndifferent CS actions for a finite group H are given by the inequivalent\n3-cocycles of H. It is argued that adding a CS action for the broken gauge\ngroup G leads to additional topological interactions for the vortices governed\nby a 3-cocycle for the residual finite gauge group H determined by a natural\nhomomorphism from H^4(BG,Z) to H^3(H,U(1)). Accordingly, the related Hopf\nalgebra D(H) is deformed into a quasi-Hopf algebra. These general\nconsiderations are illustrated by CS theories in which the direct product of\nsome U(1) gauge groups is broken to a finite subgroup H. It turns out that not\nall conceivable 3-cocycles for finite abelian gauge groups H can be obtained in\nthis way. Those that are not reached are the most interesting. A Z_2 x Z_2 x\nZ_2 CS theory given by such a 3-cocycle, for instance, is dual to an ordinary\ngauge theory with nonabelian gauge group the dihedral group of order eight.\nFinally, the CS theories with nonabelian finite gauge group a dihedral or\ndouble dihedral group are also discussed in full detail.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: The chemistry in the inner few thousand AU of accreting envelopes\naround young stellar objects is predicted to vary greatly with far-UV and X-ray\nirradiation by the central star. Aim We search for molecular tracers of\nhigh-energy irradiation by the protostar in the hot inner envelope. METHODS:\nThe Submillimeter Array (SMA) has observed the high-mass star forming region\nAFGL 2591 in lines of CS, SO, HCN, HCN(v2=1), and HC15N with 0.6\" resolution at\n350 GHz probing radial scales of 600-3500 AU for an assumed distance of 1 kpc.\nThe SMA observations are compared with the predictions of a chemical model\nfitted to previous single-dish observations. RESULTS: The CS and SO main peaks\nare extended in space at the FWHM level, as predicted in the model assuming\nprotostellar X-rays. However, the main peak sizes are found smaller than\nmodeled by nearly a factor of 2. On the other hand, the lines of CS, HCN, and\nHC15N, but not SO and HCN(v2=1), show pedestal emissions at radii of about 3500\nAU that are not predicted. All lines except SO show a secondary peak within the\napproaching outflow cone. A dip or null in the visibilities caused by a sharp\ndecrease in abundance with increasing radius is not observed in CS and only\ntentatively in SO. CONCLUSIONS: The emission of protostellar X-rays is\nsupported by the good fit of the modeled SO and CS amplitude visibilities\nincluding an extended main peak in CS. The broad pedestals can be interpreted\nby far-UV irradiation in a spherically non-symmetric geometry, possibly\ncomprising outflow walls on scales of 3500 -- 7000 AU. The extended CS and SO\nmain peaks suggest sulfur evaporation near the 100 K temperature radius.",

    "abstract": "We present observations of rotational lines of H2S, SO and CS performed in\ncomet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) in March 1997 with the Plateau de Bure\ninterferometer (IRAM). The observations provide informations on the spatial and\nvelocity distributions of these molecules. They can be used to constrain their\nphotodissociation rate and their origin. We use a radiative transfer code which\nallows us to compute synthetic line profiles and interferometric maps, to be\ncompared to the observations. Both single-dish spectra and interferometric\nspectral maps show a day/night asymmetry in the outgassing. From the analysis\nof the spectral maps, including the astrometry, we show that SO and CS present\nin addition a jet-like structure that may be the gaseous counterpart of the\ndust high-latitude jet observed in optical images. A CS rotating jet is also\nobserved. Using the astrometry provided by continuum radio maps obtained in\nparallel, we conclude that there is no need to invoke of nongravitational\nforces acting on this comet, and provide an updated orbit. The radial extension\nof H2S is found to be consistent with direct release from the nucleus. SO\ndisplays an extended radial distribution. Assuming that SO2 is the parent of\nSO, the photodissociation rate of SO is measured to be 1.5 E-4 s-1 at 1 AU from\nthe Sun. This is lower than most laboratory-based estimates and may suggest\nthat SO is not solely produced by SO2 photolysis. From the observations of\nJ(2-1) and J(5-4) CS lines, we deduce a CS photodissociation rate of 1 to 5 E-5\ns-1. The photodissociation rate of CS2, the likely parent of CS, cannot be\nconstrained due to insufficient resolution, but our data are consistent with\npublished values.

    "abstract": "A post-CME current sheet (CS) is a common feature developed behind an\nerupting flux rope in CME models. Observationally, white light observations\nhave recorded many occurrences of a thin ray appearing behind a CME eruption\nthat closely resembles a post-CME CS in its spatial correspondence and\nmorphology. UV and X-ray observations further strengthen this interpretation by\nthe observations of high temperature emission at locations consistent with\nmodel predictions. The next question then becomes whether the properties inside\na post-CME CS predicted by a model agree with observed properties. In this\nwork, we assume that the post-CME CS is a consequence of Petschek-like\nreconnection and that the observed ray-like structure is bounded by a pair of\nslow mode shocks developed from the reconnection site. We perform\ntime-dependent ionization calculations and model the UV line emission. We find\nthat such a model is consistent with SOHO/UVCS observations of the post-CME CS.\nThe change of Fe XVIII emission in one event implies an inflow speed of ~10\nkm/s and a corresponding reconnection rate of M_A ~ 0.01. We calculate the\nexpected X-ray emission for comparison with X-ray observations by Hinode/XRT,\nas well as the ionic charge states as would be measured in-situ at 1 AU. We\nfind that the predicted count rate for Hinode/XRT agree with what was observed\nin a post-CME CS on April 9, 2008, and the predicted ionic charge states are\nconsistent with high ionization states commonly measured in the interplanetary\nCMEs. The model results depend strongly on the physical parameters in the\nambient corona, namely the coronal magnetic field, the electron density and\ntemperature during the CME event. It is crucial to obtain these ambient coronal\nparameters and as many facets of the CS properties as possible by observational\nmeans so that the post-CME current sheet models can be scrutinized more\neffectively.",

Turbulent motions can be\nconstrained by measuring the nonthermal broadening of line emission from heavy\nmolecules. We used the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer to study emission\nfrom the CS molecule in the disk of DM Tau. High spatial (1.4 x 1 \") and\nspectral resolution (0.126 km/s) CS J=3-2 images provide constraints on the\nmolecule distribution and velocity structure of the disk.

The intrinsic linewidth derived from the CS J=3-2\ndata is much larger than expected from pure thermal broadening. The magnitude\nof the derived nonthermal component depends only weakly on assumptions about\nthe location of the CS molecules with respect to the disk plane.

It is well known that these\ndefinitions become inequivalent if applied to finite $d$-level systems\n(qudits). We present a comparative Wigner-function description of the qudit CS\ndefined (i) by the action of the truncated displacement operator on the vacuum\nand (ii) by the Poissonian expansion in Fock states of the Glauber CS truncated\nat $(d-1)$-photon Fock state. These states can be generated from a classical\nlight by its optical truncation using nonlinear and linear quantum scissors\ndevices, respectively. We show a surprising effect that a macroscopically\ndistinguishable superposition of two qudit CS (according to both definitions)\ncan be generated with high fidelity by displacing the vacuum in the qudit\nHilbert space. If the qudit dimension $d$ is even (odd) then the superposition\nstate contains Fock states with only odd (even) photon numbers, which can be\nreferred to as the odd (even) qudit CS or the female (male) Schr\\\"odinger cat\nstate. This phenomenon can be interpreted as an interference of a single CS\nwith its reflection from the highest-energy Fock state of the Hilbert space, as\nclearly seen via phase-space interference of the Wigner function. We also\nanalyze nonclassical properties of the qudit CS including their photon-number\nstatistics and nonclassical volume of the Wigner function, which is a\nquantitative parameter of nonclassicality (quantumness) of states. Finally, we\nstudy optical tomograms, which can be directly measured in the homodyne\ndetection of the analyzed qudit cat states and enable the complete\nreconstructions of their Wigner functions.",

Because single-star evolution at the low stellar mass\nof present-epoch GCs was considered incapable of producing visible PNe, their\norigin presented a puzzle. We imaged the PN JaFu 1 with the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) to obtain photometry of its central star (CS) and\nhigh-resolution morphological information. We imaged IRAS 18333-2357 with\nbetter depth and resolution, and we analyzed its archival HST spectra to\nconstrain its CS temperature and luminosity. All PNe in Galactic GCs now have\nhigh-quality HST data, allowing us to improve CS mass estimates. We find\nreasonably consistent masses between 0.53 and 0.58 Msun for all four objects,\nthough estimates vary when adopting different stellar evolutionary\ncalculations. The CS mass of IRAS 18333-2357, though, depends strongly on its\ntemperature, which remains elusive due to reddening uncertainties. For all four\nobjects, we consider their CS and nebular masses, their morphologies, and other\nincongruities to assess the likelihood that these objects formed from binary\nstars. Although generally limited by uncertainties (~0.02 Msun) in post-AGB\ntracks and core mass vs. luminosity relations, the high-mass CS in K 648\nindicates a binary origin.

    "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) has been studied and applied in structural health\nmonitoring for wireless data acquisition and transmission, structural modal\nidentification, and spare damage identification. The key issue in CS is finding\nthe optimal solution for sparse optimization. In the past years, many\nalgorithms have been proposed in the field of applied mathematics. In this\npaper, we propose a machine-learning-based approach to solve the CS\ndata-reconstruction problem. By treating a computation process as a data flow,\nthe process of CS-based data reconstruction is formalized into a standard\nsupervised-learning task. The prior knowledge, i.e., the basis matrix and the\nCS-sampled signals, are used as the input and the target of the network; the\nbasis coefficient matrix is embedded as the parameters of a certain layer; the\nobjective function of conventional compressive sensing is set as the loss\nfunction of the network. Regularized by l1-norm, these basis coefficients are\noptimized to reduce the error between the original CS-sampled signals and the\nmasked reconstructed signals with a common optimization algorithm. Also, the\nproposed network can handle complex bases, such as a Fourier basis. Benefiting\nfrom the nature of a multi-neuron layer, multiple signal channels can be\nreconstructed simultaneously. Meanwhile, the disassembled use of a large-scale\nbasis makes the method memory-efficient. A numerical example of multiple\nsinusoidal waves and an example of field-test wireless data from a suspension\nbridge are carried out to illustrate the data-reconstruction ability of the\nproposed approach. The results show that high reconstruction accuracy can be\nobtained by the machine learning-based approach. Also, the parameters of the\nnetwork have clear meanings; the inference of the mapping between input and\noutput is fully transparent, making the CS data reconstruction neural network\ninterpretable.",

    "abstract": "Observations of various molecular lines toward a disk region of a nearby\ngalaxy are now feasible, and they are being employed as diagnostic tools to\nstudy star-formation activities there. However, the spatial resolution\nattainable for a nearby galaxy with currently available radio telescopes is\n$10-1000$ pc, which is much larger than the scales of individual star-forming\nregions and molecular cloud cores. Hence, it is of fundamental importance to\nelucidate which part of an interstellar medium such spatially-unresolved\nobservations are tracing. Here we present sensitive measurements of the H$_2$CO\n($1_{01}-0_{00}$) line at 72 GHz toward giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the\nspiral arm of M51 using the NRO 45 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes. In conjunction\nwith the previously observed H$_2$CO ($2_{02}-1_{01}$) and CS ($2-1$ and $3-2$)\nlines, we derive the H$_2$ density of the emitting regions to be\n$(0.6-2.6)\\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and $(2.9-12)\\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ for H$_2$CO\nand CS, respectively, by the non-LTE analyses, where we assume the source size\nof $0.8-1$ kpc and the gas kinetic temperature of $10-20$ K. The derived H$_2$\ndensity indicates that the emission of H$_2$CO and CS is not localized to\nstar-forming cores, but is likely distributed over an entire region of GMCs.\nSuch widespread distributions of H$_2$CO and CS are also supported by models\nassuming lognormal density distributions over the 1 kpc region. Thus,\ncontributions from the widespread less-dense components should be taken into\naccount for interpretation of these molecular emission observed with a\nGMC-scale resolution. The different H$_2$ densities derived for H$_2$CO and CS\nimply their different distributions. We discuss this differences in terms of\nthe formation processes of H$_2$CO and CS.",

    "abstract": "Planets form in protoplanetary disks and inherit their chemical composition.\nIt is therefore crucial to understand the disks molecular content. We aim to\ncharacterize the distribution and abundance of molecules in the disk of DG Tau.\nIn the context of the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in Taurus\n(ALMA-DOT) we analyse ALMA observations of the disk of DG Tau in H2CO\n3(1,2)-2(1,1), CS 5-4, and CN 2-1 at ~0.15\", i.e. ~18 au at 121 pc. H2CO and CS\noriginate from a disk ring at the edge of the 1.3mm dust continuum, with CS\nprobing an outer disk region with respect to H2CO (peaking at ~70 and ~60 au,\nrespectively). CN originates from an outermost disk/envelope region peaking at\n~80 au. H2CO is dominated by disk emission, while CS probes also two streams of\nmaterial possibly accreting onto the disk with a peak of emission where the\nstream connects to the disk. The ring- and disk-height- averaged column\ndensities are ~2.4-8.6e13 cm-2 (H2CO), ~1.7-2.5e13 cm-2 (CS), and ~1.9-4.7e13\ncm-2 (CN). Unsharp masking reveals a ring of enhanced dust emission at ~40 au,\ni.e. just outside the CO snowline (~30 au). CS and H2CO emissions are\nco-spatial suggesting that they are chemically linked. The observed rings of\nmolecular emission at the edge of the 1.3mm continuum may be due to dust\nopacity effects and/or continnum over-subtraction in the inner disk; as well as\nto increased UV penetration and/or temperature inversion at the edge of the\nmm-dust which would cause an enhanced gas-phase formation and desorption of\nthese molecules. Moreover, H2CO and CS originate from outside the ring of\nenhanced dust emission, which also coincides with a change of the linear\npolarization at 0.87mm. This suggests that outside the CO snowline there could\nbe a change of the dust properties which would reflect in the increase of the\nintensity (and change of polarization) of continuum, and of molecular emission.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery by Cayrel et al. of U in CS 31082-001 along with Os and\nIr at greatly enhanced abundances but with [Fe/H]=-2.9 strongly reinforces the\nargument that there are at least two kinds of SNII sources for r-nuclei. One\nsource is the high-frequency H events responsible for heavy r-nuclei (A>135)\nbut not Fe. The H-yields calculated from data on other ultra-metal-poor stars\nand the sun provide a template for quantitatively predicting the abundances of\nall other r-elements. In CS 31082-001 these should show a significant\ndeficiency at A<135 relative to the solar r-pattern. It is proposed that CS\n31082-001 should have had a companion that exploded as an SNII H event. If the\nbinary survived the explosion, this star should now have a compact companion,\nmost likely a stellar-mass black hole. Comparison of abundance data with\npredicted values and a search for a compact companion should provide a\nstringent test of the proposed r-process model. The U-Th age determined by\nCayrel et al. for CS 31082-001 is, to within substantial uncertainties, in\naccord with the r-process age determined from solar system data. The time gap\nbetween Big Bang and onset of normal star formation only allows r-process\nchronometers to provide a lower limit on the age of the universe.",

    "abstract": "We present the results of an extensive mapping survey of 53 `starless' cores\nin the optically thick line of CS 2-1 and the optically thin lines of N2H+ 1-0\nand C18O 1-0. The purpose of this survey was to search for signatures of\nextended inward motions.\n  This study finds 10 `strong' and 9 `probable' infall candidates, based on\n$\\delta V_{CS}$ analysis and on the spectral shapes of CS lines.\n  From our analysis of the blue-skewed CS spectra and the $\\delta V_{CS}$\nparameter, we find typical infall radii of 0.06-0.14 pc. Also, using a simple\ntwo layer radiative transfer model to fit the profiles, we derive\none-dimensional infall speeds, half of whose values lie in the range of\n0.05-0.09 km s$^{-1}$. These values are similar to those found in L1544 by\nTafalla et al., and this result confirms that infall speeds in starless cores\nare generally faster than expected from ambipolar diffusion in a strongly\nsub-critical core. In addition, the observed infall regions are too extended to\nbe consistent with the `inside-out' collapse model applied to a very low-mass\nstar. In the largest cores, the spatial extent of the CS spectra with infall\nasymmetry is larger than the extent of the $\\rm N_2H^+$ core by a factor of\n2-3. All these results suggest that extended inward motions are a common\nfeature in starless cores, and that they could represent a necessary stage in\nthe condensation of a star-forming dense core.",

(1996; 1998). We detected emission in the CS (2-1), N2H+\n(1-0), and HCO+ (1-0) lines. Several clumps of size ~0.08 pc were found for\neach line distributed all over the region where previous single-dish emission\nwas found (Morata et al. 1997). Each molecular transition traces differently\nthe clump distribution, although in some cases the detected clumps are\ncoincident. The distribution of the N2H+ emission and the single-dish NH3\nemission are coincident and compatible with an origin in the same gas. The\nlarge fraction of missing flux measured for the CS (2-1) transition can be\nexplained if the cloud is formed by a clumpy and heterogeneous medium. Four\npositions were selected to derive the abundance ratios [N2H+/CS] and [HCO+/CS]\nfrom the molecular column density determinations, and to compare them with the\nvalues predicted by the chemical model. The model was able to explain the\ninterferometric observations, and, in particular, the chemical differentiation\nof the detected clumps and the coincidence of the NH3 and N2H+ emissions. The\nlack of HCO+ towards the two selected positions that trace the more evolved\nclumps cannot be accounted for by the model, but it is possibly due to strong\nself-absorption. We propose a classification of the studied clumps according to\nthe stage of chemical evolution indicated by the molecular abundances.",

The mass of the CS envelope around SN 1997cy is close to $5\nM_{\\odot}$, while the characteristic time of the ejection of this envelope does\nnot exceed 600 yr. We analyze two possible evolutionary scenarios which might\nlead to the explosion of type Ia supernova inside a dense CS envelope:\naccretion on CO white dwarf in the symbiotic binary and evolution of a single\nstar with the initial mass of about $8 M_{\\odot}$. If the conjecture about the\nexplosion of type Ia supernova in a dense CS envelope is correct in the case of\nSN 2002ic and SN 1997cy then the rapid loss of the red supergiant envelope and\nthe subsequent explosion of the CO white dwarf are synchronized by certain\nmechanism. This mechanism might be related to the contraction of the white\ndwarf as it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit. We show that formation of a\n(super)Chandrasekhar mass due to the merger of a CO white dwarf and CO core of\na red supergiant with consequent explosion is unlikely, since it does not\nprovide the required synchronization of the rapid mass loss and explosion.",

It is very\nabundant in heavy elements (e.g., [La/Fe]=2.2), and its relatively cool\ntemperature and low gravity mean that there are many lines of interesting\nelements present in the spectrum. We measured the abundances of 22 elements\nwith Z>29, including the rarely measured Lu and Pd. We derive an upper limit on\nthe Th abundance as well. The abundances in CS 31062-050 show a similar pattern\nto many other metal-poor CH stars: high [Pb/Fe] and [Pb/La] ratios, low [Y/La]\nratios and high [Eu/La] values compared to the solar system s-process. However,\nthe Th limit, with additional assumptions, is not consistent with the idea that\nthe excess Eu in CS 31062-050 is contributed by the r-process. In addition, the\nobserved [Eu/Tb] cannot be explained by any ratio of solar-system s-process and\nr-process abundances.

The background\nsequence is well modeled as lying in a low dimensional subspace, that can\ngradually change over time, while the moving foreground objects constitute the\ncorrelated sparse outliers. In this and many other applications, the foreground\nis an outlier for PCA but is actually the \"signal of interest\" for the\napplication; where as the background is the corruption or noise. Thus our\nproblem can also be interpreted as one of recursively recovering a time\nsequence of sparse signals in the presence of large but spatially correlated\nnoise.\n  This work has two key contributions. First, we provide a new way of looking\nat this problem and show how a key part of our solution strategy involves\nsolving a noisy compressive sensing (CS) problem. Second, we show how we can\nutilize the correlation of the outliers to our advantage in order to even deal\nwith very large support sized outliers. The main idea is as follows. The\ncorrelation model applied to the previous support estimate helps predict the\ncurrent support. This prediction serves as \"partial support knowledge\" for\nsolving the modified-CS problem instead of CS. The support estimate of the\nmodified-CS reconstruction is, in turn, used to update the correlation model\nparameters using a Kalman filter (or any adaptive filter). We call the\nresulting approach \"support-predicted modified-CS\".",

    "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) is a new approach for the acquisition and recovery\nof sparse signals and images that enables sampling rates significantly below\nthe classical Nyquist rate. Despite significant progress in the theory and\nmethods of CS, little headway has been made in compressive video acquisition\nand recovery. Video CS is complicated by the ephemeral nature of dynamic\nevents, which makes direct extensions of standard CS imaging architectures and\nsignal models difficult. In this paper, we develop a new framework for video CS\nfor dynamic textured scenes that models the evolution of the scene as a linear\ndynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to first\nestimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, and\nthen reconstructing the image frames. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic\nparameters (the state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (the\nobservation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement\nstrategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant and\naccumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. This\nenables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably. We validate\nour approach with a range of experiments involving both video recovery, sensing\nhyper-spectral data, and classification of dynamic scenes from compressive\ndata.

We show that this\ncoupling controls the dominant dynamics in the rattling of these atoms. We\nprovide preliminary evidence that the rattlers couple to each other primarily\nthrough the T2g mode whereas their coupling to the cage modes occurs through\nthe T1u mode. Rattler coupling through the T2g mode provides insight into the\ntrend in spectral broadening from Cs to K. The spectral broadening is inversely\nproportional to the strength of the dynamical correlations on the alkali-metal\nsublattice which in turn depend on the atomic size of the rattler, decreasing\nfrom Cs to K. Thus, the broadest spectrum exhibited by the K is partly a\nconsequence of the small size of this rattler which permits a greater range of\nmotions involving combinations of both correlated and anti-correlated dynamics.\nWe emphasize that the identification of the somewhat distinct roles of the T1u\nand T2g modes in rattler coupling reported in this work is a significant step\ntowards a complete fundamental mechanism of rattler dynamical coupling in these\nosmates.

We investigate properties of the equilibrium curve of the\nflux rope when the CS is present in background multipolar fields. In response\nto the variations at the magnetar surface, it quasi-statically evolves in\nstable equilibrium states. The loss of equilibrium occurs at a critical point\nand, beyond that point, it erupts catastrophically. New features show up when\nthe CS is considered. Especially, we find two kinds of physical behaviors,\ni.e., catastrophic state transition and catastrophic escape. Magnetic energy\nwould be released during state transitions. The released magnetic energy is\nsufficient to drive giant flares. The flux rope would go away from the magnetar\nquasi-statically, which is inconsistent with the radio afterglow. Fortunately,\nin the latter case, i.e., the catastrophic escape, the flux rope could escape\nthe magnetar and go to infinity in a dynamical way. This is more consistent\nwith radio afterglow observations of giant flares. We find that the minor\nradius of flux rope has important implications for its eruption.

Based on this index,\nthe corresponding Bernoulli matrix has been used in CS reconstruction algorithm\nto get back the high-frequency wavelet sub-bands at the decoder. At the\ndecoder, a new Enhanced Approximate Message Passing (EAMP) algorithm has been\nproposed to reconstruct the wavelet coefficients and apply the inverse wavelet\ntransform for restoring back the video frames. Simulation results have\nestablished the superiority of the proposed framework over the existing schemes\nand have increased its suitability for VLSI implementation. Moreover, the coded\nvideo is found to be scalable with an increase in a number of levels of wavelet\ndecomposition.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a switch-based hybrid massive MIMO structure that aims to reduce\nthe hardware complexity and power consumption has been proposed as a potential\ncandidate for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Exploiting the sparse\nnature of the mmWave channel, compressive sensing (CS)-based channel estimators\nhave been proposed. When applied to real mmWave channels, the CS-based channel\nestimators may encounter heavy computational burden due to the high\ndimensionality of the basis. Meanwhile, knowledge about the response of the\nantenna array, which is needed for constructing the basis of the CS estimators,\nmay not be perfect due to array uncertainties such as phase mismatch among\narray elements. This can result in the loss of sparse representation and hence\nthe degraded performance of the CS estimator. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmatrix completion (MC)-based low-complexity channel estimator. The proposed\nscheme is compatible with switch-based hybrid structures, does not need to\nspecify a basis, and can avoid the basis mismatch issue. Compared with the\nexisting CS-based estimator, the proposed basis-free scheme is immune to array\nresponse mismatch and exhibits a significantly lower complexity.",

The optimal projection matrix is obtained by mainly minimizing\nthe average coherence of the equivalent dictionary. In order to drop the\nrequirement of the sparse representation error (SRE) for a set of training data\nas in [15] [16], we introduce a novel penalty function independent of a\nparticular SRE matrix. Without requiring of training data, we can efficiently\ndesign the robust projection matrix and apply it for most of CS systems, like a\nCS system for image processing with a conventional wavelet dictionary in which\nthe SRE matrix is generally not available. Simulation results demonstrate the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Several CS reconstruction models have been proposed and obtained\nsuperior performance. However, these methods suffer from blocking artifacts or\nringing effects at low sampling ratios in most cases. To address this problem,\nwe propose a deep convolutional Laplacian Pyramid Compressed Sensing Network\n(LapCSNet) for CS, which consists of a sampling sub-network and a\nreconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, we utilize a\nconvolutional layer to mimic the sampling operator. In contrast to the fixed\nsampling matrices used in traditional CS methods, the filters used in our\nconvolutional layer are jointly optimized with the reconstruction sub-network.\nIn the reconstruction sub-network, two branches are designed to reconstruct\nmulti-scale residual images and muti-scale target images progressively using a\nLaplacian pyramid architecture. The proposed LapCSNet not only integrates\nmulti-scale information to achieve better performance but also reduces\ncomputational cost dramatically.

The analysis shows that the majority of CS\nscholars tend to make their scholarly debut, publish more papers, and\ncollaborate with more coauthors in conferences than in journals.

Compressive sensing (CS) is a signal processing\ntechnique that allows accurate recovery of a signal from a sampling rate much\nsmaller than the limitation of the Nyquist sampling theorem. The conventional\nCS method is based on the principle that, through a regularized optimization,\nthe sparsity property of the original signals in some domain can be exploited\nto get the exact reconstruction with a high probability.

The\nfrequently used projection matrices in these CS-based source coding schemes\ninclude dense random matrices (e.g., Gaussian matrices or Bernoulli matrices)\nand structured matrices (e.g., Toeplitz matrices). However, these matrices are\neither difficult to be implemented on resource-constrained IoT sensor nodes or\nhave limited applicability. To address these issues, in this paper, we design a\nnovel simple and efficient projection matrix, named sparse Gaussian matrix,\nwhich is easy and resource-saving to be implemented in practical IoT\napplications. We conduct both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation\nof the designed sparse Gaussian matrix. The results demonstrate that employing\nthe designed projection matrix to perform CS-based source coding could\nsignificantly save time and memory cost while ensuring satisfactory signal\nrecovery performance.",

    "abstract": "High angular resolution and sensitive aperture synthesis observations of CS\n($J=2-1$) and CS ($J=3-2$) emissions toward L1551 NE, the second brightest\nprotostar in the Taurus Molecular Cloud, made with the Nobeyama Millimeter\nArray are presented. L1551 NE is categorized as a class 0 object deeply\nembedded in the red-shifted outflow lobe of L1551 IRS 5. Previous studies of\nthe L1551 NE region in CS emission revealed the presence of shell-like\ncomponents open toward L1551 IRS 5, which seem to trace low-velocity shocks in\nthe swept-up shell driven by the outflow from L1551 IRS 5. In this study,\nsignificant CS emission around L1551 NE was detected at the eastern tip of the\nswept-up shell from $V_{\\rm{lsr}}$ = 5.3 km s$^{-1}$ to 10.1 km s$^{-1}$, and\nthe total mass of the dense gas is estimated to be 0.18 $\\pm$ 0.02 $M_\\odot$.\nAdditionally, the following new structures were successfully revealed: a\ncompact disklike component with a size of $\\approx$ 1000 AU just at L1551 NE,\nan arc-shaped structure around L1551 NE, open toward L1551 NE, with a size of\n$\\sim 5000$ AU, i.e., a bow shock, and a distinct velocity gradient of the\ndense gas, i.e., deceleration along the outflow axis of L1551 IRS 5. These\nfeatures suggest that the CS emission traces the post-shocked region where the\ndense gas associated with L1551 NE and the swept-up shell of the outflow from\nL1551 IRS 5 interact. Since the age of L1551 NE is comparable to the timescale\nof the interaction, it is plausible that the formation of L1551 NE was induced\nby the outflow impact. The compact structure of L1551 NE with a tiny envelope\nwas also revealed, suggesting that the outer envelope of L1551 NE has been\nblown off by the outflow from L1551 IRS 5.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the formulation of the non-commutative Chern-Simons (CS)\ntheory where the spatial slice, an infinite strip, is a manifold with\nboundaries. As standard star products are not correct for such manifolds, the\nstandard non-commutative CS theory is not also appropriate here. Instead we\nformulate a new finite-dimensional matrix CS model as an approximation to the\nCS theory on the strip. A work which has points of contact with ours is due to\nLizzi, Vitale and Zampini where the authors obtain a description for the fuzzy\ndisc. The gauge fields in our approach are operators supported on a subspace of\nfinite dimension N+\\eta of the Hilbert space of eigenstates of a simple\nharmonic oscillator with N, \\eta \\in Z^+ and N \\neq 0. This oscillator is\nassociated with the underlying Moyal plane. The resultant matrix CS theory has\na fuzzy edge. It becomes the required sharp edge when N and \\eta goes to\ninfinity in a suitable sense. The non-commutative CS theory on the strip is\ndefined by this limiting procedure. After performing the canonical constraint\nanalysis of the matrix theory, we find that there are edge observables in the\ntheory generating a Lie algebra with properties similar to that of a\nnon-abelian Kac-Moody algebra. Our study shows that there are (\\eta+1)^2\nabelian charges (observables) given by the matrix elements (\\cal A_i)_{N-1 N-1}\nand (\\cal A_i)_{nm} (where n or m \\geq N) of the gauge fields, that obey\ncertain standard canonical commutation relations. In addition, the theory\ncontains three unique non-abelian charges, localized near the N^th level. We\nshow that all non-abelian edge observables except these three can be\nconstructed from the abelian charges above. Using the results of this analysis\nwe discuss the large N and \\eta limit.",

    "title": "Model-Based Compressive Sensing",
    "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) is an alternative to Shannon/Nyquist sampling for\nthe acquisition of sparse or compressible signals that can be well approximated\nby just K << N elements from an N-dimensional basis. Instead of taking periodic\nsamples, CS measures inner products with M < N random vectors and then recovers\nthe signal via a sparsity-seeking optimization or greedy algorithm. Standard CS\ndictates that robust signal recovery is possible from M = O(K log(N/K))\nmeasurements. It is possible to substantially decrease M without sacrificing\nrobustness by leveraging more realistic signal models that go beyond simple\nsparsity and compressibility by including structural dependencies between the\nvalues and locations of the signal coefficients. This paper introduces a\nmodel-based CS theory that parallels the conventional theory and provides\nconcrete guidelines on how to create model-based recovery algorithms with\nprovable performance guarantees. A highlight is the introduction of a new class\nof structured compressible signals along with a new sufficient condition for\nrobust structured compressible signal recovery that we dub the restricted\namplification property, which is the natural counterpart to the restricted\nisometry property of conventional CS. Two examples integrate two relevant\nsignal models - wavelet trees and block sparsity - into two state-of-the-art CS\nrecovery algorithms and prove that they offer robust recovery from just M=O(K)\nmeasurements. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the validity and\napplicability of our new theory and algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The Cold Spot (CS) is a clear feature in the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB); it could be of primordial origin, or caused by a intervening structure\nalong the line of sight. We identified a large projected underdensity in the\nrecently constructed WISE-2MASS all-sky infrared galaxy catalogue aligned with\nthe Cold Spot direction at $(l,b)\\approx(209^\\circ,-57^\\circ)$. It has an\nangular size of tens of degrees, and shows a $\\sim20\\%$ galaxy underdensity in\nthe center. Moreover, we find another large underdensity in the projected\nWISE-2MASS galaxy map at $(l,b)\\approx(101^\\circ,46^\\circ)$ (hereafter Draco\nSupervoid), also aligned with a CMB decrement, although less significant than\nthat of the CS direction. Motivated by these findings, we develop spherically\nsymmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) compensated void models to explain the\nobserved CMB decrements with these two underdensities, or \"supervoids\". Within\nour perturbative treatment of the LTB voids, we find that the Integrated\nSachs-Wolfe and Riess-Sciama effects due to the Draco Supervoid can account for\nthe CMB decrement observed in the same direction. On the contrary, the\nextremely deep CMB decrement in the CS direction is more difficult to explain\nby the presence of the CS supervoid only. Nevertheless, the probability of a\nrandom alignment between the CS and the corresponding supervoid is disfavored,\nand thus its contribution as a secondary anisotropy cannot be neglected. We\ncomment on how the approximations used in this paper, in particular the\nassumption of spherical symmetry, could change quantitatively our conclusions\nand might provide a better explanation for the CMB CS.",

We have performed a cluster analysis of the local\nextrema in the CMB signal to show that the CS is actually associated with a\nlarge group of extrema rather than just one. In the light of this we have\nre-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added \"cleaned\" WCM maps,\nwhich have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the\nsignal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar\nproperties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of\nthe CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian\ntail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we\napply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in\ntwo parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the\nfilter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the\nfilter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the\nsmoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between\ninitial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is\nformed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles\nbetween 10<=L<=20, with a corresponding angular scale about 5-10 degs. This\nsignal leads to modulation of the whole CMB sky, clearly seen at |b|>30deg in\nboth the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature. After\nsubtraction of this modulation, the remaining part of the CMB signal appears to\nbe consistent with statistical homogeneity and Gaussianity.",

    "title": "1-Bit Compressive Sensing: Reformulation and RRSP-Based Sign Recovery\n  Theory",
    "abstract": "Recently, the 1-bit compressive sensing (1-bit CS) has been studied in the\nfield of sparse signal recovery. Since the amplitude information of sparse\nsignals in 1-bit CS is not available, it is often the support or the sign of a\nsignal that can be exactly recovered with a decoding method. In this paper, we\nfirst show that a necessary assumption (that has been overlooked in the\nliterature) should be made for some existing theories and discussions for 1-bit\nCS. Without such an assumption, the found solution by some existing decoding\nalgorithms might be inconsistent with 1-bit measurements. This motivates us to\npursue a new direction to develop uniform and nonuniform recovery theories for\n1-bit CS with a new decoding method which always generates a solution\nconsistent with 1-bit measurements. We focus on an extreme case of 1-bit CS, in\nwhich the measurements capture only the sign of the product of a sensing matrix\nand a signal. We show that the 1-bit CS model can be reformulated equivalently\nas an $\\ell_0$-minimization problem with linear constraints. This reformulation\nnaturally leads to a new linear-program-based decoding method, referred to as\nthe 1-bit basis pursuit, which is remarkably different from existing\nformulations. It turns out that the uniqueness condition for the solution of\nthe 1-bit basis pursuit yields the so-called restricted range space property\n(RRSP) of the transposed sensing matrix. This concept provides a basis to\ndevelop sign recovery conditions for sparse signals through 1-bit measurements.\nWe prove that if the sign of a sparse signal can be exactly recovered from\n1-bit measurements with 1-bit basis pursuit, then the sensing matrix must admit\na certain RRSP, and that if the sensing matrix admits a slightly enhanced RRSP,\nthen the sign of a $k$-sparse signal can be exactly recovered with 1-bit basis\npursuit.",

The 1.2 mm\ncontinuum map reveals, for the first time, a total of 9 compact (r < 0.01pc)\ndust condensations located within a distance of ~0.03 pc from the dissociation\nfront of the PDR. Part of the dust condensations are seen in spectral line\nemissions of CS (5-4) and H$_2$CS ($7_{1,7}$-$6_{1,6}$), though the CS map also\nreveals dense gas further away from the dissociation front. We detect compact\nemissions in H$_2$CS ($6_{0,6}$-$5_{0,5}$), ($6_{2,4}$-$5_{2,3}$) and\nC$^{34}$S, C$^{33}$S (4-3) toward bright dust condensations. The line ratio of\nH$_2$CS ($6_{0,6}$-$5_{0,5}$)/($6_{2,4}$-$5_{2,3}$) suggests a temperature of\n$73\\pm58$ K. A non-thermal velocity dispersion of ~0.25 - 0.50 km s$^{-1}$ is\nderived from the high spectral resolution C$^{34}$S data, and indicates a\nsubsonic to transonic turbulence in the condensations. The masses of the\ncondensations are estimated from the dust emission, and range from 0.03 to 0.3\n$M_{\\odot}$, all significantly lower than any critical mass that is required\nfor self-gravity to play a crucial role. Thus the condensations are not\ngravitationally bound, and could not collapse to form stars. In cooperating\nwith recent high resolution observations of the surface layers of the molecular\ncloud in the Bar, we speculate that the condensations are produced as a\nhigh-pressure wave induced by the expansion of the HII region compresses and\nenters the cloud. A velocity gradient along a direction perpendicular to the\nmajor axis of the Bar is seen in H$_2$CS ($7_{1,7}$-$6_{1,6}$), and is\nconsistent with the scenario that the molecular gas behind the dissociation\nfront is being compressed.",

Until Vc crack dynamics are well\ndescribed by linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). These extreme speeds are\nobtained by suppression of the micro-branching instability, which occurs when\nsample thicknesses are made comparable to the minimum micro-branch width. The\nwavelength of these sinusoidal oscillations is independent of the sample\ndimensions, thereby suggesting that a new intrinsic scale exists that is\nunrelated to LEFM.",

In this paper we study\nthe problem of simultaneously recovering multiple spectrally-sparse signals\nthat are supported on the same frequencies lying arbitrarily on the unit\ncircle. We propose an atomic norm minimization problem, which can be regarded\nas a continuous counterpart of the discrete CS formulation and be solved\nefficiently via semidefinite programming. Through numerical experiments, we\nshow that the number of samples per signal may be further reduced by harnessing\nthe joint sparsity pattern of multiple signals.",

    "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) is an emerging sampling technology that enables\nreconstructing signals from a subset of measurements and even corrupted\nmeasurements. Deep learning-based compressive sensing (DCS) has improved CS\nperformance while maintaining a fast reconstruction but requires a training\nnetwork for each measurement rate. Also, concerning the transmission scheme of\nmeasurement lost, DCS cannot recover the original signal. Thereby, it fails to\nmaintain the error-resilient property. In this work, we proposed a robust deep\nreconstruction network to preserve the error-resilient property under the\nassumption of random measurement lost. Measurement lost layer is proposed to\nsimulate the measurement lost in an end-to-end framework.",

It is found\nthat all these molecular species do not always exhibit the same sense of line\nasymmetry and the correlation of velocity shift is better between HCN and CS\nthan between HCN and H2CO. The most opaque transition of HCN F=2-1 has about\nthe same velocity shift as that of CS despite of the larger beam size of this\nstudy, which suggests that HCN F=2-1 line may be more sensitive to the internal\nmotion of YSOs than CS line. Systematic changes of the velocity shift are noted\nfor many sources, as one goes from F=0-1 to 2-1. The monotonic decrease of\nvelocity (blue shift) is apparently more frequent. A detailed model of\nradiative transfer allowing line overlap of HCN is employed to L483 which shows\nconvincing signatures of infall on a scale of 0.1 pc.

The ejecta are assumed\nto be described by an exponential density profile, following the work of\nDwarkadas & Chevalier (1998). The case of a circumstellar (CS) region formed by\nmass loss from the progenitor or a companion star is also considered. The\ndecelerating contact discontinuity is found to be Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T)\nunstable, as expected, and the nature of the instability is studied in detail\nfor 2 cases: 1) a constant density ambient medium, and 2) a CS medium whose\ndensity goes as r^{-2}. The nature of the instability is found to be different\nin both cases. In the case of a CS medium the instability is much better\nresolved, and a fractal-like structure is seen. In the case of a constant\ndensity medium the extent of growth is less, and the R-T fingers are found to\nbe limited by the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz mushroom caps at the tips of the\nfingers. The unstable region is far enough away from the reverse shock that the\nlatter is not affected by the mixing taking place in the interaction region. In\ncontrast the reverse shock in the case of a CS medium is found to be rippled\ndue to the formation of instabilities. In neither case is the outer shock front\naffected.

From the model we find that CS is detected over a wider radii\nrange than CH3OH. A bipolar outflow is detected in the CS (2-1) line centered\nnear BIMA 1. This outflow could be powered by a yet undetected YSO, BIMA 1W, or\nalternatively could be part of the BIMA 1 molecular outflow. The CS and CH3OH\nemission associated with the intermediate-mass protostar BIMA 2 is highly\nperturbed by the bipolar outflow even at cloud velocities, confirming that the\nprotostar is in a very active stage of mass loss.

Observations of key molecules in the grain\nchemistry such as SiO, CH3OH, SO, CS, H2S, OCS, and SO2 toward this outflow are\npresented. The line profiles and the derived abundances show three distinct\nvelocity regimes that trace the shock evolution: the preshock, the\nshock-precursor and the postshock gas. The SiO, CH3OH, SO, and CS abundances\nare enhanced with respect to the quiescent gas by 1 order of magnitude in the\nshock-precursor component, and by 3 orders of magnitude in the postshock gas.\nThe derived SiO and CH3OH abundances are consistent with the recent ejection of\nthese molecules from grains.

We consider a\nmodel with two exchange constants, $J_1$ and $J_2$ on a lattice that\ninterpolates between the limits of a square-lattice ($J_1=0$), a\ntriangular-lattice ($J_2=J_1$), and decoupled linear chains ($J_2=0$). In all\ncases, the susceptibility which has a Curie-Weiss behavior at high\ntemperatures, rolls over and begins to decrease below a peak temperature,\n$T_p$. Scaling the exchange constants to get the same peak temperature, shows\nthat the susceptibilities for the square-lattice and linear chain limits have\nsimilar magnitudes near the peak. Maximum deviation arises near the\ntriangular-lattice limit, where frustration leads to much smaller\nsusceptibility and with a flatter temperature dependence.

The structural phase transition at $T_{\\rm s}$ is characterized as an\norder-disorder transition of Cu$^{2+}$ orbitals.",

A new field of interest based on\nsparsity has recently emerged: compressed sensing. This theory is a new\nsampling framework that provides an alternative to the well-known Shannon\nsampling theory. In this paper we investigate how compressed sensing (CS) can\nprovide new insights into astronomical data compression and more generally how\nit paves the way for new conceptions in astronomical remote sensing. We first\ngive a brief overview of the compressed sensing theory which provides very\nsimple coding process with low computational cost, thus favoring its use for\nreal-time applications often found on board space mission. We introduce a\npractical and effective recovery algorithm for decoding compressed data. In\nastronomy, physical prior information is often crucial for devising effective\nsignal processing methods. We particularly point out that a CS-based\ncompression scheme is flexible enough to account for such information. In this\ncontext, compressed sensing is a new framework in which data acquisition and\ndata processing are merged. We show also that CS provides a new fantastic way\nto handle multiple observations of the same field view, allowing us to recover\ninformation at very low signal-to-noise ratio, which is impossible with\nstandard compression methods. This CS data fusion concept could lead to an\nelegant and effective way to solve the problem ESA is faced with, for the\ntransmission to the earth of the data collected by PACS, one of the instruments\non board the Herschel spacecraft which will be launched in 2008.",

The orientation polarization of polar molecule, such as HCl or\nH2O etc, is a molecule as a whole turned toward the direction of an external\nfield. Unlike polar molecules, the orientation polarization of polar atom, such\nas K, Rb or Cs atom, is only the valence electron in the outermost shell, along\na highly elliptical orbit, turned toward the direction of the field, but the\nrest of the atom does not move! The article derived the new form of Boltzmann\nconstant.

    "abstract": "This paper describes performance bounds for compressed sensing (CS) where the\nunderlying sparse or compressible (sparsely approximable) signal is a vector of\nnonnegative intensities whose measurements are corrupted by Poisson noise. In\nthis setting, standard CS techniques cannot be applied directly for several\nreasons. First, the usual signal-independent and/or bounded noise models do not\napply to Poisson noise, which is non-additive and signal-dependent. Second, the\nCS matrices typically considered are not feasible in real optical systems\nbecause they do not adhere to important constraints, such as nonnegativity and\nphoton flux preservation. Third, the typical $\\ell_2$--$\\ell_1$ minimization\nleads to overfitting in the high-intensity regions and oversmoothing in the\nlow-intensity areas. In this paper, we describe how a feasible positivity- and\nflux-preserving sensing matrix can be constructed, and then analyze the\nperformance of a CS reconstruction approach for Poisson data that minimizes an\nobjective function consisting of a negative Poisson log likelihood term and a\npenalty term which measures signal sparsity. We show that, as the overall\nintensity of the underlying signal increases, an upper bound on the\nreconstruction error decays at an appropriate rate (depending on the\ncompressibility of the signal), but that for a fixed signal intensity, the\nsignal-dependent part of the error bound actually grows with the number of\nmeasurements or sensors.

For a phase shift of pi/2\nbetween scattered and unscattered electrons induced by a physical phase plate,\nthe sine-type phase contrast transfer function is converted into a cosine-type\nfunction. Optimal imaging conditions could theoretically be achieved if the\nphase shifts caused by the objective lens defocus and lens aberrations would be\nequal zero. In reality this situation is difficult to realize because of\nresidual aberrations and varying, non-zero local defocus values, which in\ngeneral result from an uneven sample surface topography. We explore the\nconditions - i.e. range of Cs-values and defocus - for most favourable contrast\ntransfer as a function of the information limit, which is only limited by the\neffect of partial coherence of the electron wave in Cs-corrected transmission\nelectron microscopes. Under high-resolution operation conditions we find that a\nphysical phase plate improves strongly low- and medium-resolution object\ncontrast, while improving tolerance to defocus and Cs-variations, compared to a\nmicroscope without a phase plate.",

    "abstract": "We present a map of the spiral structure of the Galaxy, as traced by\nmolecular CS emission associated with IRAS sources which are believed to be\ncompact HII regions. The CS line velocities are used to determine the kinematic\ndistances of the sources, in order to investigate their distribution in the\ngalactic plane. This allows us to use 870 objects to trace the arms, a number\nlarger than that of previous studies based on classical HII regions. The\ndistance ambiguity of the kinematic distances, when it exists, is solved by\ndifferent procedures, including the latitude distribution and an analysis of\nthe longitude-velocity diagram. The well defined spiral arms are seen to be\nconfined inside the co-rotation radius, as is often the case in spiral\ngalaxies. We identify a square-shaped sub-structure in the CS map with that\npredicted by stellar orbits at the 4:1 resonance (4 epicycle oscillations in\none turn around the galactic center). The sub-structure is found at the\nexpected radius, based on the known pattern rotation speed and epicycle\nfrequency curve. An inner arm presents an end with strong inward curvature and\nintense star formation that we tentatively associate with the region where this\narm surrounds the extremity of the bar, as seen in many barred galaxies.\nFinally, a new arm with concave curvature is found in the Sagitta to Cepheus\nregion of the sky.",

    "abstract": "A novel framework of compressed sensing, namely statistical compressed\nsensing (SCS), that aims at efficiently sampling a collection of signals that\nfollow a statistical distribution, and achieving accurate reconstruction on\naverage, is introduced. SCS based on Gaussian models is investigated in depth.\nFor signals that follow a single Gaussian model, with Gaussian or Bernoulli\nsensing matrices of O(k) measurements, considerably smaller than the O(k\nlog(N/k)) required by conventional CS based on sparse models, where N is the\nsignal dimension, and with an optimal decoder implemented via linear filtering,\nsignificantly faster than the pursuit decoders applied in conventional CS, the\nerror of SCS is shown tightly upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term\napproximation error, with overwhelming probability. The failure probability is\nalso significantly smaller than that of conventional sparsity-oriented CS.\nStronger yet simpler results further show that for any sensing matrix, the\nerror of Gaussian SCS is upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term\napproximation with probability one, and the bound constant can be efficiently\ncalculated. For Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), that assume multiple Gaussian\ndistributions and that each signal follows one of them with an unknown index, a\npiecewise linear estimator is introduced to decode SCS. The accuracy of model\nselection, at the heart of the piecewise linear decoder, is analyzed in terms\nof the properties of the Gaussian distributions and the number of sensing\nmeasurements. A maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization algorithm that\niteratively estimates the Gaussian models parameters, the signals model\nselection, and decodes the signals, is presented for GMM-based SCS. In real\nimage sensing applications, GMM-based SCS is shown to lead to improved results\ncompared to conventional CS, at a considerably lower computational cost.",

Exciting applications ranging from\nneuroscience to genome-wide association analysis build on these models with the\nadditional requirement of parsimony. This requirement has high interpretative\nvalue, but unfortunately cannot be met by least-squares based or kernel\nregression methods. To this end, compressed sampling (CS) approaches, already\nsuccessful in linear regression settings, can offer a viable alternative. The\nviability of CS for sparse Volterra and polynomial models is the core theme of\nthis work. A common sparse regression task is initially posed for the two\nmodels. Building on (weighted) Lasso-based schemes, an adaptive RLS-type\nalgorithm is developed for sparse polynomial regressions. The identifiability\nof polynomial models is critically challenged by dimensionality.

To quantify the sufficient number of\nmeasurements for a given level of sparsity, restricted isometry properties\n(RIP) are investigated in commonly met polynomial regression settings,\ngeneralizing known results for their linear counterparts.

CS exploits the signal's sparsity or compressibility in a\nparticular domain and integrates data compression and acquisition, thus\nallowing exact reconstruction through relatively few non-adaptive linear\nmeasurements. While conventional CS theory relies on data representation in the\nform of vectors, many data types in various applications such as color imaging,\nvideo sequences, and multi-sensor networks, are intrinsically represented by\nhigher-order tensors. Application of CS to higher-order data representation is\ntypically performed by conversion of the data to very long vectors that must be\nmeasured using very large sampling matrices, thus imposing a huge computational\nand memory burden. In this paper, we propose Generalized Tensor Compressive\nSensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for compressive sensing of higher-order\ntensors which preserves the intrinsic structure of tensor data with reduced\ncomputational complexity at reconstruction. GTCS offers an efficient means for\nrepresentation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition\nand compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we propound two\nreconstruction procedures, a serial method (GTCS-S) and a parallelizable method\n(GTCS-P). We then compare the performance of the proposed method with Kronecker\ncompressive sensing (KCS) and multi way compressive sensing (MWCS). We\ndemonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS and MWCS in terms of both\nreconstruction accuracy (within a range of compression ratios) and processing\nspeed.

The X-ray data show a\nlong-lasting extended source that is rising upwards, toward the\nhigh-temperature source detected by UVCS. UVCS data show the presence of\nsignificant non-thermal broadening in the CS (signature of turbulent motions)\nand a strong density gradient across the CS region. The thermal energy released\nin the HXR source is on the order of about 10^32 erg, a factor about 2-5 larger\nthan the energy required to explain the high-temperature plasma sampled by\nUVCS. Nevertheless, the very different time evolutions of SXR and HXR sources\ncompared to the UV emission suggest that reconnection occurring above the\npost-eruption arcades are not directly responsible for the high-temperature\nplasma sampled higher up by UVCS.

    "abstract": "Ultra low radiation dose in X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is an important\nclinical objective in order to minimize the risk of carcinogenesis. Compressed\nSensing (CS) enables significant reductions in radiation dose to be achieved by\nproducing diagnostic images from a limited number of CT projections. However,\nthe excessive computation time that conventional CS-based CT reconstruction\ntypically requires has limited clinical implementation. In this paper, we first\ndemonstrate that a thorough analysis of CT reconstruction through a Maximum a\nPosteriori objective function results in a weighted compressive sensing\nproblem. This analysis enables us to formulate a low dose fan beam and helical\ncone beam CT reconstruction. Subsequently, we provide an efficient solution to\nthe formulated CS problem based on a Fast Composite Splitting Algorithm-Latent\nExpected Maximization (FCSA-LEM) algorithm. In the proposed method we use\npseudo polar Fourier transform as the measurement matrix in order to decrease\nthe computational complexity; and rebinning of the projections to parallel rays\nin order to extend its application to fan beam and helical cone beam scans. The\nweight involved in the proposed weighted CS model, denoted by Error Adaptation\nWeight (EAW), is calculated based on the statistical characteristics of CT\nreconstruction and is a function of Poisson measurement noise and rebinning\ninterpolation error. Simulation results show that low computational complexity\nof the proposed method made the fast recovery of the CT images possible and\nusing EAW reduces the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude. Recovery\nof a high quality 512$\\times$ 512 image was achieved in less than 20 sec on a\ndesktop computer without numerical optimizations.",

    "abstract": "Spatial multiplexing cameras (SMCs) acquire a (typically static) scene\nthrough a series of coded projections using a spatial light modulator (e.g., a\ndigital micro-mirror device) and a few optical sensors. This approach finds use\nin imaging applications where full-frame sensors are either too expensive\n(e.g., for short-wave infrared wavelengths) or unavailable. Existing SMC\nsystems reconstruct static scenes using techniques from compressive sensing\n(CS). For videos, however, existing acquisition and recovery methods deliver\npoor quality. In this paper, we propose the CS multi-scale video (CS-MUVI)\nsensing and recovery framework for high-quality video acquisition and recovery\nusing SMCs. Our framework features novel sensing matrices that enable the\nefficient computation of a low-resolution video preview, while enabling\nhigh-resolution video recovery using convex optimization. To further improve\nthe quality of the reconstructed videos, we extract optical-flow estimates from\nthe low-resolution previews and impose them as constraints in the recovery\nprocedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our CS-MUVI framework for a host of\nsynthetic and real measured SMC video data, and we show that high-quality\nvideos can be recovered at roughly $60\\times$ compression.",

Here, we explore the alternative possibility that such large-scale\nmotions are themselves self-sustained and do not draw their energy from\nsmaller-scale turbulent motions activated in buffer layers. To this end, it is\nfirst shown that large-scale motions in turbulent Couette flow at Re=2150\nself-sustain even when active processes at smaller scales are artificially\nquenched by increasing the Smagorinsky constant Cs in large eddy simulations.\nThese results are in agreement with earlier results on pressure driven\nturbulent channels. We further investigate the nature of the large-scale\ncoherent motions by computing upper and lower-branch nonlinear steady solutions\nof the filtered (LES) equations with a Newton-Krylov solver,and find that they\nare connected by a saddle-node bifurcation at large values of Cs. Upper branch\nsolutions for the filtered large scale motions are computed for Reynolds\nnumbers up to Re=2187 using specific paths in the Re-Cs parameter plane and\ncompared to large-scale coherent motions. Continuation to Cs = 0 reveals that\nthese large-scale steady solutions of the filtered equations are connected to\nthe Nagata-Clever-Busse-Waleffe branch of steady solutions of the Navier-Stokes\nequations.

In CS-MRI,\nthe randomly under-sampled Fourier matrix is used as the measurement matrix and\nthe wavelet transform is usually used as sparsifying transform matrix.

This novel encoding scheme\nis combined with the multichannel compressive sensing (MCS) framework to take\nthe advantage of multichannel data acquisition used in MRI scanners. An\nempirical RIP analysis is presented to compare the multichannel noiselet and\nmultichannel Fourier measurement matrices in MCS.

An analysis that is relied on\ntwo fundamental CS principles; the Uniform Random Sampling (URS) and the\nUncertainty Principle (UP), is presented. We show that CS on a single- and\nmulti-band signals performs better if the URS is done only within the band and\nsuppress the out-band parts, compared to ordinary URS that ignore the band\nlimits. It means that sampling should only be done at the signal support, while\nthe non-support should be masked and suppressed in the reconstruction process.\nWe also show that for an N-length discrete time signal with K-number of\nfrequency components (Fourier coefficients), given the knowledge of the\nspectrum, URS leads to exact sampling on the location of the K-spectral peaks.\nThese results are used to formulate a sampling scheme when the boundaries of\nthe bands are not sharply distinguishable, such as in a triangular- or a\nstacked-band- spectral signals. When analyzing these cases, CS will face a\nparadox; in which narrowing the band leads to a more number of required\nsamples, whereas widening it leads to lessen the number. Accordingly; instead\nof signal analysis by dividing the signal's spectrum vertically into bands of\nfrequencies, slicing horizontally magnitude-wise yields less number of required\nsample and better reconstruction results. Moreover, it enables sample reuse\nthat reduces the sample number even further. The horizontal slicing and sample\nreuse methods imply non-uniform random sampling, where larger-magnitude part of\nthe spectrum should be allocated more sample than the lower ones.",

    "title": "Compressed Sensing for Implantable Neural Recordings Using Co-sparse\n  Analysis Model and Weighted $\\ell_1$-Optimization",
    "abstract": "Reliable and energy-efficient wireless data transmission remains a major\nchallenge in resource-constrained wireless neural recording tasks, where data\ncompression is generally adopted to relax the burdens on the wireless data\nlink. Recently, Compressed Sensing (CS) theory has successfully demonstrated\nits potential in neural recording application. The main limitation of CS,\nhowever, is that the neural signals have no good sparse representation with\ncommonly used dictionaries and learning a reliable dictionary is often data\ndependent and computationally demanding. In this paper, a novel CS approach for\nimplantable neural recording is proposed. The main contributions are: 1) The\nco-sparse analysis model is adopted to enforce co-sparsity of the neural\nsignals, therefore overcoming the drawbacks of conventional synthesis model and\nenhancing the reconstruction performance. 2) A multi-fractional-order\ndifference matrix is constructed as the analysis dictionary, thus avoiding the\ndictionary learning procedure and reducing the need for previously acquired\ndata and computational resources. 3) By exploiting the statistical priors of\nthe analysis coefficients, a weighted analysis $\\ell_1$-minimization (WALM)\nalgorithm is proposed to reconstruct the neural signals. Experimental results\non Leicester neural signal database reveal that the proposed approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art CS-based methods. On the challenging high\ncompression ratio task, the proposed approach still achieves high\nreconstruction performance and spike classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction is a severely ill-posed linear\ninverse task demanding time and resource intensive computations that can\nsubstantially trade off {\\it accuracy} for {\\it speed} in real-time imaging. In\naddition, state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS) analytics are not cognizant\nof the image {\\it diagnostic quality}. To cope with these challenges we put\nforth a novel CS framework that permeates benefits from generative adversarial\nnetworks (GAN) to train a (low-dimensional) manifold of diagnostic-quality MR\nimages from historical patients. Leveraging a mixture of least-squares (LS)\nGANs and pixel-wise $\\ell_1$ cost, a deep residual network with skip\nconnections is trained as the generator that learns to remove the {\\it\naliasing} artifacts by projecting onto the manifold. LSGAN learns the texture\ndetails, while $\\ell_1$ controls the high-frequency noise. A multilayer\nconvolutional neural network is then jointly trained based on diagnostic\nquality images to discriminate the projection quality. The test phase performs\nfeed-forward propagation over the generator network that demands a very low\ncomputational overhead. Extensive evaluations are performed on a large\ncontrast-enhanced MR dataset of pediatric patients. In particular, images rated\nbased on expert radiologists corroborate that GANCS retrieves high contrast\nimages with detailed texture relative to conventional CS, and pixel-wise\nschemes. In addition, it offers reconstruction under a few milliseconds, two\norders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art CS-MRI schemes.",

Moreover, we study the effect\nof a finite boson-boson interaction to the spectrum. Taking the realistic\nsystem of Li impurities immersed in Cs bosons with a positive Cs-Cs scattering\nlength, we find a visible Efimov branch, which is associated with the second\nlowest Efimov trimer, in the polaron spectrum.

    "abstract": "Compressed Sensing MRI (CS-MRI) has provided theoretical foundations upon\nwhich the time-consuming MRI acquisition process can be accelerated. However,\nit primarily relies on iterative numerical solvers which still hinders their\nadaptation in time-critical applications. In addition, recent advances in deep\nneural networks have shown their potential in computer vision and image\nprocessing, but their adaptation to MRI reconstruction is still in an early\nstage. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based generative\nadversarial model, RefineGAN, for fast and accurate CS-MRI reconstruction. The\nproposed model is a variant of fully-residual convolutional autoencoder and\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically designed for CS-MRI\nformulation; it employs deeper generator and discriminator networks with cyclic\ndata consistency loss for faithful interpolation in the given under-sampled\nk-space data. In addition, our solution leverages a chained network to further\nenhance the reconstruction quality. RefineGAN is fast and accurate -- the\nreconstruction process is extremely rapid, as low as tens of milliseconds for\nreconstruction of a 256x256 image, because it is one-way deployment on a\nfeed-forward network, and the image quality is superior even for extremely low\nsampling rate (as low as 10%) due to the data-driven nature of the method. We\ndemonstrate that RefineGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art CS-MRI methods by a\nlarge margin in terms of both running time and image quality via evaluation\nusing several open-source MRI databases.",

In\naddition to the selection of source material with desired density of\nstates-energy relation (D(E)), engineering the source: channel interface for\ngate-tunable channel-barrier is crucial to a CS-FET. However, conventional\nmetal: semiconductor (MS)-interfaces generally suffer from strong\nFermi-level-pinning due to the inevitable chemical disorder and defect-induced\ngap states, precluding the gate-tunability of the barriers. By comprehensive\nmaterials and device modeling at the atomic-scale, we report that the\ntwo-dimensional (2D)-van der Waals (vdW)-MS-interfaces, with their atomic\nsharpness and cleanness, can be considered as general ingredients for CS-FETs.\nAs test cases, InSe-based n-type FETs are studied. It is found that graphene\ncan be spontaneously p-type doped along with slightly opened bandgap around the\nDirac-point by interfacing with InSe, resulting in super-exponentially decaying\nhot carrier density with increasing n-type channel-barrier. Moreover, the D(E)\nrelations suggest that 2D-transition-metal-dichalcogenides and\n2D-transition-metal-carbides are rich libraries of CS materials. Both graphene\nand H-TaTe2 CSs lead to subthreshold swing below 60 mV/decade. This work\nbroadens the application potentials of 2D-vdW-MS-heterostructures and serves as\na springboard for more studies on low-power electronics based on 2D materials.",

A major challenge for CS-MRI lies in solving the severely ill-posed\ninverse problem to reconstruct aliasing-free MR images from the sparse k-space\ndata. Conventional methods typically optimize an energy function, producing\nreconstruction of high quality, but their iterative numerical solvers\nunavoidably bring extremely slow processing. Recent data-driven techniques are\nable to provide fast restoration by either learning direct prediction to final\nreconstruction or plugging learned modules into the energy optimizer.\nNevertheless, these data-driven predictors cannot guarantee the reconstruction\nfollowing constraints underlying the regularizers of conventional methods so\nthat the reliability of their reconstruction results are questionable. In this\npaper, we propose a converged deep framework assembling principled modules for\nCS-MRI that fuses learning strategy with the iterative solver of a conventional\nreconstruction energy.

Although state-of-the-art deep learning based\nmethods have been able to obtain fast, high-quality reconstruction of CS-MR\nimages, their main drawback is that they treat complex-valued MRI data as\nreal-valued entities. Most methods either extract the magnitude from the\ncomplex-valued entities or concatenate them as two real-valued channels. In\nboth the cases, the phase content, which links the real and imaginary parts of\nthe complex-valued entities, is discarded. In order to address the fundamental\nproblem of real-valued deep networks, i.e. their inability to process\ncomplex-valued data, we propose a novel framework based on a complex-valued\ngenerative adversarial network (Co-VeGAN). Our model can process complex-valued\ninput, which enables it to perform high-quality reconstruction of the CS-MR\nimages. Further, considering that phase is a crucial component of\ncomplex-valued entities, we propose a novel complex-valued activation function,\nwhich is sensitive to the phase of the input. Extensive evaluation of the\nproposed approach on different datasets using various sampling masks\ndemonstrates that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing\nCS-MRI reconstruction techniques in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio as well\nas structural similarity index.

Using either approach alone usually limits\nperformance and generalizability in image restoration tasks.

    "title": "The Competing Effect of Initial Crack Depth Versus Chemical\n  Strengthening Parameters on Apparent Fracture Toughness of Sodium\n  Aluminosilicate Glass",
    "abstract": "The widespread use of sodium aluminosilicate glass in many engineering\napplications due to its mechanical and optical properties (transparency,\ndielectric, etc.), has become common in recent years. However, glass, a brittle\nmaterial, has its vulnerability to fracture. Processes such as heat treatment\n(heat tempering) or chemical strengthening through ion-exchange have been used\nto create residual stress profiles on the glass, in a bid to improve its\nfracture strength. However, failure still occurs, which is mostly catastrophic\nand expensive to repair. Therefore understanding, predicting, and eventually\nimproving the resistance to damage or fracture of chemically strengthened glass\nis important to designing new glasses that would be tougher while retaining\ntheir transparency. The relationship between the glass residual stress\nparameters such as the compressive stress (CS), depth of compression layer\n(DOL), and central tension (CT) versus apparent (effective) fracture toughness\nfor different crack depth was investigated in this study using a Silicon\nCarbide particle blast plus ring-on-ring (RoR) test method. The results also\nshowed that improving the fracture resistance of glass via chemical\nstrengthening requires a proper combination of CS, DOL, and CT, which is\nparticularly dependent on the initial/existing crack (flaw) depth. It was\ndetermined that for a damage event involving the introduction of a shallow\ncrack depth, the criterion for optimal resistance to fracture, in terms of\napparent fracture toughness, is weighted more towards a high CS, than deep DOL\nwhile for a deep flaw damage event, it is more weighted towards deep DOL, than\na high CS. These results provide a valuable piece of information in the design\nof a more robust glass in engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To allow efficient learning using the Recurrent Inference Machine\n(RIM) for image reconstruction whereas not being strictly dependent on the\ntraining data distribution so that unseen modalities and pathologies are still\naccurately recovered. Methods: Theoretically, the RIM learns to solve the\ninverse problem of accelerated-MRI reconstruction whereas being robust to\nvariable imaging conditions. The efficiency and generalization capabilities\nwith different training datasets were studied, as well as recurrent network\nunits with decreasing complexity: the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), the Minimal\nGated Unit (MGU), and the Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN), to\nreduce inference times. Validation was performed against Compressed Sensing\n(CS) and further assessed based on data unseen during training. A pathology\nstudy was conducted by reconstructing simulated white matter lesions and\nprospectively undersampled data of a Multiple Sclerosis patient. Results:\nTraining on a single modality of 3T $T_1$-weighted brain data appeared\nsufficient to also reconstruct 7T $T_{2}^*$-weighted brain and 3T\n$T_2$-weighted knee data. The IndRNN is an efficient recurrent unit, reducing\ninference time by 68\\% compared to CS, whereas maintaining performance. The RIM\nwas able to reconstruct lesions unseen during training more accurately than CS\nwhen trained on $T_2$-weighted knee data.

    "abstract": "Quantum devices can be used to solve constrained combinatorial optimization\n(COPT) problems thanks to the use of penalization methods to embed the COPT\nproblem's constraints in its objective to obtain a quadratic unconstrained\nbinary optimization (QUBO) reformulation of the COPT. However, the particular\nway in which this penalization is carried out, affects the value of the penalty\nparameters, as well as the number of additional binary variables that are\nneeded to obtain the desired QUBO reformulation. In turn, these factors\nsubstantially affect the ability of quantum computers to efficiently solve\nthese constrained COPT problems. This efficiency is key towards the goal of\nusing quantum computers to solve constrained COPT problems more efficiently\nthan with classical computers. Along these lines, we consider an important\nconstrained COPT problem; namely, the maximum $k$-colorable subgraph (M$k$CS)\nproblem, in which the aim is to find an induced $k$-colorable subgraph with\nmaximum cardinality in a given graph. This problem arises in channel assignment\nin spectrum sharing networks, VLSI design, human genetic research, and\ncybersecurity. We derive two QUBO reformulations for the M$k$CS problem, and\nfully characterize the range of the penalty parameters that can be used in the\nQUBO reformulations. Further, one of the QUBO reformulations of the M$k$CS\nproblem is obtained without the need to introduce additional binary variables.\nTo illustrate the benefits of obtaining and characterizing these QUBO\nreformulations, we benchmark different QUBO reformulations of the M$k$CS\nproblem by performing numerical tests on D-Wave's quantum annealing devices.\nThese tests also illustrate the numerical power gained by using the latest\nD-Wave's quantum annealing device.",

    "abstract": "Compressed sensing (CS) involves sampling signals at rates less than their\nNyquist rates and attempting to reconstruct them after sample acquisition. Most\nsuch algorithms have parameters, for example the regularization parameter in\nLASSO, which need to be chosen carefully for optimal performance. These\nparameters can be chosen based on assumptions on the noise level or signal\nsparsity, but this knowledge may often be unavailable. In such cases, cross\nvalidation (CV) can be used to choose these parameters in a purely data-driven\nfashion. Previous work analysing the use of CV in CS has been based on the\n$\\ell_2$ cross-validation error with Gaussian measurement noise. But it is well\nknown that the $\\ell_2$ error is not robust to impulse noise and provides a\npoor estimate of the recovery error, failing to choose the best parameter. Here\nwe propose using the $\\ell_1$ CV error which provides substantial performance\nbenefits given impulse measurement noise. Most importantly, we provide a\ndetailed theoretical analysis and error bounds for the use of $\\ell_1$ CV error\nin CS reconstruction. We show that with high probability, choosing the\nparameter that yields the minimum $\\ell_1$ CV error is equivalent to choosing\nthe minimum recovery error (which is not observable in practice).

Methods: A residual U-net and our U-net M were used to generate the\nhigh resolution x-f space estimate for k-t SENSE regularisation prior. The\nnetworks were judged on their ability to generalise to real undersampled data.\nThe in-vivo validation was done on 20 real-time 18x prospectively undersmapled\nGASperturbed PCMR data. The ML aided k-t SENSE reconstruction results were\ncompared against the free-breathing Cartesian retrospectively gated sequence\nand the compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction of the same data. Results: In\ngeneral, the ML aided k-t SENSE generated flow curves that were visually\nsharper than those produced using CS.

    "abstract": "Carbon disulfide, CS$_2$, is an archetypal double-bonded molecular system\nbelonging to the rich class of group IV-group VI, AB$_2$ compounds. It is\nwidely and since long time believed that upon compression at several GPa a\npolymeric chain of type (-(C=S)-S-)$_n$ named Bridgman's black polymer will\nform. By combining optical spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction data\nwith ab initio simulations, we demonstrate that the structure of the Bridgman's\nblack polymer is remarkably different. Solid molecular CS$_2$ undergoes a\npressure-induced structural transformation at around 10-11 GPa, developing a\ndisordered polymeric system. The polymer consists of 3-fold and 4-fold\ncoordinated carbon atoms with an average carbon coordination continuously\nincreasing upon further compression to 40 GPa. Polymerization also gives rise\nto some C=C double bonds. Upon decompression, the structural changes are\npartially reverted, a very small amount of molecular CS$_2$ is recovered, while\nthe sample undergoes partial chemical disproportionation.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for single-pixel imaging via\ncompressive sensing (CS) in shift-invariant (SI) spaces by exploiting the\nsparsity property of a wavelet representation. We reinterpret the acquisition\nprocedure of a single-pixel camera as filtering of the observed signal with\ncontinuous-domain functions that lie in an SI subspace spanned by the integer\nshifts of the box function. The signal is modeled by an arbitrary SI generator\nwhose special case is the box function, which, as we show in the paper, is\nconventionally used in single-pixel imaging. We propose to use separable\nB-spline generators which are intuitively complemented by sparsity-inducing\nspline wavelets. The SI models of the acquisition and the underlying signal\nlead to an exact discretization of an inherently continuous-domain inverse\nproblem to a finite-dimensional problem of CS type. By solving the CS\noptimization problem, a parametric representation of the signal is obtained.\nSuch a representation offers many practical advantages in image processing\napplications. We propose an efficient matrix-free implementation of the\nframework and conduct it on the standard test images and real-world measurement\ndata.

    "abstract": "It is assumed that HXR sources map to the primary energy release site in\nflares where particle acceleration occurs. Strong HXR sources are mostly\nobserved at confined regions along the reconnecting magnetic arcade. We make a\ngeneral approach on how the geometry of the reconnecting current sheet (CS) may\ninfluence the strength and localization of observed HXR sources. For this we\nuse results from an analysis on the 3B/X3.8 flare on January 17, 2005 (Temmer\net al., 2007), as well as measurements from the associated CME. Due to the\nclose match of the CME acceleration profile and the flare HXR flux, we suppose\nthat the CME might play a certain role in modifying the geometry of the CS\n('symmetric' versus 'asymmetric' vertically stretched CS). This could be the\ndriver for 'guiding' the accelerated particles to confined areas along the\nflaring arcade and might explain the spatially limited occurrence of strong HXR\nsources in comparison to elongated ribbons as seen in H-alpha and UV.",

    "abstract": "This work calls into question a substantial body of past work on CSMA\nwireless networks. In the majority of studies on CSMA wireless networks, a\ncontention graph is used to model the carrier sensing relationships (CS) among\nlinks. This is a 0-1 model in which two links can either sense each other\ncompletely or not. In real experiments, we observed that this is generally not\nthe case: the CS relationship between the links are often probabilistic and can\nvary dynamically over time. This is the case even if the distance between the\nlinks is fixed and there is no drastic change in the environment. Furthermore,\nthis partial carrier sensing relationship is prevalent and occurs over a wide\nrange of distances between the links. This observation is not consistent with\nthe 0-1 contention graph and implies that many results and conclusions drawn\nfrom previous theoretical studies need to be re-examined. This paper\nestablishes a more accurate CS model with the objective of laying down a\nfoundation for future theoretical studies that reflect reality. Towards that\nend, we set up detailed experiments to investigate the partial carrier sensing\nphenomenon.

    "abstract": "A field known as Compressive Sensing (CS) has recently emerged to help\naddress the growing challenges of capturing and processing high-dimensional\nsignals and data sets. CS exploits the surprising fact that the information\ncontained in a sparse signal can be preserved in a small number of compressive\n(or random) linear measurements of that signal. Strong theoretical guarantees\nhave been established on the accuracy to which sparse or near-sparse signals\ncan be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address\nsimilar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of\nsparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise\nin both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Building upon recent\nresults concerning the stable embeddings of manifolds within the measurement\nspace, we establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal\nbounds in $\\ell_2$ for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation\nfrom noisy compressive measurements. In line with analogous results for\nsparsity-based CS, we conclude that much stronger bounds are possible in the\nprobabilistic setting. Our work supports the growing empirical evidence that\nmanifold-based models can be used with high accuracy in compressive signal\nprocessing.",

    "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) has recently emerged as a framework for efficiently\ncapturing signals that are sparse or compressible in an appropriate basis.\nWhile often motivated as an alternative to Nyquist-rate sampling, there remains\na gap between the discrete, finite-dimensional CS framework and the problem of\nacquiring a continuous-time signal. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this\ngap by exploiting the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's), a\ncollection of functions that trace back to the seminal work by Slepian, Landau,\nand Pollack on the effects of time-limiting and bandlimiting operations. DPSS's\nform a highly efficient basis for sampled bandlimited functions; by modulating\nand merging DPSS bases, we obtain a dictionary that offers high-quality sparse\napproximations for most sampled multiband signals. This multiband modulated\nDPSS dictionary can be readily incorporated into the CS framework. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees and practical insight into the use of this dictionary\nfor recovery of sampled multiband signals from compressive measurements.",

The main contribution of this paper is to allow\n\\textit{deterministic} tracking of time varying supports with multiple\nmeasurement vectors (MMV) by exploiting multi-sensor diversity.

    "abstract": "The recently introduced compressive sensing (CS) framework enables digital\nsignal acquisition systems to take advantage of signal structures beyond\nbandlimitedness. Indeed, the number of CS measurements required for stable\nreconstruction is closer to the order of the signal complexity than the Nyquist\nrate. To date, the CS theory has focused on real-valued measurements, but in\npractice, measurements are mapped to bits from a finite alphabet. Moreover, in\nmany potential applications the total number of measurement bits is\nconstrained, which suggests a tradeoff between the number of measurements and\nthe number of bits per measurement. We study this situation in this paper and\nshow that there exist two distinct regimes of operation that correspond to\nhigh/low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the measurement compression (MC)\nregime, a high SNR favors acquiring fewer measurements with more bits per\nmeasurement; in the quantization compression (QC) regime, a low SNR favors\nacquiring more measurements with fewer bits per measurement. A surprise from\nour analysis and experiments is that in many practical applications it is\nbetter to operate in the QC regime, even acquiring as few as 1 bit per\nmeasurement.",

    "abstract": "Multilook processing is a widely used speckle reduction approach in synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) imaging. Conventionally, it is achieved by incoherently\nsumming of some independent low-resolution images formulated from overlapping\nsubbands of the SAR signal. However, in the context of compressive sensing (CS)\nSAR imaging, where the samples are collected at sub-Nyquist rate, the data\nspectrum is highly aliased that hinders the direct application of the existing\nmultilook techniques. In this letter, we propose a new CS-SAR imaging method\nthat can realize multilook processing simultaneously during image\nreconstruction. The main idea is to replace the SAR observation matrix by the\ninverse of multilook procedures, which is then combined with random sampling\nmatrix to yield a multilook CS-SAR observation model. Then a joint sparse\nregularization model, considering pixel dependency of subimages, is derived to\nform multilook images.

Within this thesis, sparsity refers to the fact that a\nvector to be estimated has only few nonzero entries. One specific field\nconcerned with sparsity constraints has become popular under the name\nCompressed Sensing (CS). Within CS, the sparsity is exploited in order to\nperform (nearly) lossless compression. Moreover, this compression is carried\nout jointly or simultaneously with the process of sensing a physical quantity.\nIn contrast to CS, one can alternatively use sparsity to enhance signal\nprocessing methods. Obviously, sparsity constraints can only improve the\nobtainable estimation performance since the constraints can be interpreted as\nan additional prior information about the unknown parameter vector which is to\nbe estimated. Our main focus will be on this aspect of sparsity, i.e., we\nanalyze how much we can gain in estimation performance due to the sparsity\nconstraints.",

To keep the\ndata secret from the eavesdropper, we propose to use cooperating trustworthy\nnodes that assist the fusion center (FC) by injecting artificial noise to\ndeceive the eavesdropper. We seek the answers to the questions: Does CS help\nimprove the security performance in such a framework? What are the optimal\nvalues of parameters which maximize the CS based collaborative detection\nperformance at the FC while ensuring perfect secrecy at the eavesdropper?",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear spatial encoding magnetic (SEM) fields have been studied to\ncomplement multichannel RF encoding and accelerate MRI scans. Published schemes\ninclude PatLoc, O-Space, Null Space, 4D-RIO, and others, but the large variety\nof possible approaches to exploiting nonlinear SEMs remains mostly unexplored.\nBefore, we have presented a new approach, Fast ROtary Nonlinear Spatial\nACquisition (FRONSAC) imaging, where the nonlinear fields provide a small\nrotating perturbation to standard linear trajectories. While FRONSAC encoding\ngreatly improves image quality, at the highest accelerations or weakest FRONSAC\nfields, some undersampling artifacts remain. However, the under-sampling\nartifacts that occur with FRONSAC encoding are relatively incoherent and well\nsuited to the compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction. CS provides a\nsparsity-promoting convex strategy to reconstruct images from highly\nundersampled datasets. The work presented here combines the benefits of FRONSAC\nand CS. Simulations illustrate that this combination can further improve image\nreconstruction with FRONSAC gradients of low amplitudes and frequencies.",

High\nlocalization accuracy is achieved through a probabilistic information transfer\nbetween the CS and DT parts of the underlying factor graph. Simulation results\ndemonstrate significant improvements in both agent self-localization and object\nlocalization performance compared to separate CS and DT, and very good scaling\nproperties with respect to the numbers of agents and objects.",

Two theories are named Spin(7) dual if they have the same moduli\nspace: a real Spin(7) cone with base a weak G_2 manifold, and they are hence\nholographic dual to the same AdS_4 x G_2 M theory solution. We provide a\nsystematic way to generate these dualities, derived by combining toric duality\nfor N=2 CS-matter theories and generalized non-holomorphic orientifold\nprojections to N=1.

    "title": "Group-based Sparse Representation for Image Compressive Sensing\n  Reconstruction with Non-Convex Regularization",
    "abstract": "Patch-based sparse representation modeling has shown great potential in image\ncompressive sensing (CS) reconstruction. However, this model usually suffers\nfrom some limits, such as dictionary learning with great computational\ncomplexity, neglecting the relationship among similar patches. In this paper, a\ngroup-based sparse representation method with non-convex regularization\n(GSR-NCR) for image CS reconstruction is proposed. In GSR-NCR, the local\nsparsity and nonlocal self-similarity of images is simultaneously considered in\na unified framework. Different from the previous methods based on\nsparsity-promoting convex regularization, we extend the non-convex weighted Lp\n(0 < p < 1) penalty function on group sparse coefficients of the data matrix,\nrather than conventional L1-based regularization. To reduce the computational\ncomplexity, instead of learning the dictionary with a high computational\ncomplexity from natural images, we learn the principle component analysis (PCA)\nbased dictionary for each group. Moreover, to make the proposed scheme\ntractable and robust, we have developed an efficient iterative\nshrinkage/thresholding algorithm to solve the non-convex optimization problem.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many\nstate-of-the-art techniques for image CS reconstruction.",

Results show that better quality\nreconstruction can be obtained using Net-FLICS, for both simulation and\nexperimental dataset, with almost negligible time compared to the traditional\nanalytic methods.

    "abstract": "Characteristic sets (CS) organize RDF triples based on the set of properties\ncharacterizing their subject nodes.

While most\nCS-based approaches yield significant improvements in space and query\nperformance, they fail to perform well in the presence of schema heterogeneity,\ni.e., when the number of CSs becomes very large, resulting in a highly\npartitioned data organization. In this paper, we address this problem by\nintroducing a novel technique, for merging CSs based on their hierarchical\nstructure. Our technique employs a lattice to capture the hierarchical\nrelationships between CSs, identifies dense CSs and merges dense CSs with their\nancestors, thus reducing the size of the CSs as well as the links between them.\nWe implemented our algorithm on top of a relational backbone, where each merged\nCS is stored in a relational table, and we performed an extensive experimental\nstudy to evaluate the performance and impact of merging to the storage and\nquerying of RDF datasets, indicating significant improvements.",

    "abstract": "Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is continuing an active research field\nnowadays for high dimensional data. It aims to estimate the central subspace\n(CS) without making distributional assumption. To overcome the\nlarge-$p$-small-$n$ problem we propose a new approach for SDR. Our method\ncombines the following ideas for high dimensional data analysis: (1) Randomly\npartition the covariates into subsets and use distance correlation (DC) to\nconstruct a sketch of envelope subspace with low dimension. (2) Obtain a sketch\nof the CS by applying conventional SDR method within the constructed envelope\nsubspace. (3) Repeat the above two steps for a few times and integrate these\nmultiple sketches to form the final estimate of the CS. We name the proposed\nSDR procedure \"integrated random-partition SDR (iRP-SDR)\". Comparing with\nexisting methods, iRP-SDR is less affected by the selection of tuning\nparameters. Moreover, the estimation procedure of iRP-SDR does not involve the\ndetermination of the structural dimension until at the last stage, which makes\nthe method more robust in a high-dimensional setting. Asymptotic properties of\niRP-SDR are also established. The advantageous performance of the proposed\nmethod is demonstrated via simulation studies and the EEG data analysis.",

This allows to increase the measurement speed and to reduce system\ncosts. Instead of collecting point-wise measurements, in CS one uses various\ncombinations of pressure values at different sensor locations. Sparsity is the\nmain condition allowing to recover the photoacoustic (PA) source from\ncompressive measurements. In this paper we introduce a new concept enabling\nsparse recovery in CS PAT. Our approach is based on the fact that the second\ntime derivative applied to the measured pressure data corresponds to the\napplication of the Laplacian to the original PA source. As typical PA sources\nconsist of smooth parts and singularities along interfaces the Laplacian of the\nsource is sparse (or at least compressible). To efficiently exploit the induced\nsparsity we develop a reconstruction framework to jointly recover the initial\nand the modified sparse source.

We consider a continuous\ndictionary based on sub-sampling in the antenna domain via a small number of\nradio frequency chains. We show that mmWave channel estimation using ANM can be\nformulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, and the user channel\ncan be accurately estimated via off-the-shelf SDP solvers in polynomial time.\nSimulation results indicate that ANM can achieve much better estimation\naccuracy compared to grid-based CS, and significantly improves the spectral\nefficiency provided by multi-user precoding.",

In this\npaper, we propose the expectation propagation based joint AUD and CE\n(EP-AUD/CE) technique for mMTC networks. The expectation propagation (EP)\nalgorithm is a Bayesian framework that approximates a computationally\nintractable probability distribution to an easily tractable distribution. The\nproposed technique finds the best approximation of the posterior distribution\nof the sparse channel vector. Using the approximate distribution, AUD and CE\nare jointly performed. We show by numerical simulations that the proposed\ntechnique substantially enhances AUD and CE performances over competing\nalgorithms.",

However, it can be shown that the number of acquisitions\nand the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be traded off against each other,\nbecause it is asymptotically only the product of the number of acquisitions and\nSNR that determines the reconstruction quality.

The CS theory shows that any signal/image can be undersampled at\na rate dependent on its intrinsic complexity. Moreover, in such undersampling\nregimes, the signal can be recovered by sparsity promoting convex\nregularization like $\\ell_1$- or total variation (TV-) minimization. Precise\nrelations between many low complexity measures and the sufficient number of\nrandom measurements are known for many sparsity promoting norms.

The antenna\nweight vectors in FALP can be realized in ultra-low power phase shifters whose\nresolution can be as low as one-bit.

    "abstract": "Influence of the finite-length registers and quantization effects on the\nreconstruction of sparse and approximately sparse signals is analyzed in this\npaper. For the nonquantized measurements, the compressive sensing (CS)\nframework provides highly accurate reconstruction algorithms that produce\nnegligible errors when the reconstruction conditions are met. However, hardware\nimplementations of signal processing algorithms involve the finite-length\nregisters and quantization of the measurements. An analysis of the effects\nrelated to the measurements quantization with an arbitrary number of bits is\nthe topic of this paper. A unified mathematical model for the analysis of the\nquantization noise and the signal nonsparsity on the CS reconstruction is\npresented. An exact formula for the expected energy of error in the CS-based\nreconstructed signal is derived. The theory is validated through various\nnumerical examples with quantized measurements, including the cases of\napproximately sparse signals, noise folding, and floating-point arithmetics.",

The low-field one is supposed to\nbe a consequence of a collinear ground state stabilized by the anisotropy,\nwhile the other plateau bears characteristics of an \"up-up-down\" state\nexclusive for lattices with triangular exchange patterns. Such coexistence of\nthe magnetization plateaux is a fingerprint of competition between the\nanisotropy and the geometric frustration in Cs$_2$CoBr$_4$.",

In three neutrino generations the evolution of\nthe neutrino flux traveling the coupled sunspots (CS's) which are the SF source\nis considered. It is assumed that the neutrinos possess both the dipole\nmagnetic moment and the anapole moment while the magnetic field above the CS's\nmay reach the values $10^5-10^6$ Gs, displays the twisting nature and has the\nnonpotential character. The possible resonance conversions of the solar\nneutrino flux are examined.

In this paper, to\nsolve the visual image CS problem, we propose a deep unfolding model dubbed\nAMP-Net.

Furthermore, AMP-Net integrates deblocking modules in order\nto eliminate the blocking artifacts that usually appear in CS of visual images.\nIn addition, the sampling matrix is jointly trained with other network\nparameters to enhance the reconstruction performance.

    "abstract": "Training a code-switching (CS) language model using only monolingual data is\nstill an ongoing research problem. In this paper, a CS language model is\ntrained using only monolingual training data. As recurrent neural network (RNN)\nmodels are best suited for predicting sequential data. In this work, an RNN\nlanguage model is trained using alternate batches from only monolingual English\nand Spanish data and the perplexity of the language model is computed. From the\nresults, it is concluded that using alternate batches of monolingual data in\ntraining reduced the perplexity of a CS language model. The results were\nconsistently improved using mean square error (MSE) in the output embeddings of\nRNN based language model. By combining both methods, perplexity is reduced from\n299.63 to 80.38. The proposed methods were comparable to the language model\nfine tune with code-switch training data.",

    "abstract": "The SPARKLING algorithm was originally developed for accelerated 2D magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) in the compressed sensing (CS) context. It yields\nnon-Cartesian sampling trajectories that jointly fulfill a target sampling\ndensity while each individual trajectory complies with MR hardware constraints.\nHowever, the two main limitations of SPARKLING are first that the optimal\ntarget sampling density is unknown and thus a user-defined parameter and second\nthat this sampling pattern generation remains disconnected from MR image\nreconstruction thus from the optimization of image quality. Recently,\ndatadriven learning schemes such as LOUPE have been proposed to learn a\ndiscrete sampling pattern, by jointly optimizing the whole pipeline from data\nacquisition to image reconstruction. In this work, we merge these methods with\na state-of-the-art deep neural network for image reconstruction, called XPDNET,\nto learn the optimal target sampling density. Next, this density is used as\ninput parameter to SPARKLING to obtain 20x accelerated non-Cartesian\ntrajectories. These trajectories are tested on retrospective compressed sensing\n(CS) studies and show superior performance in terms of image quality with both\ndeep learning (DL) and conventional CS reconstruction schemes.",

The ambient molecular gas at the distance (9 kpc) of the\nremnant comprises a giant molecular cloud whose edge is closely parallel to a\nridge of bright non-thermal radio continuum, which evidently delineates the\nblast-wave into the cloud.

The wide spectral component is relatively brighter in the\nhigher-excitation lines. We interpret the wide spectral component as post-shock\ngas, either smoothly accelerated or partially dissociated and reformed behind\nthe shock. The narrow component is either the pre-shock gas or cold gas\nreformed behind a fully dissociative shock. Using the 3 observed CS lines, we\nmeasured the temperature, CS column density, and H2 volume density in a dense\nclump in the parent molecular cloud as well as the wide-line and narrow-line\nportions of the shocked clump.

The sample is a subset of a sample\noriginally selected toward water masers; the selection on maser sources should\nfavor sources in an early stage of evolution. The integrated intensity of CS\nJ=5-4 correlates very well with the dust continuum emission at 350 microns. The\ndistributions of size, virial mass, surface density, and luminosity are all\npeaked with a few cores skewed towards much larger values than the mean. We\nfind a weak correlation between C34S linewidth and size, consistent with Dv ~\nR^{0.3}. The linewidths are much higher than would be predicted by the usual\nrelations between linewidth and size determined from regions of lower mass.\nThese regions are very turbulent. The derived virial mass agrees within a\nfactor of 2 to 3 with mass estimates from dust emission at 350 microns after\ncorrections for the density structure are accounted for. The resulting\ncumulative mass spectrum of cores above 1000 solar masses can be approximated\nby a power law with a slope of about -0.9, steeper than that of clouds measured\nwith tracers of lower density gas and close to that for the total masses of\nstars in OB associations.

The spectrum features global\nH charges, vortices carrying flux labeled by the elements of H and dyonic\ncombinations. Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect these particles exhibit\ntoplogical interactions. The remnant of the U(1)^k CS term in the discrete H\ngauge theory describing the effective long distance physics of such a model is\nshown to be a 3-cocycle for H summarizing the nontrivial topological\ninteractions cast upon the magnetic vortices by the U(1)^k CS term.

Reconnection is\nassumed to happen in a small patch across a Syrovatski\\'i (non-uniform) current\nsheet (CS) with skewed magnetic fields. The background magnetic pressure has\nits maximum at the center of the CS plane, and decreases toward the edges of\nthe plane. The reconnection patch creates two V-shaped reconnected tubes that\nshorten as they retract in opposite directions, due to magnetic tension. One of\nthem moves upward toward the top edge of the CS, and the other one moves\ndownward toward the top of the underlying arcade. Rotational discontinuities\n(RDs) propagate along the legs of the tubes and generate parallel super-sonic\nflows that collide at the center of the tube. There, gas dynamics shocks that\ncompress and heat the plasma are launched outwardly. The descending tube moves\nthrough the bottom part of the CS where it expands laterally in response to the\nbackground magnetic pressure. This effect may decrease plasma density by 30 %\nto 50 % of background levels. This tube will arrive at the top of the arcade\nthat will slow it down to a stop. Here, the perpendicular dynamics is halted,\nbut the parallel dynamics continues along its legs; the RDs are shut down, and\nthe gas is rarified to even lower densities. The hot postshock regions continue\nevolving, determining a long lasting hot region on top of the arcade.

The derived source averaged\nCS/methanol column densities and rotation temperatures are similar to those\nfound in normal spiral and starburst galaxies, suggesting dense clouds are\nlittle affected by the differences between galaxy types.

Using this fact, the chemical models of Bayet et\nal.

As such the CS is a `forward-trajectory' semi-Lagrangian\nscheme. For multi-dimensional simulations of neutral gas flows, the\ncell-centered version of this semi-Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme has advantages over\nother options due to its implementation simplicity, low memory requirements,\nand easier treatment of boundary conditions. The main drawback of the CCSL-CS\nto date has been its high numerical diffusion in physical space, because of the\n2$^{\\text{nd}}$ order remapping that takes place at the end of each time step.\nBy means of a Modified Equation Analysis, it is shown that a high order\nestimate of the remapping error can be obtained a priori, and a small\ncorrection to the final position of the cells can be applied upon remapping, in\norder to achieve full compensation of this error. The resulting scheme is\n4$^{\\text{th}}$ order accurate in space while retaining the desirable\nproperties of the CS: it is conservative and positivity-preserving, and the\noverall algorithm complexity is not appreciably increased. Two monotone (i.e.\nnon-oscillating) versions of the fourth order CCSL-CS are also presented: one\nuses a common flux-limiter approach; the other uses a non-polynomial\nreconstruction to evaluate the derivatives of the density function.

CS\nmodified gravitational waves are sufficiently different from the General\nRelativistic expectation that they lead to significant dephasing after 3 weeks\nof evolution, but such dephasing will probably not prevent detection of these\nsignals, but instead lead to a systematic error in the determination of\nparameters. We end with a study of radiation-reaction in the modified theory\nand show that, to leading-order, energy-momentum emission is not CS modified,\nexcept possibly for the subdominant effect of scalar-field emission. The\ninclusion of radiation-reaction will allow for tests of CS modified gravity\nwith space-borne detectors that might be two orders of magnitude larger than\ncurrent binary pulsar bounds.",

    "abstract": "Recent exo-planetary surveys reveal that planets can orbit and survive around\nbinary stars. This suggests that some fraction of young binary systems which\npossess massive circumbinary disks (CB) may be in the midst of planet\nformation. However, there are very few CB disks detected. We revisit one of the\nknown CB disks, the UY Aurigae system, and probe 13CO 2-1, C18O 2-1, SO\n5(6)-4(5) and 12CO 3-2 line emission and the thermal dust continuum. Our new\nresults confirm the existence of the CB disk. In addition, the circumstellar\n(CS) disks are clearly resolved in dust continuum at 1.4 mm. The spectral\nindices between the wavelengths of 0.85 mm and 6 cm are found to be\nsurprisingly low, being 1.6 for both CS disks. The deprojected separation of\nthe binary is 1.26\" based on our 1.4 mm continuum data. This is 0.07\" (10 AU)\nlarger than in earlier studies. Combining the fact of the variation of UY Aur B\nin $R$ band, we propose that the CS disk of an undetected companion UY Aur Bb\nobscures UY Aur Ba. A very complex kinematical pattern inside the CB disk is\nobserved due to a mixing of Keplerian rotation of the CB disk, the infall and\noutflow gas. The streaming gas accreting from the CB ring toward the CS disks\nand possible outflows are also identified and resolved. The SO emission is\nfound to be at the bases of the streaming shocks. Our results suggest that the\nUY Aur system is undergoing an active accretion phase from the CB disk to the\nCS disks. The UY Aur B might also be a binary system, making the UY Aur a\ntriple system.",

Exploring the distribution of different molecular species allows us to\nunderstand the physical processes affecting the ISM both in the AGN vicinity as\nwell as in the outer star forming molecular ring. We carried out 3 mm ALMA\nobservations of HCN, HCO+, CCH, CS, HNCO, SiO, HC3N, and SO as well as the 13C\nisotopologues. All species were imaged over the central 2 kpc (~30\") of the\ngalaxy at a resolution of ~2.2\"x1.5 (150 pc x 100 pc). HCO+ and CS appear to be\nslightly enhanced in the star forming ring. CCH, showing the largest variations\nacross NGC 1097, is suggested to be a good tracer of both obscured and early\nstage star formation. HNCO, SiO and HC3N are significantly enhanced in the\ninner circumnuclear disk surrounding the AGN. Differences in the molecular\nabundances are observed between the star forming ring and the inner\ncircumnuclear disk. We conclude that the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CS differences\nobserved between AGN dominated and starburst galaxies are not due to a HCN\nenhancement due to X-rays, but rather this enhancement is produced by shocked\nmaterial at distances of 200 pc from the AGN. Additionally we claim the lower\nHCN/CS to be a combination of a small under-abundance of CS in AGNs together\nwith excitation effects, where a high dense gas component (~10^6 cm^-3) may be\nmore prominent in SB galaxies. However the most promising are the differences\nfound among the dense gas tracers which, at our modest spatial resolution, seem\nto outline the physical structure of the molecular disk around the AGN. In this\npicture, HNCO probes the well shielded gas in the disk, surrounding the dense\nmaterial moderately exposed to X-ray radiation traced by HC3N.

The unprecedented sensitivity\nof the survey allows us to carefully analyse the line profiles, revealing\nhigh-velocity emission, up to 20 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic. The\nprofiles can be well fitted by a combination of two exponential laws that are\nremarkably similar to what previously found using CO. These components have\nbeen related to the cavity walls produced by the $\\sim$ 2000 yr B1 shock and\nthe older ($\\sim$ 4000 yr) B2 shock, respectively.

At the interface, the intensity of the\neffect produced on the surface tension by increasing T above LCST diminishes\ncontinuously as cs increases, reducing the ability of the interfacial complex\nto respond to temperature changes. We studied the stability of aqueous foams\nformulated with these mixtures as a function of T and cs.

The\nabundances were compared to those observed in two classical metal-poor stars:\nthe typical r-rich star CS 31082-001 ([Eu/Fe] > +1.0) and the r-poor star HD\n122563 ([Eu/Fe] < 0.0), which are known to present a strong enrichment of the\nfirst peak neutron-capture elements relative to the second peak. Within the\nfirst peak, the abundances are well correlated in analogy to the well-known\ncorrelation inside the abundances of the second-peak elements. In contrast,\nthere is no correlation between any first peak element with any second peak\nelement. We show that the scatter of the ratio of the first peak abundance over\nsecond peak abundance increases when the mean abundance of the second peak\nelements decreases from r-rich to r-poor stars. We found two new r-poor stars\nthat are very similar to HD 122563. A third r-poor star, CS 22897-008, is even\nmore extreme; this star shows the most extreme example of first peak elements\nenrichment to date.

The distribution of the\nneutron-capture elements in our very metal-poor stars can be understood as the\ncombination of at least two mechanisms: one that enriches the forming stars\ncloud homogeneously through the main r-process and leads to an element pattern\nsimilar to the r-rich stars, such as CS 31082-001; and another that forms\nmainly lighter, first peak elements.",

    "abstract": "In the present study we aim to investigate the circumstellar environment of\nthe spectroscopic binary T Tauri star CS Cha. From unresolved mid- to\nfar-infrared photometry it is predicted that CS Cha hosts a disk with a large\ncavity. In addition, SED modeling suggests significant dust settling, pointing\ntowards an evolved disk that may show signs of ongoing or completed planet\nformation. We observed CS Cha with the high contrast imager VLT/SPHERE in\npolarimetric differential imaging mode to resolve the circumbinary disk in near\ninfrared scattered light. These observations were followed-up by VLT/NACO\nL-band observations and complemented by archival VLT/NACO K-band and HST/WFPC2\nI-band data. We resolve the compact circumbinary disk around CS Cha for the\nfirst time in scattered light. We find a smooth, low inclination disk with an\nouter radius of $\\sim$55 au (at 165 pc). We do not detect the inner cavity but\nfind an upper limit for the cavity size of $\\sim$15 au.

In mMTC, although a large\nnumber of devices are registered to an access point (AP), very few of them are\nactive with uplink short packet transmission at the same time, which requires\nnovel design of protocols and receivers to enable efficient data transmission\nand accurate multi-user detection (MUD).

The\nformulation of higher spin gauge field theories, along with a Chern-Simons (CS)\nlike term for fields of higher spins is presented. Through this setup, general\nfeatures of theories describing massless/massive fields of higher spin in\narbitrary dimensions is discussed. In 2+1 dimensions, the existence of multiple\nmass-generating mechanisms i.e. metric-based masses and topological masses,\noffers the possibility for gauge bosons to acquire mixed masses. This scenario\nis first introduced in a theory of photons where both Proca mass term and CS\nmass term is simultaneously present. The mass-mixing which occurs in this\ntheory is further analysed through the St\\\"uckelberg formalism. Motivated by\nthese results, a theory of massive gravity where gravitons obtain masses from\nboth Fierz-Pauli mass term and CS mass term is studied. This theory allows for\n3 propagating massive graviton modes, and their masses have undergone\nconsiderable mixing. This mass-mixing is made explicit through a St\\\"uckelberg\nanalysis. The bimetric theory of gravity is a non-trivial generalization of the\ntheory of General Relativity. This theory provides a consistent non-linear\ntheory of massive gravity which is studied in detail. In this thesis, the\nbimetric theory of gravity is extended in 2+1 dimensiosn to the theory of\nTopologically Massive Bimetric Gravity (TMBG). In the theory of TMBG, the\nmass-mixing which arises from the interaction of the two metrics and their\ncorresponding CS terms occurs at the nonlinear stage itself. For the version of\nTMBG studied in this thesis, the linearized theory shows that there are 3\nmassive graviton modes, which corresponds to the same 3 modes found earlier.\nFinally, quantum loop corrections to the graviton propagator from massive\nphotons (which acquire mass from both CS and Proca mechanism) is calculated.",

Method: Over 83\nprimary studies indexed in major scientific repositories were identified by our\nsearch string in this SLR. Then, following existing best practices for\nsecondary studies, we applied inclusion/exclusion criteria to select the most\nrelevant works, extract their features and classify them.

    "abstract": "Using gravitational wave observations to search for deviations from general\nrelativity in the strong-gravity regime has become an important research\ndirection. Chern Simons (CS) gravity is one of the most frequently studied\nparity-violating models of strong gravity. It is known that the Kerr black-hole\nis not a solution for CS gravity. At the same time, the only rotating solution\navailable in the literature for dynamical CS (dCS) gravity is the slow-rotating\ncase most accurately known to quadratic order in spin. In this work, for the\nslow-rotating case (accurate to first order in spin), we derive the linear\nperturbation equations governing the metric and the dCS field accurate to\nlinear order in spin and quadratic order in the CS coupling parameter\n($\\alpha$) and obtain the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies. After confirming\nthe recent results of Wagle et al. (2021), we find an additional contribution\nto the eigenfrequency correction at the leading perturbative order of\n$\\alpha^2$. Unlike Wagle et al., we also find corrections to frequencies in the\npolar sector. We compute these extra corrections by evaluating the expectation\nvalues of the perturbative potential on unperturbed QNM wavefunctions along a\ncontour deformed into the complex-$r$ plane. For $\\alpha=0.1 M^2$, we obtain\nthe ratio of the imaginary parts of the dCS correction to the GR correction in\nthe first QNM frequency (in the polar sector) to be $0.263$ implying\nsignificant change. For the $(2,2)-$mode, the dCS corrections make the\nimaginary part of the first QNM of the fundamental mode less negative, thereby\ndecreasing the decay rate. Our results, along with future gravitational wave\nobservations, can be used to test for dCS gravity and further constrain the CS\ncoupling parameters. [abridged]",

    "abstract": "Column density (N) PDFs serve as a powerful tool to characterize the physical\nprocesses that influence the structure of molecular clouds. Star-forming clouds\ncan best be characterized by lognormal PDFs for the lower N range and a\npower-law tail for higher N, commonly attributed to turbulence and self-gravity\nand/or pressure, respectively. We report here on PDFs obtained from\nobservations of 12CO, 13CO, C18O, CS, and N2H+ in the Cygnus X North region and\ncompare to a PDF derived from dust observations with the Herschel satellite.\nThe PDF of 12CO is lognormal for Av~1-30, but is cut for higher Av due to\noptical depth effects. The PDFs of C18O and 13CO are mostly lognormal up for\nAv~1-15, followed by excess up to Av~40. Above that value, all CO PDFs drop,\nmost likely due to depletion. The high density tracers CS and N2H+ exhibit only\na power law distribution between Av~15 and 400, respectively. The PDF from dust\nis lognormal for Av~3-15 and has a power-law tail up to Av~500. Absolute values\nfor the molecular line column densities are, however, rather uncertain due to\nabundance and excitation temperature variations. Taken the dust PDF face value,\nwe 'calibrate' the molecular line PDF of CS to the one of the dust and\ndetermined an abundance [CS]/[H2] of 10^-9. The slopes of the power-law tails\nof the CS, N2H+, and dust PDFs are consistent with free-fall collapse of\nfilaments and clumps. A quasi static configuration of filaments and clumps can\npossibly also account for the observed N-PDFs, as long as they have a\nsufficiently condensed density structure and external ram pressure by gas\naccretion is provided. The somehow flatter slopes of N2H+ and CS can reflect an\nabundance change and/or subthermal excitation at low column densities.",

We calculate the expected rates for ML events where the\nshape distortions will be observable by such followup observations, assuming\nthat the lenses are ordinary main-sequence stars in a bar and in the disk. We\nstudy the dependence of the rates for color-shifted (CS) events on the\nfrequency of followup observations and on the precision of the photometry for a\nvariety of waveband pairings.

The\ndust emission around this source shows a very extended envelope, which accounts\nfor most of the circumstellar mass of 5.1 Msun.

The outflow as traced by CS and CH3OH exhibits two well\ndifferentiated and clumpy lobes, with two prominent northern blueshifted and\nredshifted clumps.

We have performed numerical\nsimulations of PN formation using CS tracks for six stellar core masses\ncorresponding to initial masses from 1 to 5 Msun. The gas structure resulting\nfrom the previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution is used as the\nstarting configuration. The formation of multiple shells is discussed in the\nlight of our models, and the density, velocity and halpha emission brightness\nprofiles are shown for each stellar mass considered. We have computed the\nevolution of the different shells in terms of radius, expansion velocity, and\nhalpha peak emissivity. We find that the evolution of the main shell is\ncontrolled by the ionization front rather than by the thermal pressure provided\nby the hot bubble during the early PN stages. This effect explains why the\nkinematical ages overestimate the age in young CSs. At later stages in the\nevolution and for low mass progenitors the kinematical ages severely\nunderestimate the CS age. Large (up to 2.3 pc), low surface brightness shells\n(less than 2000 times the brightness of the main shell) are formed in all of\nour models (with the exception of the 5 Msun model).

Five of the sources observed\nwere protostellar, ranging in energetics from 1 - 500L_sun, while the other two\nsources were located at a shock front and within a photodissociation region\n(PDR).\n  Statistical equilibrium calculations were used to deduce from the measured\nline strengths the physical conditions within each source and the abundance of\neach molecule. In all cases except the shock and the PDR, the abundance of CO\nwith respect to H_2 appears significantly below (factor of ten) the general\nmolecular cloud value of 10^-4. {Formaldehyde measurements were used to\nestimate a mean temperature and density for the gas in each source.

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates that the transport properties of alkali metals are\ndetermined principally by the repulsive wall of the pair interaction potential\nfunction. The (hard-wall) Lennard-Jones(15-6) effective pair potential function\nis used to calculate transport collision integrals. Accordingly, reduced\ncollision integrals of K, Rb, and Cs metal vapors are obtained from\nChapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzman equation. The law of corresponding\nstates based on the experimental-transport reduced collision integral is used\nto verify the validity of a LJ(15-6) hybrid potential in describing the\ntransport properties. LJ(8.5-4) potential function and a simple thermodynamic\nargument with the input PVT data of liquid metals provide the required\nmolecular potential parameters. Values of the predicted viscosity of monatomic\nalkali metals vapor are in agreement with typical experimental data with the\naverage absolute deviation 2.97% for K in the range 700-1500 K, 1.69% for Rb,\nand 1.75% for Cs in the range 700-2000 K. In the same way, the values of\npredicted thermal conductivity are in agreement with experiment within 2.78%,\n3.25%, and 3.63% for K, Rb, and Cs, respectively. The LJ(15-6) hybrid potential\nwith a hard-wall repulsion character conclusively predicts best transport\nproperties of the three alkali metals vapor.",

    "abstract": "Suppose that $(G,T)$ is a second countable locally compact transformation\ngroup given by a homomorphism $\\ell:G\\to\\Homeo(T)$, and that $A$ is a separable\ncontinuous-trace \\cs-algebra with spectrum $T$. An action $\\alpha:G\\to\\Aut(A)$\nis said to cover $\\ell$ if the induced action of $G$ on $T$ coincides with the\noriginal one.

    "abstract": "This thesis is devoted to the study of three problems on the\nWess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) and Chern-Simons (CS) supergravity theories in the\nHamiltonian framework: 1) The two-dimensional super WZW model coupled to\nsupergravity is constructed. The canonical representation of Kac-Moody algebra\nis extended to the super Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras. Then, the canonical\naction is constructed, invariant under local supersymmetry transformations. The\nmetric tensor and Rarita-Schwinger fields emerge as Lagrange multipliers of the\ncomponents of the super energy-momentum tensor. 2) In higher dimensions, CS\ntheories are irregular systems, that is, they have constraints which are\nfunctionally dependent in some sectors of phase space. In these cases, the\nstandard Dirac procedure must be redefined, as it is shown in the simplified\ncase of finite number of degrees of freedom. Irregular systems fall into two\nclasses depending on their behavior in the vicinity of the constraint surface.\nIn one case, it is possible to regularize the system without ambiguities, while\nin the other, regularization is not always possible and the Hamiltonian and\nLagrangian descriptions may be dynamically inequivalent. Irregularities have\nimportant consequences in the linearized approximation of nonlinear theories.\n3) The dynamics of CS supergravity theory in D=5, based on the supersymmetric\nextension of the AdS algebra, su(2,2|4), is analyzed. A class of backgrounds is\nfound, providing a regular and generic effective theory. Some of these\nbackgrounds are shown to be BPS states. The charges for the simplest choice of\nasymptotic conditions are obtained, and they satisfy a supersymmetric extension\nof the classical WZW(4) algebra, associated to su(2,2|4).",

    "title": "Compressed Sensing of Analog Signals in Shift-Invariant Spaces",
    "abstract": "A traditional assumption underlying most data converters is that the signal\nshould be sampled at a rate exceeding twice the highest frequency. This\nstatement is based on a worst-case scenario in which the signal occupies the\nentire available bandwidth. In practice, many signals are sparse so that only\npart of the bandwidth is used. In this paper, we develop methods for low-rate\nsampling of continuous-time sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces,\ngenerated by m kernels with period T. We model sparsity by treating the case in\nwhich only k out of the m generators are active, however, we do not know which\nk are chosen. We show how to sample such signals at a rate much lower than m/T,\nwhich is the minimal sampling rate without exploiting sparsity. Our approach\ncombines ideas from analog sampling in a subspace with a recently developed\nblock diagram that converts an infinite set of sparse equations to a finite\ncounterpart. Using these two components we formulate our problem within the\nframework of finite compressed sensing (CS) and then rely on algorithms\ndeveloped in that context. The distinguishing feature of our results is that in\ncontrast to standard CS, which treats finite-length vectors, we consider\nsampling of analog signals for which no underlying finite-dimensional model\nexists. The proposed framework allows to extend much of the recent literature\non CS to the analog domain.",

Fusion frames are very\nrich new signal representation methods that use collections of subspaces\ninstead of vectors to represent signals. This work combines these exciting\nfields to introduce a new sparsity model for fusion frames. Signals that are\nsparse under the new model can be compressively sampled and uniquely\nreconstructed in ways similar to sparse signals using standard CS. The\ncombination provides a promising new set of mathematical tools and signal\nmodels useful in a variety of applications. With the new model, a sparse signal\nhas energy in very few of the subspaces of the fusion frame, although it does\nnot need to be sparse within each of the subspaces it occupies. This sparsity\nmodel is captured using a mixed l1/l2 norm for fusion frames.\n  A signal sparse in a fusion frame can be sampled using very few random\nprojections and exactly reconstructed using a convex optimization that\nminimizes this mixed l1/l2 norm. The provided sampling conditions generalize\ncoherence and RIP conditions used in standard CS theory. It is demonstrated\nthat they are sufficient to guarantee sparse recovery of any signal sparse in\nour model.

Finally, the field-object cleaned WD CS in the V vs. B-I\ncolor-magnitude diagram is compared with the models.

The NUV channel provides usable spectral\ninformation in a bandpass covering 2000 - 3400 A with a point source spectral\nresolving power of approximately 100. The primary spectral features in this\nrange include solar continuum scattered from cometary dust and emissions from\nOH and CS molecular bands centered near 3085 and 2575 A, respectively. In\nparticular, we report the only cometary CS emission detected during this event.\nThe observations allow the evolution of these spectral features to be tracked\nover the period of the encounter. In general, the NUV emissions observed from\nTempel 1 are much fainter than those that have been observed by GALEX from\nother comets. However, it is possible to derive production rates for the parent\nmolecules of the species detected by GALEX in Tempel 1 and to determine the\nnumber of these molecules liberated by the impact. The derived quiescent\nproduction rates are Q(H2O) = 6.4e27 molecules/s and Q(CS2) = 6.7e24\nmolecules/s, while the impact produced an additional 1.6e32 H2O molecules and\n1.3e29 CS2 molecules, a similar ratio as in quiescent outgassing.",

Practical ADCs not only sample but\nalso quantize each measurement to a finite number of bits; moreover, there is\nan inverse relationship between the achievable sampling rate and the bit depth.\nIn this paper, we investigate an alternative CS approach that shifts the\nemphasis from the sampling rate to the number of bits per measurement. In\nparticular, we explore the extreme case of 1-bit CS measurements, which capture\njust their sign. Our results come in two flavors. First, we consider ideal\nreconstruction from noiseless 1-bit measurements and provide a lower bound on\nthe best achievable reconstruction error. We also demonstrate that i.i.d.\nrandom Gaussian matrices describe measurement mappings achieving, with\noverwhelming probability, nearly optimal error decay. Next, we consider\nreconstruction robustness to measurement errors and noise and introduce the\nBinary $\\epsilon$-Stable Embedding (B$\\epsilon$SE) property, which\ncharacterizes the robustness measurement process to sign changes. We show the\nsame class of matrices that provide almost optimal noiseless performance also\nenable such a robust mapping.

Experimental results\nshow that the framework can reconstruct the raw recordings with high quality.\nEspecially, the reconstruction does not destroy the interdependence relation\namong the multichannel recordings. This ensures that the independent component\nanalysis decomposition of the reconstructed recordings has high fidelity.\nFurthermore, the framework allows the use of a sparse binary sensing matrix\nwith much fewer nonzero entries to compress recordings.

The bulk of the CS literature has focused on the case\nwhere the acquired signal has a sparse or compressible representation in an\northonormal basis. In practice, however, there are many signals that cannot be\nsparsely represented or approximated using an orthonormal basis, but that do\nhave sparse representations in a redundant dictionary. Standard results in CS\ncan sometimes be extended to handle this case provided that the dictionary is\nsufficiently incoherent or well-conditioned, but these approaches fail to\naddress the case of a truly redundant or overcomplete dictionary. In this paper\nwe describe a variant of the iterative recovery algorithm CoSaMP for this more\nchallenging setting. We utilize the D-RIP, a condition on the sensing matrix\nanalogous to the well-known restricted isometry property. In contrast to prior\nwork, the method and analysis are \"signal-focused\"; that is, they are oriented\naround recovering the signal rather than its dictionary coefficients. Under the\nassumption that we have a near-optimal scheme for projecting vectors in signal\nspace onto the model family of candidate sparse signals, we provide provable\nrecovery guarantees. Developing a practical algorithm that can provably compute\nthe required near-optimal projections remains a significant open problem, but\nwe include simulation results using various heuristics that empirically exhibit\nsuperior performance to traditional recovery algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a general multi-level model for self-adaptive systems. A\nself-adaptive system is seen as composed by two levels: the lower level\ndescribing the actual behaviour of the system and the upper level accounting\nfor the dynamically changing environmental constraints on the system. In order\nto keep our description as general as possible, the lower level is modelled as\na state machine and the upper level as a second-order state machine whose\nstates have associated formulas over observable variables of the lower level.\nThus, each state of the second-order machine identifies the set of lower-level\nstates satisfying the constraints. Adaptation is triggered when a second-order\ntransition is performed; this means that the current system no longer can\nsatisfy the current high-level constraints and, thus, it has to adapt its\nbehaviour by reaching a state that meets the new constraints. The semantics of\nthe multi-level system is given by a flattened transition system that can be\nstatically checked in order to prove the correctness of the adaptation model.\nTo this aim we formalize two concepts of weak and strong adaptability providing\nboth a relational and a logical characterization. We report that this work\ngives a formal computational characterization of multi-level self-adaptive\nsystems, evidencing the important role that (theoretical) computer science\ncould play in the emerging science of complex systems.",

    "abstract": "In this note we classify a certain family of solutions of Lovelock gravity in\nthe Chern-Simons (CS) case, in arbitrary (odd) dimension greater than four. The\nspacetime is characterized by admitting a metric that is a warped product of a\ntwo-dimensional spacetime M2 and an (a priori) arbitrary Euclidean base\nmanifold Sigma(d-2) of dimension d-2. We show that the solutions are naturally\nclassified in terms of the equations that restrict the base manifold. According\nto the strength of such constraints we found the following branches in which\nSigma(d-2) has to fulfill: a Lovelock equation with a single vacuum (Euclidean\nLovelock Chern-Simons in dimension d-2), a single scalar equation that is the\ntrace of an Euclidean Lovelock CS equation in dimension d-2, or finally a\ndegenerate case in which the base manifold is not restricted at all. We show\nthat all the cases have some degeneracy in the sense that the metric functions\nare not completely fixed by the field equations. This result extends the static\nfive-dimensional case previously discussed in Phys.Rev. D76 (2007) 064038, and\nit shows that in the CS case, the inclusion of higher powers in the curvature\ndoes not introduce new branches of solutions in Lovelock gravity.

Here we describe a sub-Nyquist sampling and recovery approach\ncalled Doppler focusing which addresses all of these problems: it performs low\nrate sampling and digital processing, imposes no restrictions on the\ntransmitter, and uses a CS dictionary with size which does not increase with\nincreasing number of pulses P. Furthermore, in the presence of noise, Doppler\nfocusing enjoys an SNR increase which scales linearly with P, obtaining good\ndetection performance even at SNRs as low as -25dB. The recovery is based on\nthe Xampling framework, which allows reducing the number of samples needed to\naccurately represent the signal, directly in the analog-to-digital conversion\nprocess. After sampling, the entire digital recovery process is performed on\nthe low rate samples without having to return to the Nyquist rate.

Subsequent efforts have shown\nthat the performance of CS can be improved by exploiting additional structure\nin the locations of the nonzero signal coefficients during inference, or by\nutilizing some form of data-dependent adaptive measurement focusing during the\nsensing process. To our knowledge, our own previous work was the first to\nestablish the potential benefits that can be achieved when fusing the notions\nof adaptive sensing and structured sparsity -- that work examined the task of\nsupport recovery from noisy linear measurements, and established that an\nadaptive sensing strategy specifically tailored to signals that are tree-sparse\ncan significantly outperform adaptive and non-adaptive sensing strategies that\nare agnostic to the underlying structure. In this work we establish fundamental\nperformance limits for the task of support recovery of tree-sparse signals from\nnoisy measurements, in settings where measurements may be obtained either\nnon-adaptively (using a randomized Gaussian measurement strategy motivated by\ninitial CS investigations) or by any adaptive sensing strategy.

Investigation on its mechanism sheds light on the\nunderstanding and controlling of the formation of solidifying metals,earth's\ncore, igneous rock and sea ice. Until now, it still remains controversial what\ncomposes the density contrasts and, to what extent, how it affects channel\nsegregates. Here, we show that in experimental 500kg and 100 ton commercial\ncast steel ingots CS originates from oxide Al2O3/MnS impurity clusters (OICs)\ninitially nucleated from the oxide (Al2O3) particles, which induce an extra\nflow due to sharp density contrast between clusters and melt.

This study extends the\nclassical macrosegregation theory, highlights a significant technological\nbreakthrough to control CS, and could quickly yield practical benefits to the\nworldwide manufacture of over 50 million tons of ingots, super-thick slab and\nheavy castings annually, as well as has general implications for the\nelaboration of other related natural phenomena.",

Quantitative results for $^6$Li -$^{133}$Cs are presented and compared\nto previously measured $^6$Li -$^{133}$Cs Feshbach resonances (FRs) [M. Repp et\nal., Phys. Rev. A 87 010701(R) (2013)]. We demonstrate how the accuracy of the\nABM can be stepwise improved by including magnetic dipole-dipole interactions\nand coupling to a non-dominant virtual state. We present a MQDT calculation,\nwhere magnetic dipole-dipole and second order spin-orbit interactions are\nincluded. A frame transformation formalism is introduced, which allows the\nassignment of measured FRs with only three parameters. All three models achieve\na total rms error of < 1G on the observed FRs.

    "title": "Achieving Autonomous Compressive Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios",
    "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) technologies present many advantages over other\nexisting approaches for implementing wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive\nradios (CRs), such as reduced sampling rate and computational complexity.\nHowever, there are two significant challenges: 1) choosing an appropriate\nnumber of sub-Nyquist measurements, and 2) deciding when to terminate the\ngreedy recovery algorithm that reconstructs wideband spectrum. In this paper,\nan autonomous compressive spectrum sensing (ACSS) framework is presented that\nenables a CR to automatically choose the number of measurements while\nguaranteeing the wideband spectrum recovery with a small predictable recovery\nerror. This is realized by the proposed measurement infrastructure and the\nvalidation technique. The proposed ACSS can find a good spectral estimate with\nhigh confidence by using only a small testing subset in both noiseless and\nnoisy environments. Furthermore, a sparsity-aware spectral recovery algorithm\nis proposed to recover the wideband spectrum without requiring knowledge of the\ninstantaneous spectral sparsity level. Such an algorithm bridges the gap\nbetween CS theory and practical spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that\nACSS can not only recover the spectrum using an appropriate number of\nmeasurements, but can also considerably improve the spectral recovery\nperformance compared with existing CS approaches. The proposed recovery\nalgorithm can autonomously adopt a proper number of iterations, therefore\nsolving the problems of under-fitting or over-fitting which commonly exist in\nmost greedy recovery algorithms.",

A core\npart of our communication framework is the utilization of Road Side Units\n(RSUs) to bridge the information flow from CSs to EVs, which has been regarded\nas a type of cost-efficient communication infrastructure. Under this design, we\nintroduce two complementary communication modes of signalling protocols, namely\nPush and Pull Modes, in order to enable the required information dissemination\noperation.

A collisionless shock (CS) is usually assumed to\nreplace it during shock breakout (SB). We demonstrate here that for some\nrealistic progenitors enshrouded in optically thick winds, such as possibly SN\n2008D, a CS forms deep inside the wind, soon after the RDS leaves the core, and\ntherefore significantly before SB. The RDS does not survive the transition from\nthe core to the thick wind when the wind close to the core is not sufficiently\ndense to compensate for the $r^{-2}$ dilution of photons due to shock\ncurvature. This typically happens when the shock velocity is $\\lesssim 0.1 {\\rm\nc} \\, (\\frac{u_{\\rm w}}{10\\,{\\rm km/s}}) (\\frac{\\dot{M}}{5 \\cdot 10^{-4} \\,\n{\\rm M}_\\odot {\\rm /yr}})^{-1} (\\frac{r_\\ast}{10^{13}\\,{\\rm cm}})$, where\n$u_{\\rm w}$, $\\dot{M}$ and $r_\\ast$ are respectively the wind velocity,\nmass-loss rate and radius of the progenitor star.

We present an extension of the low-rank\nrepresentation (LRR) model, termed the clustering-aware structure-constrained\nlow-rank representation (CS-LRR) model, for unsupervised learning of human\naction attributes from video data. Our model is based on the union-of-subspaces\n(UoS) framework, and integrates spectral clustering into the LRR optimization\nproblem for better subspace clustering results. We lay out an efficient linear\nalternating direction method to solve the CS-LRR optimization problem. We also\nintroduce a hierarchical subspace clustering approach, termed hierarchical\nCS-LRR, to learn the attributes without the need for a priori specification of\ntheir number. By visualizing and labeling these action attributes, the\nhierarchical model can be used to semantically summarize long video sequences\nof human actions at multiple resolutions. A human action or activity can also\nbe uniquely represented as a sequence of transitions from one action attribute\nto another, which can then be used for human action recognition.

    "abstract": "We present a detailed 1.2 mm continuum and CS spectral line study of a large\nsample of 69 massive star forming regions in very early stages of evolution,\nmost of them prior to building up an ultracompact HII region. The continuum\ndata show a zoo of different morphologies and give detailed information on the\nspatial distributions, the masses, column densities and average densities of\nthe whole sample. Fitting the radial intensity profiles shows that three\nparameters are needed to describe the spatial distribution of the sources:\nconstant emission from the center out to a few arcsec radius followed by a\nfirst power law intensity distribution which steepens further outside into a\nsecond power law distribution. The mean inner power law intensity index mi\n(I~r^(-mi)) is 1.2 corresponding to density indices p (n~r^(-p)) of 1.6. In\ntotal the density distribution of our massive star formations sites seem to be\nnot too different from their low-mass counterparts, but we show that setting\ntight constrains on the density indices is very difficult and subject to many\npossible errors. The local densities we derive from CS calculations are higher\n(up to one order of magnitude) than the mean densities we find via the\nmm-continuum. Such inhomogeneous density distribution reflects most likely the\nubiquitous phenomenon of clumping and fragmentation in molecular clouds.\nLinewidth-mass relations show a departure from virial equilibrium in the stages\nof strongly collapsing cores.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of ubiquitous computing there are two design parameters of\nwireless communication devices that become very important power: efficiency and\nproduction cost. Compressive sensing enables the receiver in such devices to\nsample below the Shannon-Nyquist sampling rate, which may lead to a decrease in\nthe two design parameters. This paper investigates the use of Compressive\nSensing (CS) in a general Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) receiver. We\nshow that when using spread spectrum codes in the signal domain, the CS\nmeasurement matrix may be simplified. This measurement scheme, named\nCompressive Spread Spectrum (CSS), allows for a simple, effective receiver\ndesign. Furthermore, we numerically evaluate the proposed receiver in terms of\nbit error rate under different signal to noise ratio conditions and compare it\nwith other receiver structures. These numerical experiments show that though\nthe bit error rate performance is degraded by the subsampling in the CS-enabled\nreceivers, this may be remedied by including quantization in the receiver\nmodel. We also study the computational complexity of the proposed receiver\ndesign under different sparsity and measurement ratios.

Four stars with very low Sr/Ba ratios were observed\nand analyzed within LTE approximation through 1D (hydrostatic) model\natmosphere, providing homogeneous abundances of nine neutron-capture elements.\nIn CS 22950-173, the only turnoff star of the sample, the Sr/Ba ratio is, in\nfact, found to be higher than the r-only solar ratio, so the star is discarded.\nThe remaining stars (CS 29493-090, CS 30322-023, HE 305-4520) are cool evolved\ngiants. They do not present a clear carbon enrichment. The abundance patterns\nof the neutron-capture elements in the three stars are strikingly similar to a\ntheoretical s-process pattern.

In the proposed scheme, referred to as the analog fountain compressive\nsensing (AFCS), each measurement is generated from a linear combination of L\nrandomly selected binary signal elements with real weight coefficients. The\nweight coefficients are chosen from a finite weight set and L, called\nmeasurement degree, is obtained based on a predefined degree distribution\nfunction. We propose a simple verification based reconstruction algorithm for\nthe AFCS in the noiseless case. The proposed verification based decoder is\nanalyzed through SUM-OR tree analytical approach and an optimization problem is\nformulated to find the optimum measurement degree to minimize the number of\nmeasurements required for the reconstruction of binary sparse signals. We show\nthat in the AFCS, the number of required measurements is of O(-n log(1-k/n)),\nwhere n is the signal length and k is the signal sparsity level.

    "title": "Mixed one-bit compressive sensing with applications to overexposure\n  correction for CT reconstruction",
    "abstract": "When a measurement falls outside the quantization or measurable range, it\nbecomes saturated and cannot be used in classical reconstruction methods. For\nexample, in C-arm angiography systems, which provide projection radiography,\nfluoroscopy, digital subtraction angiography, and are widely used for medical\ndiagnoses and interventions, the limited dynamic range of C-arm flat detectors\nleads to overexposure in some projections during an acquisition, such as\nimaging relatively thin body parts (e.g., the knee). Aiming at overexposure\ncorrection for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction, we in this paper\npropose a mixed one-bit compressive sensing (M1bit-CS) to acquire information\nfrom both regular and saturated measurements. This method is inspired by the\nrecent progress on one-bit compressive sensing, which deals with only sign\nobservations. Its successful applications imply that information carried by\nsaturated measurements is useful to improve recovery quality. For the proposed\nM1bit-CS model, alternating direction methods of multipliers is developed and\nan iterative saturation detection scheme is established. Then we evaluate\nM1bit-CS on one-dimensional signal recovery tasks. In some experiments, the\nperformance of the proposed algorithms on mixed measurements is almost the same\nas recovery on unsaturated ones with the same amount of measurements. Finally,\nwe apply the proposed method to overexposure correction for CT reconstruction\non a phantom and a simulated clinical image. The results are promising, as the\ntypical streaking artifacts and capping artifacts introduced by saturated\nprojection data are effectively reduced, yielding significant error reduction\ncompared with existing algorithms based on extrapolation.",

    "abstract": "Detection with high dimensional multimodal data is a challenging problem when\nthere are complex inter- and intra- modal dependencies. While several\napproaches have been proposed for dependent data fusion (e.g., based on copula\ntheory), their advantages come at a high price in terms of computational\ncomplexity. In this paper, we treat the detection problem with compressive\nsensing (CS) where compression at each sensor is achieved via low dimensional\nrandom projections. CS has recently been exploited to solve detection problems\nunder various assumptions on the signals of interest, however, its potential\nfor dependent data fusion has not been explored adequately. We exploit the\ncapability of CS to capture statistical properties of uncompressed data in\norder to compute decision statistics for detection in the compressed domain.\nFirst, a Gaussian approximation is employed to perform likelihood ratio (LR)\nbased detection with compressed data. In this approach, inter-modal dependence\nis captured via a compressed version of the covariance matrix of the\nconcatenated (temporally and spatially) uncompressed data vector. We show that,\nunder certain conditions, this approach with a small number of compressed\nmeasurements per node leads to enhanced performance compared to detection with\nuncompressed data using widely considered suboptimal approaches. Second, we\ndevelop a nonparametric approach where a decision statistic based on the second\norder statistics of uncompressed data is computed in the compressed domain.

    "abstract": "The promise of compressive sensing (CS) has been offset by two significant\nchallenges. First, real-world data is not exactly sparse in a fixed basis.\nSecond, current high-performance recovery algorithms are slow to converge,\nwhich limits CS to either non-real-time applications or scenarios where massive\nback-end computing is available. In this paper, we attack both of these\nchallenges head-on by developing a new signal recovery framework we call {\\em\nDeepInverse} that learns the inverse transformation from measurement vectors to\nsignals using a {\\em deep convolutional network}. When trained on a set of\nrepresentative images, the network learns both a representation for the signals\n(addressing challenge one) and an inverse map approximating a greedy or convex\nrecovery algorithm (addressing challenge two). Our experiments indicate that\nthe DeepInverse network closely approximates the solution produced by\nstate-of-the-art CS recovery algorithms yet is hundreds of times faster in run\ntime. The tradeoff for the ultrafast run time is a computationally intensive,\noff-line training procedure typical to deep networks.

    "abstract": "The ability to automatically detect certain types of cells or cellular\nsubunits in microscopy images is of significant interest to a wide range of\nbiomedical research and clinical practices. Cell detection methods have evolved\nfrom employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques. The\nessential idea of these methods is that their cell classifiers or detectors are\ntrained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In\nthis paper, we seek a different route and propose a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN)-based cell detection method that uses encoding of the output\npixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is the sparsely\nlabeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. We employ random projections\nto encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN\nregresses this compressed vector from the input pixels. Furthermore, it is\npossible to stably recover sparse cell locations on the output pixel space from\nthe predicted compressed vector using $L_1$-norm optimization. In the past,\noutput space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in\nconjunction with linear and non-linear predictors. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output space\nencoding.

We\ndemonstrate the importance of taking into account the Control System (CS) for a\nfair assessment of energy flows and consumptions. We model the energy\nconsumption and power to transport an ion by a STA protocol in a multisegmented\nPaul trap. The ion is driven by an externally controlled, moving harmonic\noscillator. Even if no net ion- energy is gained at destination, setting the\ntime-dependent control parameters is a macroscopic operation that costs energy\nand results in energy dissipation for the short time scales implied by the\nintrinsically fast STA processes. The potential minimum is displaced by\nmodulating the voltages on control (dc) electrodes. A secondary effect of the\nmodulation, usually ignored as it does not affect the ion dynamics, is the\ntime- dependent energy shift of the potential minimum. The non trivial part of\nthe energy consumption is due to the electromotive forces to set the electrode\nvoltages through the low-pass filters required to preserve the electronic noise\nfrom decohering the ion's motion. The results for the macroscopic CS (the Paul\ntrap) are compared to the microscopic power and energy of the ion alone.\nSimilarities are found -and may be used quantitatively to minimize costs- only\nwhen the CS-dependent energy shift of the harmonic oscillator is included in\nthe ion energy.",

The\ndistribution of SO is mostly concentrated around the radius of the centrifugal\nbarrier of the simple model.

It consists of two main steps: cell search (CS) on the\ndownlink and random access (RA) on the uplink. Millimeter wave (mmWave)\ncellular systems typically must rely on directional beamforming (BF) in order\nto create a viable connection. The beamforming direction must therefore be\nlearned-as well as used-in the initial access process for mmWave cellular\nnetworks. This paper considers four simple but representative initial access\nprotocols that use various combinations of directional beamforming and\nomnidirectional transmission and reception at the mobile and the BS, during the\nCS and RA phases. We provide a system-level analysis of the success probability\nfor CS and RA for each one, as well as of the initial access delay and\nuser-perceived downlink throughput (UPT). For a baseline exhaustive search\nprotocol, we find the optimal BS beamwidth and observe that in terms of initial\naccess delay it is decreasing as blockage becomes more severe, but is\nrelatively constant (about $\\pi/12$) for UPT. Of the considered protocols, the\nbest trade-off between initial access delay and UPT is achieved under a fast\ncell search protocol.",

    "title": "Performance Limits of Compressive Sensing Channel Estimation in Dense\n  Cloud RAN",
    "abstract": "Towards reducing the training signaling overhead in large scale and dense\ncloud radio access networks (CRAN), various approaches have been proposed based\non the channel sparsification assumption, namely, only a small subset of the\ndeployed remote radio heads (RRHs) are of significance to any user in the\nsystem. Motivated by the potential of compressive sensing (CS) techniques in\nthis setting, this paper provides a rigorous description of the performance\nlimits of many practical CS algorithms by considering the performance of the,\nso called, oracle estimator, which knows a priori which RRHs are of\nsignificance but not their corresponding channel values. By using tools from\nstochastic geometry, a closed form analytical expression of the oracle\nestimator performance is obtained, averaged over distribution of RRH positions\nand channel statistics. Apart from a bound on practical CS algorithms, the\nanalysis provides important design insights, e.g., on how the training sequence\nlength affects performance, and identifies the operational conditions where the\nchannel sparsification assumption is valid. It is shown that the latter is true\nonly in operational conditions with sufficiently large path loss exponents.",

    "abstract": "One-bit compressive sensing (CS) is an advanced version of sparse recovery in\nwhich the sparse signal of interest can be recovered from extremely quantized\nmeasurements. Namely, only the sign of each measurement is available to us. In\nmany applications, the ground-truth signal is not sparse itself, but can be\nrepresented in a redundant dictionary. A strong line of research has addressed\nconventional CS in this signal model including its extension to one-bit\nmeasurements. However, one-bit CS suffers from the extremely large number of\nrequired measurements to achieve a predefined reconstruction error level. A\ncommon alternative to resolve this issue is to exploit adaptive schemes.\nAdaptive sampling acts on the acquired samples to trace the signal in an\nefficient way. In this work, we utilize an adaptive sampling strategy to\nrecover dictionary-sparse signals from binary measurements. For this task, a\nmulti-dimensional threshold is proposed to incorporate the previous signal\nestimates into the current sampling procedure. This strategy substantially\nreduces the required number of measurements for exact recovery. Our proof\napproach is based on the recent tools in high dimensional geometry in\nparticular random hyperplane tessellation and Gaussian width. We show through\nrigorous and numerical analysis that the proposed algorithm considerably\noutperforms state of the art approaches.

    "abstract": "Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) often show relatively high continuum\npolarization ($\\sim 1$\\%) in the late phase. This polarization feature is\ngenerally believed to be due to an inner aspherical core revealed in the late\nphase, while this polarization feature can also be contributed by the effect of\npolarized-scattered echoes by circumstellar (CS) dust around the SN. In this\npaper, we propose a unique method to distinguish polarization from the SN\nejecta and from the light echo. We quantitatively examine wavelength dependence\nof the polarization created by the scattered echoes for various geometries and\namounts of CS dust. It is found that the polarization in the $U$-band has\ncharacteristic features, i.e., the polarization emerges at an earlier phase\nwith higher polarization degree than that in longer wavelengths. These are due\nto the rapid evolution of the $U$-band light curve as well as higher optical\ndepth of dust in shorter wavelengths. Except for the $U$ band, the polarization\nincreases after the plateau phase, and the polarization degree is generally\nhigher for shorter wavelengths. These polarimetric features can be easily\ndistinguished from the polarization expected from an aspherical core, which\npredicts almost no wavelength dependence. Moreover, we show that multi-band\npolarimetric observations for SNe IIP can constrain a parameter space in the CS\ndust mass and distance from the SNe. We thus encourage multi-band polarimetric\nobservations for SNe IIP.",

Current diagnosis of CS relies on labor and cost\nintensive neuroimaging techniques, unsuitable for areas with inadequate access\nto quality medical facilities. Thus, there is a great need for an efficient\ndiagnosis alternative. StrokeSave is a platform for users to self-diagnose for\nprevalence to stroke. The mobile app is continuously updated with heart rate,\nblood pressure, and blood oxygen data from sensors on the patient wrist. Once\nthese measurements reach a threshold for possible stroke, the patient takes\nfacial images and vocal recordings to screen for paralysis attributed to\nstroke. A custom designed lens attached to a phone's camera then takes retinal\nimages for the deep learning model to classify based on presence of retinopathy\nand sends a comprehensive diagnosis. The deep learning model, which consists of\na RNN trained on 100 voice slurred audio files, a SVM trained on 410 vascular\ndata points, and a CNN trained on 520 retinopathy images, achieved a holistic\naccuracy of 95.0 percent when validated on 327 samples. This value exceeds that\nof clinical examination accuracy, which is around 40 to 89 percent, further\ndemonstrating the vital utility of such a medical device.

    "abstract": "Images of static scenes submerged beneath a wavy water surface exhibit severe\nnon-rigid distortions. The physics of water flow suggests that water surfaces\npossess spatio-temporal smoothness and temporal periodicity. Hence they possess\na sparse representation in the 3D discrete Fourier (DFT) basis. Motivated by\nthis, we pose the task of restoration of such video sequences as a compressed\nsensing (CS) problem. We begin by tracking a few salient feature points across\nthe frames of a video sequence of the submerged scene. Using these point\ntrajectories, we show that the motion fields at all other (non-tracked) points\ncan be effectively estimated using a typical CS solver. This by itself is a\nnovel contribution in the field of non-rigid motion estimation. We show that\nthis method outperforms state of the art algorithms for underwater image\nrestoration. We further consider a simple optical flow algorithm based on local\npolynomial expansion of the image frames (PEOF). Surprisingly, we demonstrate\nthat PEOF is more efficient and often outperforms all the state of the art\nmethods in terms of numerical measures. Finally, we demonstrate that a\ntwo-stage approach consisting of the CS step followed by PEOF much more\naccurately preserves the image structure and improves the (visual as well as\nnumerical) video quality as compared to just the PEOF stage.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) based continuous domain\nregularization is emerging as an alternative to the conventional on-the-grid\nsparse regularization for the compressed sensing (CS) due to its ability to\nalleviate the basis mismatch between the true support of the shape in the\ncontinuous domain and the discrete grid. In this paper, we propose a new\noff-the-grid regularization for the CS-MRI reconstruction. Following the recent\nworks on two dimensional FRI, we assume that the discontinuities/edges of the\nimage are localized in the zero level set of a band-limited periodic function.\nThis assumption induces the linear dependencies among the Fourier samples of\nthe gradient of the image, which leads to a low rank two-fold Hankel matrix. We\nfurther observe that the singular value decomposition of a low rank Hankel\nmatrix corresponds to an adaptive tight frame system which can represent the\nimage with sparse canonical coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose\na data driven tight frame based off-the-grid regularization model for the\nCS-MRI reconstruction. To solve the nonconvex and nonsmooth model, a proximal\nalternating minimization algorithm with a guaranteed global convergence is\nadopted. Finally, the numerical experiments show that our proposed data driven\ntight frame based approach outperforms the existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Convex Shapes (CS) are common priors for optic disc and cup segmentation in\neye fundus images. It is important to design proper techniques to represent\nconvex shapes. So far, it is still a problem to guarantee that the output\nobjects from a Deep Neural Convolution Networks (DCNN) are convex shapes. In\nthis work, we propose a technique which can be easily integrated into the\ncommonly used DCNNs for image segmentation and guarantee that outputs are\nconvex shapes. This method is flexible and it can handle multiple objects and\nallow some of the objects to be convex. Our method is based on the dual\nrepresentation of the sigmoid activation function in DCNNs. In the dual space,\nthe convex shape prior can be guaranteed by a simple quadratic constraint on a\nbinary representation of the shapes. Moreover, our method can also integrate\nspatial regularization and some other shape prior using a soft thresholding\ndynamics (STD) method. The regularization can make the boundary curves of the\nsegmentation objects to be simultaneously smooth and convex. We design a very\nstable active set projection algorithm to numerically solve our model. This\nalgorithm can form a new plug-and-play DCNN layer called CS-STD whose outputs\nmust be a nearly binary segmentation of convex objects. In the CS-STD block,\nthe convexity information can be propagated to guide the DCNN in both forward\nand backward propagation during training and prediction process. As an\napplication example, we apply the convexity prior layer to the retinal fundus\nimages segmentation by taking the popular DeepLabV3+ as a backbone network.\nExperimental results on several public datasets show that our method is\nefficient and outperforms the classical DCNN segmentation methods.",

    "title": "Correlation-wise Smoothing: Lightweight Knowledge Extraction for HPC\n  Monitoring Data",
    "abstract": "Modern High-Performance Computing (HPC) and data center operators rely more\nand more on data analytics techniques to improve the efficiency and reliability\nof their operations. They employ models that ingest time-series monitoring\nsensor data and transform it into actionable knowledge for system tuning: a\nprocess known as Operational Data Analytics (ODA). However, monitoring data has\na high dimensionality, is hardware-dependent and difficult to interpret. This,\ncoupled with the strict requirements of ODA, makes most traditional data mining\nmethods impractical and in turn renders this type of data cumbersome to\nprocess. Most current ODA solutions use ad-hoc processing methods that are not\ngeneric, are sensible to the sensors' features and are not fit for\nvisualization.\n  In this paper we propose a novel method, called Correlation-wise Smoothing\n(CS), to extract descriptive signatures from time-series monitoring data in a\ngeneric and lightweight way. Our CS method exploits correlations between data\ndimensions to form groups and produces image-like signatures that can be easily\nmanipulated, visualized and compared. We evaluate the CS method on HPC-ODA, a\ncollection of datasets that we release with this work, and show that it leads\nto the same performance as most state-of-the-art methods while producing\nsignatures that are up to ten times smaller and up to ten times faster, while\ngaining visualizability, portability across systems and clear scaling\nproperties.",

    "abstract": "The well-known Carnahan-Starling (CS) equation of state (EoS) [1] for the\nhard sphere (HS) fluid was derived from a quadratic relation between the\ninteger portions of the virial coefficients, Bn, and their orders, n. Here we\nextend the method to the full virial coefficients Bn for the general\nD-dimensional case. We assume a polynomial function of (D-1)th order for the\nvirial coefficients starting from n=4 and EoS are derived from it. For the hard\nrob (D=1) case, the exact solution is obtained. For the stable hard disk fluid\n(D=2), the most recent virial coefficients up to the 10th [2] and accurate\ncompressibility data[3,4] are employed to construct and test the EoS. For the\nstable hard sphere (D=3) fluid, a new CS-type EoS is constructed and tested\nwith the most recent virial coefficients [5,2] up to the 11th and with the\nhighly-accurate simulation data for compressibility [6-8]. The simple new EoS\nturn out to be as accurate as the highest-level Pade approximations based on\nall available virial coefficients, and significantly improve the CS-type EoS in\nthe hard sphere case. We also shown that as long as the virial coefficients\nobey a polynomial function any EoS derived from it will diverge at the\nnon-physical packing fraction=1.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework and corresponding methods for\nsampling and reconstruction of sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces.\nWe reinterpret the random demodulator, a system that acquires sparse\nbandlimited signals, as a system for acquisition of linear combinations of the\nsamples in the SI setting with the box function as the sampling kernel. The\nsparsity assumption is exploited by compressive sensing (CS) framework for\nrecovery of the SI samples from a reduced set of measurements. The samples are\nsubsequently filtered by a discrete-time correction filter in order to\nreconstruct expansion coefficients of an observed signal. Furthermore, we offer\na generalization of the proposed framework to other sampling kernels that lie\nin arbitrary SI spaces. The generalized method embeds the correction filter in\na CS optimization problem which directly reconstructs expansion coefficients of\nthe signal. Both approaches recast an inherently infinite-dimensional inverse\nproblem as a finite-dimensional CS problem in an exact way. Finally, we conduct\nnumerical experiments on signals in B-spline spaces whose expansion\ncoefficients are assumed to be sparse in a certain transform domain. The\ncoefficients can be regarded as parametric models of an underlying continuous\nsignal, obtained from a reduced set of measurements. Such continuous signal\nrepresentations are particularly suitable for signal processing without\nconverting them into samples.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new method of the automated identification of current sheets\n(CSs) that represents a formalization of the visual inspection approach\nemployed in case studies. CSs are often identified by eye via the analysis of\ncharacteristic changes in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and plasma\nparameters. Known visual and semi-automated empirical methods of CS\nidentification are exact but do not allow a comprehensive statistical analysis\nof CS properties. Existing automated methods partially solve this problem.\nMeanwhile, these methods suggest an analysis of variations of the IMF and its\ndirection only. In our three-parameter empirical method, we employ both the\nsolar wind plasma and IMF parameters to identify CSs of various types.\nDerivatives of the IMF strength, the plasma beta and the ratio of the Alfv'en\nspeed VA to the solar wind speed V taken with the one-second cadence are used.\nWe find that the CS daily rate R correlates with the solar wind temperature T\nrather than with V and is proportional to the sum of the kinetic and thermal\nenergy density ~ V2(N+5N')+10T(N+N'), where N'=2cm^-3 is the background level\nof the solar wind density N.

    "abstract": "The development of novel materials for vacuum electron sources in particle\naccelerators is an active field of research that can greatly benefit from the\nresults of \\textit{ab initio} calculations for the characterization of the\nelectronic structure of target systems. As state-of-the-art many-body\nperturbation theory calculations are too expensive for large-scale material\nscreening, density functional theory offers the best compromise between\naccuracy and computational feasibility. The quality of the obtained results,\nhowever, crucially depends on the choice of the exchange-correlation potential,\n$v_{xc}$. To address this essential point, we systematically analyze the\nperformance of three popular approximations of $v_{xc}$ (PBE, SCAN, and HSE06)\non the structural and electronic properties of bulk Cs$_3$Sb and Cs$_2$Te, two\nrepresentative materials of Cs-based semiconductors employed in photocathode\napplications. Among the adopted approximations, PBE shows expectedly the\nlargest discrepancies from the target: the unit cell volume is overestimated\ncompared to the experimental value, while the band gap is severely\nunderestimated. On the other hand, both SCAN and HSE06 perform remarkably well\nin reproducing both structural and electronic properties. Spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich mainly impacts the valence region of both materials inducing a band\nsplitting and, consequently, a band-gap reduction of the order of 0.2 eV, is\nequally captured by all functionals.

    "abstract": "The training set of atomic configurations is key to the performance of any\nMachine Learning Force Field (MLFF) and, as such, the training set selection\ndetermines the applicability of the MLFF model for predictive molecular\nsimulations. However, most atomistic reference datasets are inhomogeneously\ndistributed across configurational space (CS), thus choosing the training set\nrandomly or according to the probability distribution of the data leads to\nmodels whose accuracy is mainly defined by the most common close-to-equilibrium\nconfigurations in the reference data. In this work, we combine unsupervised and\nsupervised ML methods to bypass the inherent bias of the data for common\nconfigurations, effectively widening the applicability range of MLFF to the\nfullest capabilities of the dataset. To achieve this goal, we first cluster the\nCS into subregions similar in terms of geometry and energetics. We iteratively\ntest a given MLFF performance on each subregion and fill the training set of\nthe model with the representatives of the most inaccurate parts of the CS. The\nproposed approach has been applied to a set of small organic molecules and\nalanine tetrapeptide, demonstrating an up to two-fold decrease in the root mean\nsquared errors for force predictions of these molecules. This result holds for\nboth kernel-based methods (sGDML and GAP/SOAP models) and deep neural networks\n(SchNet model). For the latter, the developed approach simultaneously improves\nboth energy and forces, bypassing the compromise to be made when employing\nmixed energy/force loss functions.",

    "abstract": "Compressed sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique that enables the\nefficient recovery of a sparse high-dimensional signal from low-dimensional\nmeasurements. In the multiple measurement vector (MMV) framework, a set of\nsignals with the same support must be recovered from their corresponding\nmeasurements. Here, we present the first exploration of the MMV problem where\nsignals are independently drawn from a sparse, multivariate Poisson\ndistribution. We are primarily motivated by a suite of biosensing applications\nof microfluidics where analytes (such as whole cells or biomarkers) are\ncaptured in small volume partitions according to a Poisson distribution. We\nrecover the sparse parameter vector of Poisson rates through maximum likelihood\nestimation with our novel Sparse Poisson Recovery (SPoRe) algorithm. SPoRe uses\nbatch stochastic gradient ascent enabled by Monte Carlo approximations of\notherwise intractable gradients. By uniquely leveraging the Poisson structure,\nSPoRe substantially outperforms a comprehensive set of existing and custom\nbaseline CS algorithms. Notably, SPoRe can exhibit high performance even with\none-dimensional measurements and high noise levels. This resource efficiency is\nnot only unprecedented in the field of CS but is also particularly potent for\napplications in microfluidics in which the number of resolvable measurements\nper partition is often severely limited. We prove the identifiability property\nof the Poisson model under such lax conditions, analytically develop insights\ninto system performance, and confirm these insights in simulated experiments.\nOur findings encourage a new approach to biosensing and are generalizable to\nother applications featuring spatial and temporal Poisson signals.",

    "abstract": "For distributed learning among collaborative users, this paper develops and\nanalyzes a communication-efficient scheme for federated learning (FL) over the\nair, which incorporates 1-bit compressive sensing (CS) into analog aggregation\ntransmissions. To facilitate design parameter optimization, we theoretically\nanalyze the efficacy of the proposed scheme by deriving a closed-form\nexpression for the expected convergence rate of the FL over the air. Our\ntheoretical results reveal the tradeoff between convergence performance and\ncommunication efficiency as a result of the aggregation errors caused by\nsparsification, dimension reduction, quantization, signal reconstruction and\nnoise. Then, we formulate 1-bit CS based FL over the air as a joint\noptimization problem to mitigate the impact of these aggregation errors through\njoint optimal design of worker scheduling and power scaling policy. An\nenumeration-based method is proposed to solve this non-convex problem, which is\noptimal but becomes computationally infeasible as the number of devices\nincreases. For scalable computing, we resort to the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) technique to develop an efficient implementation\nthat is suitable for large-scale networks.

Over 90% of the 150\nregions were detected in the J = 2-1 and 3-2 transitions of CS and 75% were\ndetected in the J=5-4 transition. We have combined the data with the J = 7-6\ndata from our original survey (Plume et al. 1992) to determine the density by\nanalyzing the excitation of the rotational levels. Using Large Velocity\nGradient (LVG) models, we have determined densities and column densities for 71\nof these regions. The gas densities are very high (the mean log of the density\nis 5.9), but much less than the critical density of the J=7-6 line. Small maps\nof 25 of the sources in the J = 5-4 line yield a mean diameter of 1.0 pc. The\nmean virial mass is 3800 solar masses. The mean ratio of bolometric luminosity\nto virial mass (L/M) is 190, about 50 times higher than estimates using CO\nemission, suggesting that star formation is much more efficient in the dense\ngas probed in this study. The gas depletion time for the dense gas is roughly\n1.3 x 10^7 yr. We find no statistically significant linewidth--size or\ndensity--size relationships in our data. Instead, both linewidth and density\nare larger for a given size than would be predicted by the usual relationships.\nWe find that the linewidth increases with density, the opposite of what would\nbe predicted by the usual arguments. We estimate that the luminosity of our\nGalaxy (excluding the inner 400 pc) in the CS J = 5-4 transition is 15 to 23\nL_sun, considerably less than the luminosity in this line within the central\n100 pc of NGC 253 and M82.

Molecules including CO and CS almost vanish near the core centers,\nwhere the abundance decreases by one or two orders of magnitude. At the same\ntime, N2H+ has a constant abundance, and the fraction of NH3 increases toward\nthe core center. Our conclusions are based on a study of 5 mostly-round\nstarless cores (L1498, L1495, L1400K, L1517B, and L1544), which we have\nmappedin C18O(1-0), C17O(1-0), CS(2-1), C34S(2-1), N2H+(1-0), NH3(1,1) and\n(2,2), and the 1.2 mm continuum. For each core we have built a model that fits\nsimultaneously the radial profile of all observed emission and the central\nspectrum for the molecular lines. The observed abundance drops of CO and CS are\nnaturally explained by the depletion of these molecules onto dust grains at\ndensities of 2-6 10^4 cm-3. N2H+ seems unaffected by this process up to\ndensities of several 10^5, while the NH3 abundance may be enhanced by reactions\ntriggered by the disappearance of CO from the gas phase. With the help of our\nmodels, we show that chemical differentiation automatically explains the\ndiscrepancy between the sizes of CS and NH3 maps, a problem which has remained\nunexplained for more than a decade. Our models, in addition, show that a\ncombination of radiative transfer effects can give rise to the previously\nobserved discrepancy in the linewidth of these two tracers. Although this\ndiscrepancy has been traditionally interpreted as resulting from a systematic\nincrease of the turbulent linewidth with radius, our models show that it can\narise in conditions of constant gas turbulence.",

A comparison of this CS(2-1) data and\nthe H92alpha recombination line data of Lang, Goss & Morris (2001) reveals that\nthe ionized and molecular gas are physically related, but that their velocities\nin this region differ by up to 35 km/s.

An overall comparison of the molecular and ionized gas across\nthe entire -30 km/s cloud based on the single dish CS(2-1) data and the\nH92alpha line data illustrates that such differences in velocity between the\nionized and molecular gas are common and that the geometrical arrangement of\nthese components is complicated.

Cores with high\ntemperature and high molecular hydrogen density are needed to match the higher\ntransitions (e.g. J=7-6) observed towards A and G. The lower temperature, low\ndensity gas needed to create the inverse P-Cygni profile seen in the CS J=2-1\nline (with 5\" beam) towards H II region G arises from different components in\nthe 3 models. The infalling envelope of cloud G plus cloud B creates the\nabsorption in global collapse, cloud B is responsible in local collapse, and a\nseparate cloud, G', is needed in the case of many static clouds. The exact\nnature of the velocity field in the envelopes for the case of local collapse is\nnot important as long as it is in the range of 1 to 5 km/s for a turbulent\nvelocity of about 6 km/s. High resolution observations of the J=1-0 and 5-4\ntransitions of CS and C34S may distinguish between these three models. Modeling\nexisting observations of HCO+ and C18O does not allow one to distinguish\nbetween the three models but does indicate the existence of a bipolar outflow.",

    "abstract": "In a previous paper we were able to measure the abundance of uranium and\nthorium in the very-metal poor halo giant BPS CS 31082-001, but only obtained\nan upper limit for the abundance of lead (Pb). We have got from ESO 17 hours of\nadditional exposure on this star in order to secure a detection of the minimum\namount of lead expected to be present in CS 31082-001, the amount arising from\nthe decay of the original content of Th and U in the star. We report here this\nsuccessful detection. We find an LTE abundance log(Pb/H)+12=-0.55 \\pm 0.15 dex,\none dex below the upper limits given by other authors for the similar stars CS\n22892-052 and BD +17d3248, also enhanced in r-process elements. From the\nobserved present abundances of Th and U in the star, the expected amount of Pb\nproduced by the decay of 232Th, and 238U alone, over 12-15 Gyr is -0.73\\pm 0.17\ndex. The decay of 235U is more difficult to estimate, but is probably slightly\nbelow the contribution of 238U, making the contribution of the 3 actinides only\nslightly below, or even equal to, the measured abundance. The contribution from\nthe decay of 234U has was not included, for lack of published data. In this\nsense our determination is a lower limit to the contribution of actinides to\nlead production. We comment this result, and we note that if a NLTE analysis,\nnot yet possible, doubles our observed abundance, the decay of the 3 actinides\nwill still represent 50 per cent of the total lead, a proportion higher than\nthe values considered so far in the literature.",

Using a\nflared disk model with a vertical temperature gradient and an isothermal\nspherical envelope model with a shadowed midplane and two unshielded cones\ntogether with a gas-grain chemical network, time-dependent abundances of\nobservationally important molecules are calculated. Then a 2D non-LTE line\nradiative transfer code is applied to compute excitation temperatures of\nseveral rotational transitions of HCO$^+$, CO, C$^{18}$O, and CS molecules.

    "abstract": "We present the results of an abundance analysis for a sample of stars with\n$-4<$[Fe/H]$<-2$. The data were obtained with the HIRES spectrograph at Keck\nObservatory. The set includes 28 stars, with effective temperature ranging from\n4800 to 6600 K. For 13 stars with [Fe/H]$<-2.6$, including nine with\n[Fe/H]$<-3.0$ and one with [Fe/H]$=-4.0$, these are the first reported detailed\nabundances. For the most metal-poor star in our sample, CS 30336-049, we\nmeasure an abundance pattern that is very similar to stars in the range\n[Fe/H]$\\sim-3.5$, including a normal C+N abundance. We also find that it has\nvery low but measurable Sr and Ba, indicating some neutron-capture activity\neven at this low of a metallicity. We explore this issue further by examining\nother very neutron-capture-deficient stars, and find that at the lowest levels,\n[Ba/Sr] exhibits the ratio of the main r-process. We also report on a new\nr-process-enhanced star, CS 31078-018. This star has [Fe/H]$=-2.85$,\n[Eu/Fe]$=1.23$, and [Ba/Eu]$=-0.51$. CS 31078-018 exhibits an ``actinide\nboost'', i.e. much higher [Th/Eu] than expected and at a similar level to CS\n31082-001. Our spectra allow us to further constrain the abundance scatter at\nlow metallicities, which we then use to fit to the zero-metallicity Type II\nsupernova yields of Heger & Woosley (2008). We find that supernovae with\nprogenitor masses between 10 and 20 M$_{\\odot}$ provide the best matches to our\nabundances.",

The crystal data of Cs$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$ synthesized\nfirst in the present work are reported. We performed magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements on this family of Kagome antiferromagnet using single crystals.

The\nmagnetic susceptibilities observed for $T > T_t$ are almost perfectly described\nusing theoretical results obtained by exact diagonalization for the 24-site\nKagome cluster with $J/k_B = 244$ K, 266 K and 240 K, respectively. Magnetic\nordering accompanied by the weak ferromagnetic moment occurs at $T_N = 23.5$ K,\n24.5 K and 20.0 K, respectively. The origins of the weak ferromagnetic moment\nshould be ascribed to the lattice distortion that breaks the hexagonal symmetry\nof the exchange network for $T < T_t$ and the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction.\nRb$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$ is magnetically described as a modified Kagome\nantiferromagnet with four types of neighboring exchange interaction. Neither\nstructural nor magnetic phase transition was observed in\nRb$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$. Its magnetic ground state was found to be a spin\nsinglet with a triplet gap. Using exact diagonalization for a 12-site Kagome\ncluster, we analyzed the magnetic susceptibility and evaluated individual\nexchange interactions.

The knots are found at distances of 2.2'-6.4'\nfrom the central star (CS). At the inner edge and in the inner ring (up to 4.5'\nfromthe CS), the knot often show a `tadpole' shape, an elliptical head with a\nbright crescent inside and a long tail opposite to the CS. In detail, there are\nvariations in the tadpole shapes, such as narrowing tails, widening tails,\nmeandering tails, or multi-peaks within a tail. In the outer ring (4.5'-6.4'\nfrom the CS), the shapes are more fractured, and the tails do not collimate\ninto a single direction. The transition in knot morphology from the inner edge\nto the outer ring is clearly seen. The number density of knots governs the H2\nsurface brightness in the inner ring: H2 exists only within the knots. Possible\nmechanisms which contribute to the shaping of the knots are discussed,\nincluding photo-ionization and streaming motions. A plausible interpretation of\nour images is that inner knots are being overrun by a faster wind, but that\nthis has not (yet) reached the outer knots. Based on H2 formation and\ndestruction rates, H2 gas can survive in knots from formation during the late\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase throughout the PN phase. These observations\nprovide new constraints on the formation and evolution of knots, and on the\nphysics of molecular gas embedded within ionized gas.",

The analysis is based on high-quality VLT/UVES spectra and MARCS\nmodel atmospheres. We detect lines of 15 heavy elements in the spectrum of CS\n29491-069, and 18 in HE 1219-0312; in both cases including the Th II 4019 {\\AA}\nline. The heavy-element abundance patterns of these two stars are mostly\nwell-matched to scaled solar residual abundances not formed by the s-process.\nWe also compare the observed pattern with recent high-entropy wind (HEW)\ncalculations, which assume core-collapse supernovae of massive stars as the\nastrophysical environment for the r-process, and find good agreement for most\nlanthanides. The abundance ratios of the lighter elements strontium, yttrium,\nand zirconium, which are presumably not formed by the main r-process, are\nreproduced well by the model. Radioactive dating for CS 29491-069 with the\nobserved thorium and rare-earth element abundance pairs results in an average\nage of 9.5 Gyr, when based on solar r-process residuals, and 17.6 Gyr, when\nusing HEW model predictions. Chronometry seems to fail in the case of HE\n1219-0312, resulting in a negative age due to its high thorium abundance. HE\n1219-0312 could therefore exhibit an overabundance of the heaviest elements,\nwhich is sometimes called an \"actinide boost\".",

In the dynamical theory, the scalar field is itself\nsourced by the Pontryagin density of the space-time. In this paper, the coupled\nsystem of equations for the metric and the scalar field is solved numerically\nfor slowly-rotating neutron stars described with realistic equations of state\nand for slowly-rotating black holes. An analytic solution for a\nconstant-density nonrelativistic object is also presented. It is shown that the\nblack hole solution cannot be used to describe the exterior spacetime of a star\nas was previously assumed. In addition, whereas previous analysis were limited\nto the small-coupling regime, this paper considers arbitrarily large coupling\nstrengths. It is found that the CS modification leads to two effects on the\ngravitomagnetic sector of the metric: (i) Near the surface of a star or the\nhorizon of a black hole, the magnitude of the gravitomagnetic potential is\ndecreased and frame-dragging effects are reduced in comparison to GR. (ii) In\nthe case of a star, the angular momentum J, as measured by distant observers,\nis enhanced in CS gravity as compared to standard GR. For a large coupling\nstrength, the near-zone frame-dragging effects become significantly screened,\nwhereas the far-zone enhancement saturate at a maximum value max(Delta J) ~\n(M/R) J.

    "title": "NMR study of the Superconducting gap variation near the Mott transition\n  in Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$",
    "abstract": "Former extensive studies of superconductivity in the \\textit{A}$_{3}$C$_{60}$\ncompounds, where \\textit{A} is an alkali, have led to consider that Bardeen\nCooper Schrieffer (BCS) electron-phonon pairing prevails in those compounds,\nthough the incidence of electronic Coulomb repulsion has been highly debated.\nThe discovery of two isomeric fulleride compounds Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$ which\nexhibit a transition with pressure from a Mott insulator (MI) to a\nsuperconducting (SC) state clearly re-opens that question. Using pressure ($p$)\nas a single control parameter of the C$_{60}$ balls lattice spacing, one can\nnow study the progressive evolution of the SC properties when the electronic\ncorrelations are increased towards the critical pressure $p_{c}$ of the Mott\ntransition. We have used $^{13}$C and $^{133}$Cs NMR measurements on the cubic\nphase A15-Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$ just above $p_{c}=5.0(3)$ kbar, where the SC\ntransition temperature $T_{c}$ displays a dome shape with decreasing cell\nvolume. From the $T$ dependence below $T_{c}$ of the nuclear spin lattice\nrelaxation rate $(T_{1})^{-1}$ we determine the electronic excitations in the\nSC state, that is $2\\Delta$, the SC gap value. We find that $2\\Delta $\nincreases with decreasing $p$ towards $p_{c}$, where $T_{c}$ decreases on the\nSC dome, so that $2\\Delta /k_{B}T_{c}$ increases regularly upon approaching the\nMott transition. These results bring clear evidence that the increasing\ncorrelations near the Mott transition are not significantly detrimental to SC.\nThey rather suggest that repulsive electron interactions might even reinforce\nelecron-phonon SC, being then partly responsible for the large $T_{c}$ values,\nas proposed by theoretical models taking the electronic correlations as a key\ningredient.",

    "abstract": "The Convected Scheme (CS) is a `forward-trajectory' semi-Lagrangian method\nfor solution of transport equations, which has been most often applied to the\nkinetic description of plasmas and rarefied neutral gases. In its simplest\nform, the CS propagates the solution by advecting the `moving cells' along\ntheir characteristic trajectories, and by remapping them on the mesh at the end\nof the time step. The CS is conservative, positivity preserving, simple to\nimplement, and not subject to time step restriction to maintain stability.\nRecently [Y. G\\\"u\\c{c}l\\\"u and W.N.G. Hitchon, 2012] a new methodology was\nintroduced for reducing numerical diffusion, based on a modified equation\nanalysis: the remapping error was compensated by applying small corrections to\nthe final position of the moving cells prior to remapping. While the spatial\naccuracy was increased from 2nd to 4th order, the new scheme retained the\nimportant properties of the original method, and was shown to be simple and\nefficient for constant advection problems. Here the CS is applied to the\nsolution of the Vlasov-Poisson system: the Vlasov equation is split into two\nconstant advection equations, one in configuration space and one in velocity\nspace, and high order time accuracy is achieved by proper composition of the\noperators. The splitting procedure enables us to use the constant advection\nsolver, which we extend to arbitrarily high order of accuracy: a new improved\nprocedure is given, which makes the calculation of the corrections\nstraightforward. Focusing on periodic domains, we describe a spectrally\naccurate scheme based on the fast Fourier transform; the proposed\nimplementation is strictly conservative and positivity preserving. The ability\nto correctly reproduce the system dynamics, as well as resolving small-scale\nfeatures in the solution, is shown in classical 1D-1V test cases, both in the\nlinear and the non-linear regimes.",

We study the\ngeneral systems described by PHA: for zeroth- and first-order we obtain the\nharmonic and radial oscillators, respectively; for second- and third-order PHA,\nthe potential is determined in terms of solutions to Painlev\\'e IV and V\nequations ($P_{IV}$ and $P_{V}$), respectively.\n  Later on, we review the six Painlev\\'e equations and we study the cases of\n$P_{IV}$ and $P_V$. We prove a reduction theorem for $2k$th-order PHA to be\nreduced to second-order algebras. We also prove an analogous theorem for the\n$(2k+1)$th-order PHA to be reduced to third-order ones.

Since these systems have third-order ladder\noperators $l_k^\\pm$, we seek first the CS as eigenstates of the annihilation\noperator $l_k^-$. We also define operators analogous to the displacement\noperator and we get CS departing from the extremal states in each subspace in\nwhich the Hilbert space is decomposed.

Our\nanalysis is based on high signal-to-noise, high-resolution (R~75000) VLT/UVES\nspectra and MARCS model atmospheres under the assumption of local thermodynamic\nequilibrium, and obtains abundance measurements for a total of 46 elements, 31\nof which are neutron-capture elements.

Uranium is also detected (log e(U)\n=-2.20+/-0.30), albeit with a large measurement error that hampers its use as a\nprecision cosmo-chronometer.

    "abstract": "We have mapped over 50 massive, dense clumps with four dense gas tracers: HCN\nJ=1-0 and 3-2; and CS J=2-1 and 7-6 transitions. Spectral lines of optically\nthin H^{13}CN 3-2 and C^{34}S 5-4 were also obtained towards the map centers.\nThese maps usually demonstrate single well-peaked distributions at our\nresolution, even with higher J transitions. The size, virial mass, surface\ndensity, and mean volume density within a well-defined angular size (FWHM) were\ncalculated from the contour maps for each transition. We found that transitions\nwith higher effective density usually trace the more compact, inner part of the\nclumps but have larger linewidths, leading to an inverse linewidth-size\nrelation using different tracers. The mean surface densities are 0.29, 0.33,\n0.78, 1.09 g cm^{-2} within FWHM contours of CS 2-1, HCN 1-0, HCN 3-2 and CS\n7-6, respectively. We find no correlation of L_{IR} with surface density and a\npossible inverse correlation with mean volume density, contrary to some\ntheoretical expectations. We see no evidence in the data for the relation\nbetween L'_{mol} and mean density posited by modelers.\n  The correlation between L'_{mol} and the virial mass is roughly linear for\neach dense gas tracer. A nearly linear correlation was found between the\ninfrared luminosity and the line luminosity of all dense gas tracers for these\nmassive, dense clumps, with a lower cutoff in luminosity at L_{IR}=10^{4.5}\nLsun. The L_{IR}-L'_{HCN1-0} correlation agrees well with the one found in\ngalaxies. These correlations indicate a constant star formation rate per unit\nmass from the scale of dense clumps to that of distant galaxies when the mass\nis measured for dense gas. These results support the suggestion that starburst\ngalaxies may be understood as having a large fraction of gas in dense clumps.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a memory efficient VLSI architecture of low complex video\nencoder using three dimensional (3-D) wavelet and Compressed Sensing (CS) is\nproposed for space and low power video applications. Majority of the\nconventional video coding schemes are based on hybrid model, which requires\ncomplex operations like transform coding (DCT), motion estimation and\ndeblocking filter at the encoder. Complexity of the proposed encoder is reduced\nby replacing those complex operations by 3-D DWT and CS at the encoder. The\nproposed architecture uses 3-D DWT to enable the scalability with levels of\nwavelet decomposition and also to exploit the spatial and the temporal\nredundancies. CS provides the good error resilience and coding efficiency. At\nthe first stage of the proposed architecture for encoder, 3-D DWT has been\napplied (Lifting based 2-D DWT in spatial domain and Haar wavelet in temporal\ndomain) on each frame of the group of frames (GOF), and in the second stage CS\nmodule exploits the sparsity of the wavelet coefficients. Small set of linear\nmeasurements are extracted by projecting the sparse 3-D wavelet coefficients\nonto random Bernoulli matrix at the encoder. Compared with the best existing\n3-D DWT architectures, the proposed architecture for 3-D DWT requires less\nmemory and provide high throughput. For an N?N image, the proposed 3-D DWT\narchitecture consumes a total of only 2?(3N +40P) words of on-chip memory for\nthe one level of decomposition.

    "abstract": "Compressed sensing (CS) exploits the sparsity of a signal in order to\nintegrate acquisition and compression. CS theory enables exact reconstruction\nof a sparse signal from relatively few linear measurements via a suitable\nnonlinear minimization process. Conventional CS theory relies on vectorial data\nrepresentation, which results in good compression ratios at the expense of\nincreased computational complexity. In applications involving color images,\nvideo sequences, and multi-sensor networks, the data is intrinsically of\nhigh-order, and thus more suitably represented in tensorial form. Standard\napplications of CS to higher-order data typically involve representation of the\ndata as long vectors that are in turn measured using large sampling matrices,\nthus imposing a huge computational and memory burden. In this chapter, we\nintroduce Generalized Tensor Compressed Sensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for\ncompressed sensing of higher-order tensors which preserves the intrinsic\nstructure of tensorial data with reduced computational complexity at\nreconstruction. We demonstrate that GTCS offers an efficient means for\nrepresentation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition\nand compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we propound two\nreconstruction procedures, a serial method (GTCS-S) and a parallelizable method\n(GTCS-P), both capable of recovering a tensor based on noiseless and noisy\nobservations. We then compare the performance of the proposed methods with\nKronecker compressed sensing (KCS) and multi-way compressed sensing (MWCS). We\ndemonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS and MWCS in terms of both\nreconstruction accuracy (within a range of compression ratios) and processing\nspeed. The major disadvantage of our methods (and of MWCS as well), is that the\nachieved compression ratios may be worse than those offered by KCS.",

Even slightly increased content of radiocesium was found\nat some eddies at depth of 1000 m.

In situ observations are compared with the results\nof simulated advection of these radioisotopes by the AVISO altimetric velocity\nfield. Different Lagrangian diagnostics are used to reconstruct the history and\norigin of synthetic tracers imitating measured seawater samples collected in\neach of those eddies.

The high spatial resolution of HST allows us to\nresolve these compact PNe and distinguish the CS emission from that of their\nsurrounding PNe.

Central star masses for 23\ntargets were derived by placing the stars on a temperature-luminosity diagram\nand compare their location with the best available single star post-AGB\nevolutionary tracks, the remaining masses were indeterminate most likely\nbecause of underestimates of the stellar temperature, or because of substantial\nerrors in the adopted statistical distances to these objects. The distribution\nof CS masses in the sample of compact PNe is different than sample in the LMC\nand SMC, but with a median mass of 0.59 solar masses it is similar to other\nGalactic samples. We conclude that the compact nature of many of the PNe is a\nresult of their large distance, rather than their physical dimension.",

    "abstract": "Context. NGC 40 is a planetary nebula with diffuse X-ray emission, suggesting\nan interaction of the high speed wind from WC8 central star (CS) with the\nnebula. It shows strong Civ 1550 {\\AA} emission that cannot be explained by\nthermal processes alone. We present here the first map of this nebula in C IV\nemission, using broad band filters on the UVIT.\n  Aims. To map the hot C IV emitting gas and its correspondence with soft X-ray\n(0.3-8 keV) emitting regions, in order to study the shock interaction with the\nnebula and the ISM. This also illustrates the potential of UVIT for nebular\nstudies.\n  Methods. Morphological study of images of the nebula obtained at an angular\nresolution of about 1.3\" in four UVIT filter bands that include C IV 1550 {\\AA}\nand C II] 2326 {\\AA} lines and UV continuum. Comparisons with X-ray, optical,\nand IR images from literature.\n  Results. The C II] 2326 {\\AA} images show the core of the nebula with two\nlobes on either side of CS similar to [N II]. The C IV emission in the core\nshows similar morphology and extant as that of diffuse X-ray emission\nconcentrated in nebular condensations. A surprising UVIT discovery is the\npresence of a large faint FUV halo in FUV Filter with {\\lambda}eff of 1608\n{\\AA}. The UV halo is not present in any other UV filter. FUV halo is most\nlikely due to UV fluorescence emission from the Lyman bands of H2 molecules.\nUnlike the optical and IR halo, FUV halo trails predominantly towards\nsouth-east side of the nebular core, opposite to the CS's proper motion\ndirection.\n  Conclusions. Morphological similarity of C IV 1550 {\\AA} and X-ray emission\nin the core suggests that it results mostly from interaction of strong CS wind\nwith the nebula. The FUV halo in NGC 40 highlights the existence of H2\nmolecules extensively in the regions even beyond the optical and IR halos.",

The aim of this work is to investigate\nthe structure and kinematics of the CS disc of the B[e] SG LHA 120-S 35. We\nused high-resolution optical spectra obtained in different years to model the\nforbidden emission lines and determine the kinematical properties of their\nline-forming regions, assuming Keplerian rotation. We also used low-resolution\nnear-infrared (IR) spectra to explore the variability of molecular emission.\nLHA 120-S 35 displays spectral variability in both optical and IR regions. The\nP-Cygni line profiles of H I, as well as those of Fe II and O I, suggest the\npresence of a strong bipolar clumped wind. We distinguish density enhancements\nin the P-Cygni absorption component of the first Balmer lines, which show\nvariations in both velocity and strength. The P-Cygni profile emission\ncomponent is double-peaked, indicating the presence of a rotating CS disc. We\nalso observe line-profile variations in the permitted and forbidden features of\nFe II and O I. In the IR, we detect variations in the intensity of the H I\nemission lines as well as in the emission of the CO band-heads. Moreover, we\nfind that the profiles of each [Ca II] and [O I] emission lines contain\ncontributions from spatially different (complete or partial) rings. Globally,\nwe find evidence of detached multi-ring structures, revealing density\nvariations along the disc. We suggest that LHA 120-S 35 has passed through the\nred-supergiant (RSG) phase and evolves back bluewards in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. The formation of the complex CS structure could be\nthe result of the wind-wind interactions of the post-RSG wind with the\npreviously ejected material from the RSG. However, the presence of a binary\ncompanion can not be excluded. Finally, we find that LHA 120-S 35 belongs to a\nyoung stellar cluster.",

Maps of 10 sources in both lines were obtained. For the remaining\nsources a map in just one line or a single-point spectrum were obtained. On the\nbasis of newly obtained and published observational data we consider the\nrelation between velocities of the \"quasi-thermal\" CS(2-1) line and 6.7 GHz\nmethanol maser line in 24 high-mass star-forming regions in the Perseus arm.

We suggest that the predominance of the \"red-shifted\nmasers\" in the Perseus arm could be related to the alignment of gas flows\ncaused by the large-scale motions in the Galaxy. Large-scale galactic shock\nrelated to the spiral structure is supposed to affect the local kinematics of\nthe star-forming regions. Part of the Perseus arm, between galactic longitudes\nfrom 85deg to 124deg, does not contain blue-shifted masers at all. Radial\nvelocities of the sources are the greatest in this particular part of the arm,\nso the velocity difference is clearly pronounced. 13CO(1-0) and CS(2-1)\nvelocity maps of G183.35-0.58 show gas velocity difference between the center\nand the periphery of the molecular clump up to 1.2 km/s. Similar situation is\nlikely to occur in G85.40-0.00.

We report the first detection of CS in comet ISON obtained with\nthe ALMA array and derive a parent scale length for CS of ~200 km. Due to the\nhigh spatial resolution of ALMA, resulting in a synthesised beam with a size\nslightly smaller than the derived parent scale length, we are able to\ntentatively identify CS as a daughter species, i.e., a species produced in the\ncoma and/or sublimated from icy grains, rather than a parent species.

    "abstract": "Fourier Transform Interferometry (FTI) is an appealing Hyperspectral (HS)\nimaging modality for many applications demanding high spectral resolution,\ne.g., in fluorescence microscopy. However, the effective resolution of FTI is\nlimited by the durability of biological elements when exposed to illuminating\nlight. Overexposed elements are subject to photo-bleaching and become unable to\nfluoresce. In this context, the acquisition of biological HS volumes based on\nsampling the Optical Path Difference (OPD) axis at Nyquist rate leads to\nunpleasant trade-offs between spectral resolution, quality of the HS volume,\nand light exposure intensity. We propose two variants of the FTI imager, i.e.,\nCoded Illumination-FTI (CI-FTI) and Structured Illumination FTI (SI-FTI), based\non the theory of compressive sensing (CS). These schemes efficiently modulate\nlight exposure temporally (in CI-FTI) or spatiotemporally (in SI-FTI).\nLeveraging a variable density sampling strategy recently introduced in CS, we\nprovide near-optimal illumination strategies, so that the light exposure\nimposed on a biological specimen is minimized while the spectral resolution is\npreserved. Our analysis focuses on two criteria: (i) a trade-off between\nexposure intensity and the quality of the reconstructed HS volume for a given\nspectral resolution; (ii) maximizing HS volume quality for a fixed spectral\nresolution and constrained exposure budget. Our contributions can be adapted to\nan FTI imager without hardware modifications. The reconstruction of HS volumes\nfrom CS-FTI measurements relies on an $l_1$-norm minimization problem promoting\na spatiospectral sparsity prior. Numerically, we support the proposed methods\non synthetic data and simulated CS measurements (from actual FTI measurements)\nunder various scenarios. In particular, the biological HS volumes can be\nreconstructed with a three-to-ten-fold reduction in the light exposure.",

There is a tentative trend of a decline in the HCO$^{+}$ and H$_{2}$CO\nabundances with decreasing bolometric luminosity, while the CS and CO\nabundances show no particular difference between the proto-BDs and protostars.\nThese trends reflect the scaled-down physical structures for the proto-BDs\ncompared to protostars and differences in the peak emitting regions for these\nspecies. The C$^{17}$O isotopologue is detected in all of the proto-BDs as well\nas the more evolved Class Flat/Class II BDs in our sample, and can probe the\nquiescent gas at both early and late evolutionary stages.",

    "abstract": "For two-dimensional topological insulators, the integer and intrinsic\n(without external magnetic field) quantum Hall effect is described by the gauge\nanomalous (2+1)-dimensional [2+1d] Chern-Simons (CS) response for the\nbackground gauge potential of the electromagnetic U(1) field. The Hall\nconductance is given by the quantized prefactor of the CS term, which is a\nmomentum-space topological invariant. Here, we show that three-dimensional\ncrystalline topological insulators with no other symmetries are described by a\ntopological (3+1)-dimensional [3+1d] mixed CS term. In addition to the\nelectromagnetic U(1) gauge field, this term contains elasticity tetrad fields\n$E^{\\ a}_{\\mu}({\\bf r},t) = \\partial_{\\mu}X^a(\\mathbf{r},t)$ which are\ngradients of crystalline U(1) phase fields $X^a(\\mathbf{r},t)$ and describe the\ndeformations of the crystal. For a crystal in three spatial dimensions\n$a=1,2,3$ and the mixed axial-gravitational response contains three parameters\nprotected by crystalline symmetries: the weak momentum-space topological\ninvariants. The response of the Hall conductance to the deformations of the\ncrystal is quantized in terms of these invariants. In the presence of\ndislocations, the anomalous 3+1d CS term describes the Callan-Harvey anomaly\ninflow mechanism. The response can be extended to all odd spatial dimensions.\nThe elasticity tetrads, being the gradients of the lattice U(1) fields, have\ncanonical dimension of inverse length. Similarly, if such tetrad fields enter\ngeneral relativity, the metric becomes dimensionful, but the physical\nparameters, such as Newton's constant, the cosmological constant, and masses of\nparticles, become dimensionless.",

Specifically, our\nsynthesizer generates mp-MRI data in a sequential manner: first generating ADC\nmaps from 128-d latent vectors, followed by translating them to the T2w images.\nThe synthesizer is trained in a semisupervised manner. In the supervised\ntraining process, a limited amount of paired ADC-T2w images and the\ncorresponding ADC encodings are provided and the synthesizer learns the paired\nrelationship by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between\nsynthetic and real images. To avoid overfitting limited ADC encodings, an\nunlimited amount of random latent vectors and unpaired ADC-T2w Images are\nutilized in the unsupervised training process for learning the marginal image\ndistributions of real images. To improve the robustness of synthesizing, we\ndecompose the difficult task of generating full-size images into several\nsimpler tasks which generate sub-images only. A StitchLayer is then employed to\nfuse sub-images together in an interlaced manner into a full-size image. To\nenforce the synthetic images to indeed contain distinguishable CS PCa lesions,\nwe propose to also maximize an auxiliary distance of Jensen-Shannon divergence\n(JSD) between CS and nonCS images. Experimental results show that our method\ncan effectively synthesize a large variety of mpMRI images which contain\nmeaningful CS PCa lesions, display a good visual quality and have the correct\npaired relationship.

Here we\npresent ALMA observations at subarsecond resolution, complemented with IRAM-30m\ndata, of several lines of SiO, SiS, and CS towards the best-studied AGB\ncircumstellar envelope, IRC+10216. We aim to characterise their spatial\ndistribution and determine their fractional abundances mainly through radiative\ntransfer and chemical modelling. The three species display extended emission\nwith several enhanced emission shells. CS displays the most extended\ndistribution reaching distances up to approximately 20''. SiS and SiO emission\nhave similar sizes of approximately 11'', but SiS emission is slightly more\ncompact. We have estimated fractional abundances relative to H$_2$, which on\naverage are equal to f(SiO)$\\sim$10$^{-7}$, f(SiS)$\\sim$10$^{-6}$, and\nf(CS)$\\sim$10$^{-6}$ up to the photo-dissociation region.

Frame-by-frame processing of such enormous amount of data\nrequires hefty computational resources. In recent years, compressive sensing\napproaches have shown impressive results in signal processing by reducing the\nsampling bandwidth. Different sampling mechanisms were developed to incorporate\ncompressive sensing in image and video acquisition. Pixel-wise coded exposure\nis one among the promising sensing paradigms for capturing videos in the\ncompressed domain, which was also realized into an all-CMOS sensor\n\\cite{Xiong2017}. Though cameras that perform compressive sensing save a lot of\nbandwidth at the time of sampling and minimize the memory required to store\nvideos, we cannot do much in terms of processing until the videos are\nreconstructed to the original frames. But, the reconstruction of\ncompressive-sensed (CS) videos still takes a lot of time and is also\ncomputationally expensive. In this work, we show that object detection and\nlocalization can be possible directly on the CS frames (easily upto 20x\ncompression). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of\nobject detection and localization on CS frames has been attempted. Hence, we\nalso created a dataset for training in the CS domain. We were able to achieve a\ngood accuracy of 46.27\\% mAP(Mean Average Precision) with the proposed model\nwith an inference time of 23ms directly on the compressed frames(approx. 20\noriginal domain frames), this facilitated for real-time inference which was\nverified on NVIDIA TX2 embedded board. Our framework will significantly reduce\nthe communication bandwidth, and thus reduction in power as the video\ncompression will be done at the image sensor processing core.",

In this paper, we employ large-scale Langevin dynamics simulations\nto investigate how the diffusion of a tracer is influenced by the combined\naction of excluded-volume and weak attractive crowder-tracer interactions. We\nconsider two species of tracers, standard hard-core particles described by the\nWeeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) repulsive potential and core-softened (CS)\nparticles, which model, e.g., globular proteins, charged colloids and\nnanoparticles covered by polymeric brushes. These systems are characterized by\nthe presence of two length scales in the interaction and can show water-like\nanomalies in their diffusion, stemming from the inherent competition between\ndifferent length scales. Here we report a comprehensive study of both diffusion\nand structure of these two tracer species in an environment crowded by quenched\nconfigurations of polymers at increasing density. We analyze in detail how the\ntracer-polymer affinity and the system density affect transport as compared to\nthe emergence of specific static spatial correlations. In particular, we find\nthat, while hardly any differences emerge in the diffusion properties of WCA\nand CS particles, the propensity to develop structural order for large crowding\nis strongly frustrated for CS particles. Surprisingly, for large enough\naffinity for the crowding matrix, the diffusion coefficient of WCA tracers\ndisplay a non-monotonic trend as their density is increased when compared to\nthe zero affinity scenario. This water-like anomaly turns out to be even larger\nthan what observed for CS particle and appears to be rooted in a similar\ncompetition between excluded-volume and affinity effects.",

Specifically, we first introduce CS-based and CS\nclustering-based decentralized federated energy learning (DFEL) approaches\nwhich enable the CSs to train their own energy transactions locally to predict\nenergy demands. In this way, each CS can exchange its learned model with other\nCSs to improve prediction accuracy without revealing actual datasets and reduce\ncommunication overhead among the CSs. Based on the energy demand prediction, we\nthen design a multi-principal one-agent (MPOA) contract-based method. In\nparticular, we formulate the CSs' utility maximization as a non-collaborative\nenergy contract problem in which each CS maximizes its utility under common\nconstraints from the smart grid provider (SGP) and other CSs' contracts. Then,\nwe prove the existence of an equilibrium contract solution for all the CSs and\ndevelop an iterative algorithm at the SGP to find the equilibrium. Through\nsimulation results using the dataset of CSs' transactions in Dundee city, the\nUnited Kingdom between 2017 and 2018, we demonstrate that our proposed method\ncan achieve the energy demand prediction accuracy improvement up to 24.63% and\nlessen communication overhead by 96.3% compared with other machine learning\nalgorithms.

We performed excitation and radiative\ntransfer calculations based on the LVG method to model the observed lines of\nthe molecules and to derive their fractional abundances in the observed\nenvelopes.\n  Results:We detected SiO in all 30 targeted envelopes, as well as CS, SiS, SO,\nand SO$_2$ in 18, 13, 26, and 19 sources, respectively. Remarkably, SiS is not\ndetected in any envelope with a mass loss rate below $10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$, whereas it is detected in all envelopes with mass loss rates above\nthat threshold. From a comparison with a previous, similar study on C-rich\nsources, it becomes evident that the fractional abundances of CS and SiS show a\nmarked differentiation between C-rich and O-rich sources, being two orders of\nmagnitude and one order of magnitude more abundant in C-rich sources,\nrespectively, while the fractional abundance of SiO turns out to be insensitive\nto the C/O ratio. The abundance of SiO in O-rich envelopes behaves similarly to\nC-rich sources, that is, the denser the envelope the lower its abundance. A\nsimilar trend, albeit less clear than for SiO, is observed for SO in O-rich\nsources.\n  Conclusions: The marked dependence of CS and SiS abundances on the C/O ratio\nindicates that these two molecules form more efficiently in C- than O-rich\nenvelopes.

This\nmotivates the need for spatially resolved spectral observations of Class I\ndisks, as carried out by the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in\nTaurus (ALMA-DOT). In the context of ALMA-DOT, we observe the edge-on disk\naround the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247 (the butterfly star) in the 1.3mm\ncontinuum and five molecular lines. We report the first tentative detection of\nmethanol (CH$_3$OH) in a Class I disk and resolve, for the first time, the\nvertical structure of a disk with multiple molecular tracers. The bulk of the\nemission in the CO 2-1, CS 5-4, and o-H$_2$CO 3(1,2)-2(1,1) lines originates\nfrom the warm molecular layer, with the line intensity peaking at increasing\ndisk heights, $z$, for increasing radial distances, $r$. Molecular emission is\nvertically stratified, with CO observed at larger disk heights (aperture\n$z/r\\sim0.41-0.45$) compared to both CS and H$_2$CO, which are nearly cospatial\n($z/r\\sim0.21-0.28$). In the outer midplane, the line emission decreases due to\nmolecular freeze-out onto dust grains (freeze-out layer) by a factor of >100\n(CO) and 15 (CS). The H$_2$CO emission decreases by a factor of only about 2,\nwhich is possibly due to H$_2$CO formation on icy grains, followed by a\nnonthermal release into the gas phase. The inferred [CH$_3$OH]/[H$_2$CO]\nabundance ratio is 0.5-0.6, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than for\nClass 0 hot corinos, and a factor ~2.5 lower than the only other value inferred\nfor a protoplanetary disk (in TW Hya, 1.3-1.7). Additionally, it is at the\nlower edge but still consistent with the values in comets. This may indicate\nthat some chemical reprocessing occurs in disks before the formation of planets\nand comets.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 presents a great threat to public health worldwide and the\ninfectious agent SARS-CoV-2 is currently the target of much research aiming at\ninhibition. The virus' main protease is a dimeric enzyme that has only recently\nbegun to be thoroughly described, opening the door for virtual screening more\nbroadly. Here, a PAIN-filtered flavonoid database was screened against four\nsites of the protease: a free (normal) conformation of the Substrate Binding\nSite (NSBS), an induced-fit state of the SBS (ISBS), a Dimerization Site (DS)\nand a Cryptic Site (CS). The mean binding energies of the top five ligands from\neach site were -9.52, -11.512, -7.042 and -10.348 kcal/mol for the NSBS, the\nISBS, the DS and the CS, respectively. For the DS and CS, these top five\ncompounds were selected as candidates to bind their respective site. In the\ncase of SBS, the top 30 ligands with the lowest binding energies from NSBS and\nISBS were contrasted and the ones present in both lists were selected as the\nfinal candidates. The final list was: Dorsilurin E (FL3FQUNP0001), Euchrenone\na11 (FL2FALNP0014), Kurziflavolactone C (FL2FA9NC0016), Licorice glycoside E\n(FL2F1AGSN001) and Taxifolin 3'- (6\"-phenyl- acetylglucoside) (FL4DACGS0020)\nfor the SBS; Sanggenol O (FL2FALNP0020), CHEMBL2171573, Kanzonol E\n(FL3F1ANP0001), CHEMBL2171584 and Abyssynoflavanone VI (FL2FACNP0014) for DS\nand CHEMBL2171598, CHEMBL2171577, Denticulaflavanol (FL5FAANR0001),\nKurzichalcolactone (FL1CA9NC0001) and CHEMBL2171578 for CS. Virtual screening\nintegrated several confirmation methods, including cross-docking assays and\npositive and negative controls. All 15 compounds are currently subjected to\nmolecular dynamics so as to theoretically validate their binding to the\nprotease.",

We present measurements of\nthe carbon and sulphur abundances in the interstellar medium of the central\nregion of our Galaxy. The selected targets are the +50km/s Cloud and several\nl.o.s. clouds towards Sgr B2(N). Towards the +50km/s Cloud, we observed the\nJ=2-1 rotational transitions of CS, C34S, 13CS, C33S, and 13C34S, and the J=3-2\ntransitions of CS and C34S with the IRAM-30m telescope, as well as the J=6-5\ntransitions of C34S and 13CS with the APEX 12m telescope, all in emission. The\nJ=2-1 rotational transitions of CS, C34S, 13CS, and 13C34S were observed with\nALMA in the envelope of Sgr B2(N), with those of CS and C34S also observed in\nthe l.o.s. clouds towards Sgr B2(N), all in absorption. In the +50km/s Cloud we\nderive a 12C13C isotopic ratio of ~22.1, that leads, with the measured\n13CS/C34S line intensity ratio, to a 32S/34S ratio of 16.3+3.0-2.4. We also\nderive the 32S/34S isotopic ratio more directly from the two isotopologues 13CS\nand 13C34S, which leads to an independent 32S/34S estimation of 16.3+2.1-1.7\nand 17.9+-5.0 for the +50km/s Cloud and Sgr B2(N), respectively. We also obtain\na 34S/33S ratio of ~4.3 in the +50 km/s Cloud. Previous studies observed a\ndecreasing trend in the 32S/34S isotopic ratios when approaching the Galactic\ncentre. Our result indicates a termination of this tendency at least at a\ngalactocentric distance of 130-30+60 pc. This is at variance with findings\nbased on 12C/13C, 14N/15N and 18O/17O isotope ratios, where the above-mentioned\ntrend is observed to continue right to the central molecular zone. This can\nindicate a drop in the production of massive stars at the Galactic centre, in\nthe same line as recent metallicity gradient studies, and opens the work\ntowards a comparison with Galactic and stellar evolution models.",

We find a narrow S-wave singlet resonance at 5.057 eV of width 0.003\neV in the Ps-Rb system and at 5.067 eV of width 0.003 eV in the Ps-Cs system.\nSinglet P-wave resonances in both systems are found at 5.3 eV of width 0.4 eV.\nSinglet D-wave structures are found at 5.4 eV in both systems. The pronounced\nP- and D-wave resonances in these systems lead to easily detectable local\nminima in the low-energy elastic cross sections. We also report results for\nelastic and Ps-excitation cross sections for Ps scattering by Rb and Cs.",

    "abstract": "Using a source selection biased towards high mass star forming regions, we\nused a Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) code to calculate the H2 densities and CS\ncolumn densities for a sample of Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) 8 micron\ninfrared dark cores. Our average H2 density and CS column density were 1.14 x\n10e6 cm-3 and 1.21 x 10e13 cm-2 respectively. In addition, we have calculated\nthe Jeans mass and Virial mass for each core to get a better understanding of\ntheir gravitational stability. We found that core masses calculated from\nobservations of N2H+ J = 1-0 and C18O J = 1-0 by Ragan et al. 2006 (Paper 1)\nwere sufficient for collapse, though most regions are likely to form\nprotoclusters. We have explored the star-forming properties of the molecular\ngas within our sample and find some diversity which extends the range of\ninfrared dark clouds from very the massive clouds that will create large\nclusters, to clouds that are similar to some of our local counterparts (e.g.\nSerpens, Ophiuchus).",

If properly chosen, the number of\nmeasurements can be significantly smaller than the ambient dimension of the\nsignal and yet preserve the significant signal information. Interestingly, it\ncan be shown that random measurement schemes provide a near-optimal encoding in\nterms of the required number of measurements. In this report, we explore\nanother relatively unexplored, though often alluded to, advantage of using\nrandom matrices to acquire CS measurements. Specifically, we show that random\nmatrices are democractic, meaning that each measurement carries roughly the\nsame amount of signal information. We demonstrate that by slightly increasing\nthe number of measurements, the system is robust to the loss of a small number\nof arbitrary measurements. In addition, we draw connections to oversampling and\ndemonstrate stability from the loss of significantly more measurements.",

By applying compressive sensing (CS) at the receive\nnodes, the MIMO radar super-resolution can be achieved with far fewer\nobservations than conventional approaches.

Since the targets are sparse in\nthe angle-velocity space, target information can be extracted by solving an l1\nminimization problem. In this paper, the range information is exploited by\nintroducing step frequency to MIMO radar with CS. The proposed approach is able\nto achieve high range resolution and also improve the ambiguous velocity.\nHowever, joint angle-Doppler-range estimation requires discretization of the\nangle-Doppler-range space which causes a sharp rise in the computational burden\nof the l1 minimization problem.

Most of\ncurrent CS recovery algorithms are originally designed for one-dimensional (1D)\nsignal, while many practical signals are two-dimensional (2D). By utilizing 2D\nseparable sampling, 2D signal recovery problem can be converted into 1D signal\nrecovery problem so that ordinary 1D recovery algorithms, e.g. orthogonal\nmatching pursuit (OMP), can be applied directly. However, even with 2D\nseparable sampling, the memory usage and complexity at the decoder is still\nhigh. This paper develops a novel recovery algorithm called 2D-OMP, which is an\nextension of 1D-OMP. In the 2D-OMP, each atom in the dictionary is a matrix. At\neach iteration, the decoder projects the sample matrix onto 2D atoms to select\nthe best matched atom, and then renews the weights for all the already selected\natoms via the least squares. We show that 2D-OMP is in fact equivalent to\n1D-OMP, but it reduces recovery complexity and memory usage significantly.\nWhat's more important, by utilizing the same methodology used in this paper,\none can even obtain higher dimensional OMP (say 3D-OMP, etc.) with ease.",

A hardware-oriented\nviewpoint is advocated throughout, addressing practical constraints and\nexemplifying hardware realizations where relevant. It will appear as a chapter\nin a book on \"Compressed Sensing: Theory and Applications\" edited by Yonina\nEldar and Gitta Kutyniok.",

Underneath this sine wave is a secular trend implying a decrease\nin the 371.7-s pulsational period of Pdot = -1.9 x 10^-11, which we attribute\nto the evolution of the star through the H-R diagram. The sinusoidal variation\ncould be produced by the presence of a low-mass companion, with m sin i ~ 0.12\nMsun, orbiting the subdwarf B star at a distance of 20 Rsun.

Unlike conventional\nsuperhalogens which have a metal atom at the core surrounded by halogen atoms,\nthe superhalogens formed using the Wade-Mingos rule do not have to have either\nhalogen or metal atoms. We demonstrate this by using B12H13 and its\nisoelectronic cluster, CB11H12 as examples. We also show that while\nconventional superhalogens containing alkali atoms require at least two halogen\natoms, only one borane-like moiety is sufficient to render M(B12H12) (M=Li, Na,\nK, Rb, Cs) clusters superhalogen properties. In addition, hyperhalogens can be\nformed by using the above superhalogens as building blocks. Examples include\nM(B12H13)2 and M(C-B11H12)2 (M=Li - Cs).

    "abstract": "The fields of compressed sensing (CS) and matrix completion have shown that\nhigh-dimensional signals with sparse or low-rank structure can be effectively\nprojected into a low-dimensional space (for efficient acquisition or\nprocessing) when the projection operator achieves a stable embedding of the\ndata by satisfying the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). It has also been\nshown that such stable embeddings can be achieved for general Riemannian\nsubmanifolds when random orthoprojectors are used for dimensionality reduction.\nDue to computational costs and system constraints, the CS community has\nrecently explored the RIP for structured random matrices (e.g., random\nconvolutions, localized measurements, deterministic constructions). The main\ncontribution of this paper is to show that any matrix satisfying the RIP (i.e.,\nproviding a stable embedding for sparse signals) can be used to construct a\nstable embedding for manifold-modeled signals by randomizing the column signs\nand paying reasonable additional factors in the number of measurements. We\ndemonstrate this result with several new constructions for stable manifold\nembeddings using structured matrices. This result allows advances in efficient\nprojection schemes for sparse signals to be immediately applied to manifold\nsignal models.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of tracking (causally estimating) a time sequence of\nsparse spatial signals with changing sparsity patterns, as well as other\nunknown states, from a sequence of nonlinear observations corrupted by\n(possibly) non-Gaussian noise. In many applications, particularly those in\nvisual tracking, the unknown state can be split into a small dimensional part,\ne.g. global motion, and a spatial signal, e.g. illumination or shape\ndeformation. The spatial signal is often well modeled as being sparse in some\ndomain. For a long sequence, its sparsity pattern can change over time,\nalthough the changes are usually slow. To address the above problem, we propose\na novel solution approach called Particle Filtered Modified-CS (PaFiMoCS). The\nkey idea of PaFiMoCS is to importance sample for the small dimensional state\nvector, while replacing importance sampling by slow sparsity pattern change\nconstrained posterior mode tracking for recovering the sparse spatial signal.\nWe show that the problem of tracking moving objects across spatially varying\nillumination change is an example of the above problem and explain how to\ndesign PaFiMoCS for it. Experiments on both simulated data as well as on real\nvideos with significant illumination changes demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed algorithm as compared with existing particle filter based tracking\nalgorithms.",

The other part\narises due to the obscuration of the stellar photosphere and the closest\ncircumstellar area by the dusty CS disk. Comparison of our results with the\nprevious one, obtained by Lambert & Sawyer during the 1982-1984 eclipse,\nindicates the good agreement, and argues in favor of stability of the secondary\ndisk structure. On the base of the new observational data we provide a new mass\nestimation of the system components.",

    "abstract": "We analyze doubly magic trapping of Cs hyperfine transitions including\npreviously neglected contributions from the ground state hyperpolarizability\nand the interaction of the laser light and a static magnetic field. Extensive\nnumerical searches do not reveal any doubly magic trapping conditions for any\npair of hyperfine states. However, including the hyperpolarizability reveals\nlight intensity insensitive traps for a wide range of wavelengths at specific\nintensities. We then investigate the possibility of using bichromatic trapping\nlight fields.

    "abstract": "The anisotropic triangular model, which is believed to describe the materials\nCs$_2$CuCl$_4$ and Cs$_2$CuBr$_4$, among others, is dominated by incommensurate\nspiral physics and is thus extremely resistant to numerical analysis on small\nsystem sizes. In this paper we use twisted boundary conditions and exact\ndiagonalization techniques to study the phase diagram of this model. With these\nboundary conditions we are able to extract the inter- and intrachain ordering\n$q$-vectors for the $\\frac{J'}{J} < 1$ region finding very close agreement with\nrecent DMRG results on much larger systems. Our results suggest a phase\ntransition between a long-range incommensurate spiral ordered phase, and a more\nsubtle phase with short-range spiral correlations with the $q$-vector\ndescribing the incommensurate correlations varying smoothly through the\ntransition. In the latter phase correlations between next-nearest chains\nexhibits an extremely close competition between predominantly antiferromagnetic\nand ferromagnetic correlations. Further analysis suggests that the\nantiferromagnetic next-nearest chain correlations may be slightly stronger than\nthe ferromagnetic ones. This difference is found to be slight but in line with\nprevious renormalization group predictions of a collinear antiferromagnetic\nordering in this region.",

To minimize the\neffect of noise on the estimated CSI, we introduce a back-off strategy that\noptimally backs-off on the noisy estimated CSI and derive the error covariance\nmatrix of the post-detection noise. In addition to this, we provide exact\nclosed form expressions for the average maximum equivalent SNR at the\ndestination user.

For the transitions between rotational levels in\nH$_2$CS due to collisions with He atom, we have calculated cross sections under\nthe CS approximation. In the MOLSCAT, there is provision to input more than one\nvalues of total energies. Here, for example, we are interested in the cross\nsections for total energy 11 cm$^{-1}$. The calculations have been done for the\nsingle energy 11 cm$^{-1}$ and for eight combinations, having energies (11,\n12), (12, 11), (10, 11), (11, 10), (11, 12, 13), (9, 10, 11), (10, 11, 12), (9,\n10, 11, 12, 13) cm$^{-1}$. We have found that the cross sections for 11\ncm$^{-1}$, in general, differ from one another in all the 9 calculations. The\nreason for the difference in the results appears that the MOLSCAT uses the\nintermediate data of calculations for one energy, in the calculations for other\nenergies.

    "title": "Compressed Channel Feedback for Correlated Massive MIMO Systems",
    "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising approach for\ncellular communication due to its energy efficiency and high achievable data\nrate. These advantages, however, can be realized only when channel state\ninformation (CSI) is available at the transmitter. Since there are many\nantennas, CSI is too large to feed back without compression. To compress CSI,\nprior work has applied compressive sensing (CS) techniques and the fact that\nCSI can be sparsified. The adopted sparsifying bases fail, however, to reflect\nthe spatial correlation and channel conditions or to be feasible in practice.\nIn this paper, we propose a new sparsifying basis that reflects the long-term\ncharacteristics of the channel, and needs no change as long as the spatial\ncorrelation model does not change. We propose a new reconstruction algorithm\nfor CS, and also suggest dimensionality reduction as a compression method. To\nfeed back compressed CSI in practice, we propose a new codebook for the\ncompressed channel quantization assuming no other-cell interference. Numerical\nresults confirm that the proposed channel feedback mechanisms show better\nperformance in point-to-point (single-user) and point-to-multi-point\n(multi-user) scenarios.",

It has been noted that in the presence of input (signal) noise, the\napplication of the sensing matrix causes SNR degradation due to the noise\nfolding effect. In fact, it might also result in the variations of the output\nSNR in compressive measurements over the support of the input signal,\npotentially resulting in unexpected non-uniform system performance.

This electric field also\nenables resonances which do not respect the dipole-dipole selection rules under\nzero field. A few of these quasi-forbidden resonances have been observed but\nthey are often overlooked. Here we show that in cold $^{133}$Cs atoms there is\na large number of these resonances that display a significant transfer\nefficiency due to their strong interactions, even at low electric field. We\nalso develop a graphical method enabling to find all possible resonances\nsimultaneously. The resulting dramatic increase in the total number of\naddressable resonant energy transfers at different electric fields could have\nimplications in the search for few-body interactions or macro-molecules built\nfrom Rydberg atoms.",

FDM is a well established method designed for solving the harmonic\ninversion problem or, similarly, for the problem of spectral estimation, and as\nsuch should be applied only to problems of this kind. The authors incorrectly\nassume that the problem of data fitting is equivalent to the spectral\nestimation problem, regardless of what parametric form is used, and,\nconsequently, in all five numerical examples FDM is applied to the wrong\nproblem. Moreover, the authors' implementation of FDM turned out to be\nincorrect, leading to extremely bad results, caused by numerical instabilities.\nAs we demonstrate here, if implemented correctly, FDM could still be used for\nfitting the data, at least for the time signals composed of damped sinusoids,\nresulting in superior performance.

    "abstract": "Exploiting intrinsic structures in sparse signals underpins the recent\nprogress in compressive sensing (CS). The key for exploiting such structures is\nto achieve two desirable properties: generality (\\ie, the ability to fit a wide\nrange of signals with diverse structures) and adaptability (\\ie, being adaptive\nto a specific signal). Most existing approaches, however, often only achieve\none of these two properties. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive Markov\nrandom field sparsity prior for CS, which not only is able to capture a broad\nrange of sparsity structures, but also can adapt to each sparse signal through\nrefining the parameters of the sparsity prior with respect to the compressed\nmeasurements. To maximize the adaptability, we also propose a new sparse signal\nestimation where the sparse signals, support, noise and signal parameter\nestimation are unified into a variational optimization problem, which can be\neffectively solved with an alternative minimization scheme. Extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method in recovery accuracy, noise tolerance, and runtime.",

    "abstract": "Chern-Simons (CS) $\\theta$-systems are described by a $\\theta \\int F\\wedge F$\nterm in the action ($\\theta$ is an adimensional parameter), which does not\nchange field equations in the bulk, but affects the system behaviour when it is\nbounded. When two of those $\\theta$-systems, each one characterized by a\ndifferent value of $\\theta$ (even zero), share a common boundary, surface\neffects are then induced by a CS $\\theta$ term. Here, we study the consequences\nof the above in the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in\n$\\theta$-systems. In a previous paper, electromagnetic radiation properties\ntraversing a $\\theta$-vacuum were analyzed where a number of interesting\nfeatures arise related to polarization and energy distribution. Now, we\ninvestigate how electric and magnetic properties of the $\\theta$-system affect\nthe optical response. Apart from the well-known Kerr polarization rotation\nfound for the particular case of topological insulators, we examine in detail\nthe issue and the results could be applied in other contexts where\n$\\theta$-term accounts for the system dynamics. In particular, we find two\ndifferent Brewster angles, for $s$ and $p$ polarization of reflected radiation,\nrespectively, with peculiar features derived from the $\\theta$ term influence.\nPossible applications of these results are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Cloud-assisted image services are widely used for various applications. Due\nto the high computational complexity of existing image encryption technology,\nit is extremely challenging to provide privacy preserving image services for\nresource-constrained smart device. In this paper, we propose a novel\nencrypressive cloud-assisted image service scheme, called eCIS. The key idea of\neCIS is to shift the high computational cost to the cloud allowing reduction in\ncomplexity of encoder and decoder on resource-constrained device. This is done\nvia compressive sensing (CS) techniques, compared with existing approaches, we\nare able to achieve privacy protection at no additional transmission cost. In\nparticular, we design an encryption matrix by taking care of image compression\nand encryption simultaneously. Such that, the goal of our design is to minimize\nthe mutual information of original image and encrypted image. In addition to\nthe theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security properties and\ncomplexity of our system, we also conduct extensive experiment to evaluate its\nperformance. The experiment results show that eCIS can effectively protect\nimage privacy and meet the user's adaptive secure demand. eCIS reduced the\nsystem overheads by up to $4.1\\times\\sim6.8\\times$ compared with the existing\nCS based image processing approach.",

    "abstract": "We address the issue of applying quantized compressed sensing (CS) on\nlow-energy telemonitoring.

We propose a\ntwo-stage data compressor based on quantized CS, where signals are compressed\nby compressed sensing and then the compressed measurements are quantized with\nonly 2 bits per measurement. This compressor can greatly reduce the\ntransmission bit-budget. To recover signals from underdetermined, quantized\nmeasurements, we develop a Bayesian De-quantization algorithm. It can exploit\nboth the model of quantization errors and the correlated structure of\nphysiological signals to improve the quality of recovery. The proposed data\ncompressor and the recovery algorithm are validated on a dataset recorded on 12\nsubjects during fast running. Experiment results showed that an averaged 2.596\nbeat per minute (BPM) estimation error was achieved by jointly using compressed\nsensing with 50% compression ratio and a 2-bit quantizer.

    "abstract": "The millimeter-wave (mmWave) full-dimensional (FD) MIMO system employs planar\narrays at both the base station and user equipment and can simultaneously\nsupport both azimuth and elevation beamforming. In this paper, we propose\natomic-norm-based methods for mmWave FD-MIMO channel estimation under both\nuniform planar arrays (UPA) and non-uniform planar arrays (NUPA). Unlike\nexisting algorithms such as compressive sensing (CS) or subspace methods, the\natomic-norm-based algorithms do not require to discretize the angle spaces of\nthe angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) into grids, thus\nprovide much better accuracy in estimation. In the UPA case, to reduce the\ncomputational complexity, the original large-scale 4D atomic norm minimization\nproblem is approximately reformulated as a semi-definite program (SDP)\ncontaining two decoupled two-level Toeplitz matrices. The SDP is then solved\nvia the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) where each iteration\ninvolves only closed-form computations. In the NUPA case, the atomic-norm-based\nformulation for channel estimation becomes nonconvex and a\ngradient-decent-based algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed algorithms achieve better performance than the\nCS-based and subspace-based algorithms.",

Structures and kinematics of the outflow\ncavity wall are investigated in the CS line, and are analyzed by using a\nparabolic model of an outflow. We constrain the inclination angle of the\noutflow to be from 75 degree to 90 degree, i.e. the outflow is blowing almost\nperpendicular to the line of sight. Comparing the outflow parameters derived\nfrom the model analysis with those of other sources, we confirm that the\nopening angle of the outflow and the gas velocity on its cavity wall correlate\nwith the dynamical timescale of the outflows. Moreover, a hint of a rotating\nmotion of the outflow cavity wall is found. Although the rotation motion is\nmarginal, the specific angular momentum of the gas on the outflow cavity wall\nis evaluated to be comparable to or twice that of the infalling-rotating\nenvelope of L483.",

    "abstract": "Language identification for code-switching (CS), the phenomenon of\nalternating between two or more languages in conversations, has traditionally\nbeen approached under the assumption of a single language per token. However,\nif at least one language is morphologically rich, a large number of words can\nbe composed of morphemes from more than one language (intra-word CS). In this\npaper, we extend the language identification task to the subword-level, such\nthat it includes splitting mixed words while tagging each part with a language\nID. We further propose a model for this task, which is based on a segmental\nrecurrent neural network. In experiments on a new Spanish--Wixarika dataset and\non an adapted German--Turkish dataset, our proposed model performs slightly\nbetter than or roughly on par with our best baseline, respectively. Considering\nonly mixed words, however, it strongly outperforms all baselines.",

    "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a new paradigm for the efficient acquisition of\nsignals that have sparse representation in a certain domain. Traditionally, CS\nhas provided numerous methods for signal recovery over an orthonormal basis.\nHowever, modern applications have sparked the emergence of related methods for\nsignals not sparse in an orthonormal basis but in some arbitrary, perhaps\nhighly overcomplete, dictionary, particularly due to their potential to\ngenerate different kinds of sparse representation of signals. To this end, we\napply a signal space greedy method, which relies on the ability to optimally\nproject a signal onto a small number of dictionary atoms, to address signal\nrecovery in this setting. We describe a generalized variant of the iterative\nrecovery algorithm called Signal space Subspace Pursuit (SSSP) for this more\nchallenging setting. Here, using the Dictionary-Restricted Isometry Property\n(D-RIP) rather than classical RIP, we derive a low bound on the number of\nmeasurements required and then provide the proof of convergence for the\nalgorithm. The algorithm in noisy and noise-free measurements has low\ncomputational complexity and provides high recovery accuracy.

    "abstract": "In millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, beamforming with large\nantenna arrays is critical to overcome high path losses. Separating all-digital\nbeamforming into analog and digital stages can provide the large reduction in\npower consumption and small loss in spectral efficiency needed for practical\nimplementations. Developing algorithms with this favorable tradeoff is\nchallenging due to the additional degrees of freedom in the analog stage and\nits accompanying hardware constraints. In hybrid beamforming systems, for\nexample, channel estimation algorithms do not directly observe the channels,\nface a high channel count, and operate at low SNR before transmit-receive beam\nalignment. Since mmWave channels are sparse in time and beam domains, many\ncompressed sensing (CS) channel estimation algorithms have been developed that\nrandomly configure the analog beamformers, digital beamformers, and/or pilot\nsymbols. In this paper, we propose to design deterministic beamformers and\npilot symbols for open-loop channel estimation.

    "abstract": "We report a detailed electronic structure calculation for Vanadium (V) using\nDFT, DFT+$U$, $G_0W_0$, $GW_0$ and DFT+DMFT methods. The calculated values of\n$W$, $U$ and $J$ by cRPA method are $\\sim$1.1, $\\sim$3.4 and $\\sim$0.52 eV,\nrespectively. The comparison between calculated spectra (CS) and experimental\nspectra (ES) suggests that $W$ ($U$) is more accurate for DFT+$U$ (DFT+DMFT)\nmethod. The CS, obtained by these methods, give fairly good agreement with ES\nfor peaks' positions except $GW_0$. The shallowness of the dips lying $\\sim$\n-1.5 eV and $\\sim$1.0 eV in ES are properly explained by DFT+DMFT method only,\ndue to the presence of incoherent $t_{2g}$ states.

    "title": "Compressed Sensing Microscopy with Scanning Line Probes",
    "abstract": "In applications of scanning probe microscopy, images are acquired by raster\nscanning a point probe across a sample. Viewed from the perspective of\ncompressed sensing (CS), this pointwise sampling scheme is inefficient,\nespecially when the target image is structured. While replacing point\nmeasurements with delocalized, incoherent measurements has the potential to\nyield order-of-magnitude improvements in scan time, implementing the\ndelocalized measurements of CS theory is challenging. In this paper we study a\npartially delocalized probe construction, in which the point probe is replaced\nwith a continuous line, creating a sensor which essentially acquires line\nintegrals of the target image. We show through simulations, rudimentary\ntheoretical analysis, and experiments, that these line measurements can image\nsparse samples far more efficiently than traditional point measurements,\nprovided the local features in the sample are enough separated. Despite this\npromise, practical reconstruction from line measurements poses additional\ndifficulties: the measurements are partially coherent, and real measurements\nexhibit nonidealities. We show how to overcome these limitations using natural\nstrategies (reweighting to cope with coherence, blind calibration for\nnonidealities), culminating in an end-to-end demonstration.",

    "abstract": "An optical tweezer composed of a strongly focused single-spatial-mode\nGaussian beam of a red-detuned 1064-nm laser can confine a single-cesium (Cs)\natom at the strongest point of the light intensity. We can use this for\ncoherent manipulation of single-quantum bits and single-photon sources. The\ntrapping lifetime of the atoms in the optical tweezers is very short due to the\nimpact of the background atoms, the laser intensity fluctuation of optical\ntweezer and the residual thermal motion of the atoms. In this paper, we\nanalyzed the influence of the background pressure, the trap frequency of\noptical tweezers and the parametric heating of the optical tweezer on the\natomic trapping lifetime. Combined with the external feedback loop based on an\nacousto-optical modulator (AOM), the intensity fluctuation of the 1064-nm laser\nin the time domain was suppressed from $\\pm$ 3.360$\\%$ to $\\pm$ 0.064$\\%$, and\nthe suppression bandwidth reached approximately 33 kHz.

    "abstract": "Black phosphorous (BP) is a layered semiconductor with high carrier mobility,\nanisotropic optical response and wide bandgap tunability. In view of its\napplication in optoelectronic devices, understanding transient photo-induced\neffects is crucial. Here, we investigate by time- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy BP in its pristine state and in the presence of\nStark splitting, chemically induced by Cs ad-sorption. We show that\nphoto-injected carriers trigger bandgap renormalization and a concurrent\nvalence band attening caused by Pauli blocking. In the biased sample,\nphotoexcitation leads to a long-lived (ns) surface photovoltage of few hundreds\nmV that counterbalances the Cs-induced surface band bending. This allows us to\ndisentangle bulk from surface electronic states and to clarify the mechanism\nunderlying the band inversion observed in bulk samples.",

We experimentally show that systematic errors induced by\nmagnetic field gradients and laser fields are highly suppressed in the\ncomagnetometer, but those induced by asynchronous optical pumping and drift of\nresidual magnetic field in the shield dominate the uncertainty of the\ncomagnetometer. With this comagnetometer system, we set the constraint on the\nstrength of spin-gravity coupling of the proton at a level of $10^{-18}$ eV,\ncomparable to the most stringent one. With further optimization in magnetic\nfield stabilization and spin polarization, the systematic errors can be\neffectively suppressed, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved,\npromising to set more stringent constraints on spin-gravity interactions.",

    "abstract": "Applying compressive sensing (CS) allows for sub-Nyquist sampling in several\napplication areas in 5G and beyond. This reduces the associated training,\nfeedback, and computation overheads in many applications. However, the\napplicability of CS relies on the validity of a signal sparsity assumption and\nknowing the exact sparsity level. It is customary to assume a foreknown\nsparsity level. Still, this assumption is not valid in practice, especially\nwhen applying learned dictionaries as sparsifying transforms. The problem is\nmore strongly pronounced with multidimensional sparsity. In this paper, we\npropose an algorithm for estimating the composite sparsity lying in multiple\ndomains defined by learned dictionaries. The proposed algorithm estimates the\nsparsity level over a dictionary by inferring it from its counterpart with\nrespect to a compact discrete Fourier basis. This inference is achieved by a\nmachine learning prediction. This setting learns the intrinsic relationship\nbetween the columns of a dictionary and those of such a fixed basis. The\nproposed algorithm is applied to estimating sparsity levels in wireless\nchannels, and in cognitive radio spectra. Extensive simulations validate a high\nquality of sparsity estimation leading to performances very close to the\nimpractical case of assuming known sparsity.",

Thus, in this paper, we propose a single-stage\ndesign, which supports end-to-end training and low-latency inference. To aid in\nthis goal, we create a synthetic dataset for CS to overcome the lack of\ntraining data and explore different training strategies using this dataset.\nExperiments demonstrate that our model yields competitive retrieval\neffectiveness against state-of-the-art multi-stage approaches but with lower\nlatency. Furthermore, we show that improved retrieval effectiveness benefits\nthe downstream task of conversational question answering.",

    "abstract": "Pressure evolution of the superconducting kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is\nstudied with single-crystal x-ray diffraction and density-functional\nband-structure calculations. A highly anisotropic compression observed up to 5\nGPa is ascribed to the fast shrinkage of the Cs-Sb distances and suppression of\nCs rattling motion. This prevents Sb displacements required to stabilize the\nthree-dimensional charge-density-wave (CDW) state and elucidates the\ndisappearance of the CDW already at 2 GPa despite only minor changes in the\nelectronic structure. At higher pressures, vanadium bands still change only\nmarginally, whereas antimony bands undergo a major reconstruction caused by the\ngradual formation of the interlayer Sb-Sb bonds. Our results highlight the\ncentral role of Sb atoms in the stabilization of a three-dimensional CDW and\nre-entrant superconductivity of a kagome metal.",

    "abstract": "CS is among the most abundant gas-phase S-bearing molecules in cold dark\nmolecular clouds. It is easily observable with several transitions in the\nmillimeter wavelength range, and has been widely used as a tracer of the gas\ndensity in the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and external galaxies.\nChemical models fail to account for the observed CS abundances when assuming\nthe cosmic value for the elemental abundance of sulfur. The CS+O -> CO + S\nreaction has been proposed as a relevant CS destruction mechanism at low\ntemperatures, and could explain the discrepancy between models and\nobservations. Its reaction rate has been experimentally measured at\ntemperatures of 150-400 K, but the extrapolation to lower temperatures is\ndoubtful. Here we calculate the CS+O reaction rate at temperatures <150 K which\nare prevailing in the interstellar medium. We performed ab initio calculations\nto obtain the three lowest PES of the CS+O system. These PESs are used to study\nthe reaction dynamics, using several methods to eventually calculate the CS+O\nthermal reaction rates. We compare the results of our theoretical calculations\nfor 150-400 K with those obtained in the laboratory. Our detailed theoretical\nstudy on the CS+O reaction, which is in agreement with the experimental data\nobtained at 150-400 K, demonstrates the reliability of our approach. After a\ncareful analysis at lower temperatures, we find that the rate constant at 10 K\nis negligible, which is consistent with the extrapolation of experimental data\nusing the Arrhenius expression. We use the updated chemical network to model\nthe sulfur chemistry in TMC1 based on molecular abundances determined from GEMS\nproject observations. In our model, we take into account the expected decrease\nof the cosmic ray ionization rate along the cloud.

A comparison\nof intensity ratios among the transient absorptions suggests a solar-like\ncomposition of the CS gas.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first substantial study of the chemistry of the\nenvelopes around a sample of 18 low-mass pre- and protostellar objects for\nwhich physical properties have previously been derived from radiative transfer\nmodeling of their dust continuum emission. Single-dish line observations of 24\ntransitions of 9 molecular species (not counting isotopes) including HCO+,\nN2H+, CS, SO, SO2, HCN, HNC, HC3N and CN are reported. The line intensities are\nused to constrain the molecular abundances by comparison to Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer modeling of the line strengths. An empirical chemical\nnetwork is constructed on the basis of correlations between the abundances of\nvarious species. For example, it is seen that the HCO+ and CO abundances are\nlinearly correlated, both increasing with decreasing envelope mass. Species\nsuch as CS, SO and HCN show no trend with envelope mass. In particular no trend\nis seen between ``evolutionary stage'' of the objects and the abundances of the\nmain sulfur- or nitrogen-containing species. Among the nitrogen-bearing species\nabundances of CN, HNC and HC3N are found to be closely correlated, which can be\nunderstood from considerations of the chemical network. The CS/SO abundance\nratio is found to correlate with the abundances of CN and HC3N, which may\nreflect a dependence on the atomic carbon abundance. An anti-correlation is\nfound between the deuteration of HCO+ and HCN, reflecting different temperature\ndependences for gas-phase deuteration mechanisms. The abundances are compared\nto other protostellar environments. In particular it is found that the\nabundances in the cold outer envelope of the previously studied class 0\nprotostar IRAS16293-2422 are in good agreement with the average abundances for\nthe presented sample of class 0 objects.",

Our analysis\nis based on high angular resolution observations in at least two transitions of\nNH3, N2H+, CS, C34S, C18O, and C17O, together with maps of the 1.2 mm\ncontinuum. For both cores, we derive radial profiles of constant temperature\nand constant turbulence, together with density distributions close to those of\nnon-singular isothermal spheres. Using these physical conditions and a Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer model, we derive abundance profiles for all species\nand model the strong chemical differentiation of the core interiors. According\nto our models, the NH3 abundance increases toward the core centers by a factor\nof several while N2H+ has a constant abundance over most of the cores. In\ncontrast, both C18O and CS (and isotopomers) are strongly depleted in the core\ninteriors, most likely due to their freeze out onto grains at densities of a\nfew 10^4 cm^{-3}. Concerning the kinematics of the dense gas, we find (in\naddition to constant turbulence) a pattern of internal motions at the level of\n0.1 km s^{-1}. These motions seem correlated with asymmetries in the pattern of\nmolecular depletion, and we interpret them as residuals of core contraction.\nTheir distribution and size suggest that core formation occurs in a rather\nirregular manner and with a time scale of a Myr. A comparison of our derived\ncore properties with those predicted by supersonic turbulence models of core\nformation shows that our Taurus cores are much more quiescent than\nrepresentative predictions from these models.",

Old photographic plates are used to establish that\nthe period before 1940 was around 490 days.

Among the sources detected in\nCS, ca. 76% have also been detected in C17O and ca. 93% in the 1.2 mm cont.\nMm-cont. maps show the presence of clumps with diameters 0.2-2 pc and masses\nfrom a few Msun to 10^5 Msun; H2 volume densities lie between ca. 10^{4.5} and\n10^{5.5} cm^{-3}. The L(bol) are 10^3-10^6 Lsun, consistent with embedded\nhigh-mass objects. Based on our results and those found in the literature for\nother samples, we conclude that our sources are massive objects probably in a\nstage prior to the formation of an HII region. We propose a scenario in which\n'High' and 'Low' sources are both made of a massive clump hosting a high-mass\nprotostellar candidate and a nearby stellar cluster. The difference might be\ndue to the fact that the IRAS 12mu flux, the best discriminant between the two\ngroups, is dominated by the emission from the cluster in 'Lows' and from the\nmassive protostellar object in 'Highs'.",

    "abstract": "We present FCRAO maps as well as combined BIMA and FCRAO maps of the high\ndensity molecular emission towards the CS core in the L673 region. With the\nFCRAO telescope, we mapped the emission in the CS(2-1), C34S(2-1), HCO+(1-0),\nand H13CO+(1-0) lines. The high density molecular emission, which arises from a\nfilamentary structure oriented in the NW-SE direction, shows clear\nmorphological differences for each molecule. We find that HCO+ has an extremely\nhigh optical depth, and that the H13CO+ emission is well correlated with submm\nsources. The BIMA and FCRAO combined maps recover emission from a lot of other\nstructure which was previously undetected or only marginally detected, and show\nan overall aspect of a filamentary structure connecting several intense clumps.\nWe found a total 15 clumps in our combined data cube, all of them resolved by\nour angular resolution, with diameters in the 0.03-0.09 pc range. We find a\nclear segregation between the northern and southern region of the map: the\nnorthern section shows the less chemically evolved gas and less massive but\nmore numerous clumps, while the southern region is dominated by the largest and\nmost massive clump, and contains the more evolved gas, as traced by emission of\nlate-time molecules. We find that the derived clump masses are below the virial\nmass, and that the clumps masses become closer to the virial mass when they get\nbigger and more massive. This supports the idea that these clumps must be\ntransient, and only the more massive ones have a chance to last long enough to\nform stars. The clumps we detect are probably in an earlier evolutionary stage\nthan the ``starless cores'' reported recently in the literature. Only the most\nmassive one has properties similar to a ``starless core''.",

The dense gas and dust in the system is\naligned into a long ridge morphology extending ~0.4 pc with 16 gas clumps of\nestimated masses ranging from 0.14 - 1.8 Solar masses. A north-south variation\nin the CS center line velocity can be explained with a two cloud model. We\nposit that the BD +40 4124 stellar cluster formed from a cloud-cloud collision.\nThe largest linewidths occur near V1318 Cyg-S, a massive star affecting its\nnatal environment. In contrast, the dense gas near the other, more evolved,\nmassive stars displays no evidence for disruption; the material must either be\nprocessed into the star, dissipate, or relax, fairly quickly. The more evolved\nlow-mass protostars are more likely to be found near the massive stars. If the\nmajority of low-mass stars are coeval, the seemingly evolved low-mass\nprotostars are not older: the massive stars have eroded their structures.\nFinally, at the highest resolution, the 3.1 mm dust emission is resolved into a\nflattened structure 3100 by 1500 AU with an estimated mass of 3.4 Solar masses.\nThe continuum and CS emission are offset by 1.1 arcsec from the southern binary\nsource. A simple estimate of the extinction due to the continuum emission\nstructure is AV = 700 mag. From the offset and as the southern source is\ndetected in the optical, the continuum emission is from a previously unknown\nvery young, intermediate-mass, embedded stellar object.

CS\n30322-023 is also remarkable in having the lowest surface gravity (log g <=\n-0.3) among the metal-poor stars studied to date. The available evidence\nindicates that this star is presently a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant\nbranch (TP-AGB) star, with no strong indication of binarity thus far (although\na signal of period 192 d is clearly present in the radial-velocity data, this\nis likely due to pulsation of the stellar envelope). We show that low-mass\nTP-AGB stars are not expected to be exceedingly rare in a magnitude-limited\nsample such as the HK survey, because their high luminosities make it possible\nto sample them over a very large volume. The strong N overabundance and the low\n12C/13C ratio (4) in this star is typical of the operation of the CN cycle.\nCoupled with a Na overabundance and the absence of a strong C overabundance,\nthis pattern seems to imply that hot-bottom burning operated in this star,\nwhich should then have a mass of at least 2 Msun. However, the luminosity\nassociated with this mass would put the star at a distance of about 50 kpc, in\nthe outskirts of the galactic halo. We explore alternative scenarios in which\nthe observed abundance pattern results from some mixing mechanism yet to be\nidentified occurring in a single low-metallicity 0.8 Msun AGB star, or from\npollution by matter from an intermediate-mass AGB companion which has undergone\nhot-bottom burning. We stress, however, that our abundances may be subject to\nuncertainties due to NLTE or 3D granulation effects which were not taken into\nconsideration.",

The PFS takes place at low temperatures, $T \\leq T_{\\rm PFS}$, where\neach electron or CS fermion splinters off into two quasiparticles, a fermionic\nchargeon and a bosonic fluxon.

At sufficiently low temperatures $T\n\\leq T_{\\rm BC} (< T_{\\rm PFS})$, fluxons Bose-condense uniformly and (partly)\ncancel the external magnetic field, producing the correlation holes. This\npartial cancellation validates the mean-field theory in Jain's CF approach.\nFQHE takes place at $T < T_{\\rm BC}$ as a joint effect of (i) integer QHE of\nchargeons under the residual field $\\Delta B$ and (ii) Bose condensation of\nfluxons.

We analyzed the\nFUSE (Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer) spectra of a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars (HAeBes) covering a broad spectral range, including the\nmain-sequence A5 star Beta-Pictoris. To better diagnose the origin of the\ndetected H2 and its excitation conditions, we used a model of a\nphotodissociation region. Our analysis demonstrates that the excitation of H2\nis clearly different around most of the HAeBes compared to the interstellar\nmedium. Moreover, the characteristics of H2 around Herbig Ae and Be stars give\nevidence for different excitation mechanisms. For the most massive stars of our\nsample (B8 to B2 type), the excitation diagrams are reproduced well by a model\nof photodissociation regions (PDR). Our results favor an interpretation in\nterms of large CS envelopes, remnants of the molecular clouds in which the\nstars were formed. On the other hand, the group of Ae stars (later than B9\ntype) known to possess disks is more inhomogeneous. In most cases, when CS H2\nis detected, the lines of sight do not pass through the disks. The excitation\nconditions of H2 around Ae stars cannot be reproduced by PDR models and\ncorrespond to warm and/or hot excited media very close to the stars. In\naddition, no clear correlation has been found between the ages of the stars and\nthe amount of circumstellar H2. Our results suggest structural differences\nbetween Herbig Ae and Be star environments. Herbig Be stars do evolve faster\nthan Ae stars, and consequently, most Herbig Be stars are younger than Ae ones\nat the time we observe them. It is thus more likely to find remnants of their\nparent cloud around them.",

The mixed\nchemistry is derived from the simultaneous detection of PAH features in the\n6-14 micron range and crystalline silicates (CS) beyond 20 microns in the\nSpitzer/IRS spectra. Out of the 26 PNe observed in the GB, 21 show signatures\nof DDC. Our observations reveal that the simultaneous presence of O- and C-rich\ndust features in the IR spectra of [WC]-type PNe is not restricted to late/cool\n[WC]-type stars, as previously suggested in the literature, but is a common\nfeature associated with all [WC]-type PNe. Surprisingly, we found that the DDC\nis seen also in all observed wels, as well as in other PNe with central stars\nbeing neither [WC] nor wels. Most sources observed display CS features in their\nspectra, with only a few PNe exhibiting, in addition, amorphous silicate bands.\nWe appear to detect a recent change of chemistry at the end of the AGB\nevolution in the low-mass, high-metallicity population of GB PNe observed. The\ndeficit of C-rich AGB stars in this environment suggests that the process of\nPAH formation in PNe occurs at the very end of the AGB phase. In addition, the\npopulation of low-mass, O-rich AGB stars in the GB, do not exhibit CS features\nin their spectra. Thus, the high detection rate of DDC that we find cannot be\nexplained by long-lived O-rich (primordial or circumbinary) disks. Our most\nplausible scenario is a final thermal pulse on the AGB (or just after), which\ncould produce enhanced mass loss, capable of removing/mixing (sometimes\ncompletely) the remaining H-rich envelope and exposing the internal C-rich\nlayers, and generating shocks responsible for the silicate crystallization.",

(arXive:astro-ph:/1011.4035, 2010) the authors\naddressed some open questions of the CSHKP scenario of solar flares by means of\nhigh-resolution MHD simulations. They focused, in particular, on the problem of\nenergy transfer from large to small scales in decaying flare current sheet\n(CS). Their calculations suggest, that magnetic flux-ropes (plasmoids) are\nformed in full range of scales by a cascade of tearing and coalescence\nprocesses. Consequently, the initially thick current layer becomes highly\nfragmented. Thus, the tearing and coalescence cascade can cause an effective\nenergy transfer across the scales. In the current paper we investigate whether\nthis mechanism actually applies in solar flares. We extend the MHD simulation\nby deriving model-specific features that can be looked for in observations. The\nresults of the underlying MHD model showed that the plasmoid cascade creates a\nspecific hierarchical distribution of non-ideal/acceleration regions embedded\nin the CS. We therefore focus on the features associated with the fluxes of\nenergetic particles, in particular on the structure and dynamics of emission\nregions in flare ribbons. We assume that the structure and dynamics of\ndiffusion regions embedded in the CS imprint themselves into structure and\ndynamics of flare-ribbon kernels by means of magnetic-field mapping. Using the\nresults of the underlying MHD simulation we derive the expected structure of\nribbon emission and we extract selected statistical properties of the modelled\nbright kernels.

    "abstract": "Based on a compilation of OVI, CIV, SiIV and NV data from IUE, FUSE, GHRS,\nSTIS, and COS, we derive an anti- correlation between the stellar temperature\nand the high ion velocity shift w.r.t. to the photosphere, with positive (resp.\nnegative) velocity shifts for the cooler (resp. hotter) white dwarfs. This\ntrend probably reflects more than a single process, however such a dependence\non the WD's temperature again favors a CS origin for a very large fraction of\nthose ion absorptions, previously observed with IUE, HST-STIS, HST-GHRS, FUSE,\nand now COS, selecting objects for which absorption line radial velocities,\nstellar effective temperature and photospheric velocity can be found in the\nliterature. Interestingly, and gas in near-equilibrium in the star vicinity. It\nis also probably significant that the temperature that corresponds to a null\nradial velocity, i.e. \\simeq 50,000K, also corresponds to the threshold below\nwhich there is a dichotomy between pure or heavy elements atmospheres as well\nas some temperature estimates for and a form of balance between radiation\npressure and gravitation. This is consistent with ubiquitous evaporation of\norbiting dusty material. Together with the fact that the fraction of stars with\n(red-or blue-) shifted lines and the fraction of stars known to possess heavy\nspecies in their atmosphere are of the same order, such a velocity-temperature\nrelationship is consistent with quasi-continuous evaporation of orbiting CS\ndusty material, followed by accretion and settling down in the photosphere. In\nview of these results, ion measurements close to the photospheric or the IS\nvelocity should be interpreted with caution, especially for stars at\nintermediate temperatures. While tracing CS gas, they may be erroneously\nattributed to photospheric material or to the ISM, explaining the difficulty of\nfinding a coherent pattern of the high ions in the local IS 3D distribution.",

A large number of rotational transitions covering a wide range\nof energy levels, including highly excited vibrational states, are detected in\nemission and serve to trace different regions of the envelope.

The excitation\ncalculations include infrared pumping to excited vibrational states and\ninelastic collisions, for which up-to-date rate coefficients for rotational\nand, in some cases, ro-vibrational transitions are used. We find that in the\ninner layers CS, SiO, and SiS have abundances relative to H$_2$ of 4e-6,\n1.8e-7, and 3e-6, respectively, and that CS and SiS have significant lower\nabundances in the outer envelope, which implies that they actively contribute\nto the formation of dust. Moreover, in the inner layers, the amount of sulfur\nand silicon in gas phase molecules is only 27 % for S and 5.6 % for Si,\nimplying that these elements have already condensed onto grains, most likely in\nthe form of MgS and SiC. Metal-bearing molecules lock up a relatively small\nfraction of metals, although our results indicate that NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF,\nand NaCN, despite their refractory character, are not significantly depleted in\nthe cold outer layers.

    "abstract": "(shortened) We investigate the properties of Galactic WR stars and their\nenvironment to identify evolutionary channels that may lead to the formation of\nLGRBs. To this purpose we compile available information on the\nspectropolarimetric properties, the presence of CS ejecta, and the CS\nvelocities in the environment of Galactic WR stars. We use linear\nline-depolarization as an indicator of rotation, nebular morphology as an\nindicator of stellar ejecta, and velocity patterns in UV absorption features as\nan indicator of increased velocities in the CS environment. We find that the\n~23% WR stars with \"possible ejecta nebulae\" dominate the population of WR\nstars with spectropolarimetric signatures of rotation, while WR stars without\nsuch nebulae only rarely show indications of rotation. The corresponding\nobjects are most likely in an early stage after a preceding RSG or LBV phase,\nand have not yet lost their angular momenta due to the strong mass-loss in the\nWR phase. From their photometric periods we estimate rotation parameters in the\nrange omega = 0.04...0.25, corresponding to moderate rotation speeds of\n36...120 km/s. These values are very uncertain, but comply with the specific\nsurface angular momentum requirement for LGRB progenitors. Our results indicate\nthat, in the Galaxy, mainly \"young\" WR stars shortly after a RSG/LBV phase show\nspectropolarimetric signatures of rotation. Their rotation rates are thus\nlikely enhanced with respect to the majority of Galactic WR stars. According to\ntheir estimated specific surface angular momenta, a subgroup of stars exploding\nin this phase may represent an evolutionary channel towards LGRBs at high\nmetallicities, comparable to the Galaxy.",

The HM is conceptualized as an ecological organism that `colonizes' the\nresource zone of the plant cells driven by the potential supplied by the higher\nHM concentration in the substrate. The infinite occupation by the HM is limited\nby the eventual saturation of the cellular binding sites. The solution of the\ndifferential equation results in the logistic equation, the r-K model. The\nmodel is tested for 3 metalophillic plants T.erecta, S. vulgaris and E.\nsplendens growing in different types of substrates, contaminated to varying\nextents by different copper compounds. The model fitted the experimental Cp- Cs\nprofiles well. The r, K parameter values and secondary quantities derived from\nthem, allowed a quantification of the number of Cu binding sites per cell at\nsaturation, the sensitivities (affinities) of these sites for Cu in the 3\nexperimental systems as well as the extraction of information related to the\nsubstrate phyto-availability of the Cu. Thus even though the model operates at\nthe systems level it permits useful insights into underlying processes that\nultimately derive from the cumulative molecular processes of HM homeostasis.\nThe chief advantages of the model are its simplicity, fewer arbitrary\nparameters, and the non-specification of constraints on substrate and plant\ntype.",

    "abstract": "Reducing acquisition time is a crucial challenge for many imaging techniques.\nCompressed Sensing (CS) theory offers an appealing framework to address this\nissue since it provides theoretical guarantees on the reconstruction of sparse\nsignals by projection on a low dimensional linear subspace. In this paper, we\nfocus on a setting where the imaging device allows to sense a fixed set of\nmeasurements. We first discuss the choice of an optimal sampling subspace\n(smallest subset) allowing perfect reconstruction of sparse signals. Its\nstandard design relies on the random drawing of independent measurements. We\ndiscuss how to select the drawing distribution and show that a mixed strategy\ninvolving partial deterministic sampling and independent drawings can help\nbreaking the so-called \"coherence barrier\". Unfortunately, independent random\nsampling is irrelevant for many acquisition devices owing to acquisition\nconstraints. To overcome this limitation, the notion of Variable Density\nSamplers (VDS) is introduced and defined as a stochastic process with a\nprescribed limit empirical measure. It encompasses samplers based on\nindependent measurements or continuous curves. The latter are crucial to extend\nCS results to actual applications. Our main contribution lies in two original\ncontinuous VDS. The first one relies on random walks over the acquisition space\nwhereas the second one is heuristically driven and rests on the approximate\nsolution of a Traveling Salesman Problem. Theoretical analysis and\nretrospective CS simulations in magnetic resonance imaging highlight that the\nTSP-based solution provides improved reconstructed images in terms of\nsignal-to-noise ratio compared to standard sampling schemes (spiral, radial, 3D\niid...).",

We focus in particular\non the Kitaev chain with long-range pairings decaying with distance as\npower-law with exponent $\\alpha$. This is a quadratic solvable model, yet\ndisplaying non-trivial quantum phase transitions. By renormalization group\napproach we derive first the effective theory close to the critical line at\npositive chemical potential. This is the sum of two terms: a Dirac action\n$S_D$, found in the short-range Ising universality class, and a CS breaking\nterm $S_{AN}$. While $S_D$ originates from low-energy excitations, $S_{AN}$\nderives from the higher energy modes where singularities develop, due to the\nlong-range nature of the model. At criticality $S_{AN}$ flows to zero if\n$\\alpha > 2$, while if $\\alpha < 2$ it dominates and determines the breakdown\nof the CS. Out of criticality $S_{AN}$ breaks, in the considered approximation,\nthe effective Lorentz invariance (ELI) for every finite $\\alpha$. As $\\alpha$\nincreases, such ELI breakdown becomes less and less pronounced and in the\nshort-range limit $\\alpha \\to \\infty$ the ELI is restored. To test the validity\nof the effective theory, we compared the two-fermion static correlations and\nthe von Neumann entropy obtained from them with the ones calculated on the\nlattice, finding agreement. From the effective theory one can also see that new\nphases emerge for $\\alpha < 1$. Finally we show that at every finite $\\alpha$\nthe critical exponents are the same as for the short-range ($\\alpha \\to\n\\infty$) model. At variance, for the critical line with negative chemical\npotential, only $S_{AN}$ ($S_D$) is present for $1 < \\alpha < 2$ (for $\\alpha >\n2$).

    "abstract": "Interest in computer science is growing. As a result, computer science (CS)\nand related departments are experiencing an explosive increase in undergraduate\nenrollments and unprecedented demand from other disciplines for learning\ncomputing. According to the 2014 CRA Taulbee Survey, the number of\nundergraduates declaring a computing major at Ph.D. granting departments in the\nUS has increased 60% from 2011-2014 and the number of degrees granted has\nincreased by 34% from 2008-2013. However, this growth is not limited to higher\neducation. New York City, San Francisco and Oakland public schools will soon be\noffering computer science to all students at all schools from preschool to 12th\ngrade, although it will be an elective for high school students. This\nunprecedented demand means that CS departments are likely to teach not only\nmore students in the coming decades, but more diverse students, with more\nvaried backgrounds, motivations, preparations, and abilities.\n  This growth is an unparalleled opportunity to expand the reach of computing\neducation. However, this growth is also a unique research challenge, as we know\nvery little about how best to teach our current students, let alone the\nstudents soon to arrive. The burgeoning field of Computing Education Research\n(CER) is positioned to address this challenge by answering research questions\nsuch as, how should we teach computer science, from programming to advanced\nprinciples, to a broader and more diverse audience? We argue that computer\nscience departments should lead the way in establishing CER as a foundational\nresearch area of computer science, discovering the best ways to teach CS, and\ninventing the best technologies with which to teach it. This white paper\nprovides a snapshot of the current state of CER and makes actionable\nrecommendations for academic leaders to grow CER as a successful research area\nin their departments.",

    "abstract": "Subarcsecond-resolution images of the rotational line emissions of CS and\nc-C$_3$H$_2$ obtained toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 04368$+$2557 in L1527\nwith the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array are investigated to\nconstrain the orientation of the outflow/envelope system. The distribution of\nCS consists of an envelope component extending from north to south and a faint\nbutterfly-shaped outflow component. The kinematic structure of the envelope is\nwell reproduced by a simple ballistic model of an infalling rotating envelope.\nAlthough the envelope has a nearly edge-on configuration, the inclination angle\nof the rotation axis from the plane of the sky is found to be 5$^\\circ$, where\nwe find that the western side of the envelope faces the observer. This\nconfiguration is opposite to the direction of the large-scale ($\\sim$ 10$^4$\nAU) outflow suggested previously from the $^{12}$CO ($J$=3$-$2) observation,\nand to the morphology of infrared reflection near the protostar ($\\sim$ 200\nAU). The latter discrepancy could originate from high extinction by the outflow\ncavity of the western side, these discrepancies or may indicate that the\noutflow axis is not parallel to the rotation axis of the envelope.\nPosition-velocity diagrams show the accelerated outflow cavity wall, and its\nkinematic structure in the 2000 AU scale is explained by a standard parabolic\nmodel with the inclination angle derived from the analysis of the envelope. The\ndifferent orientation of the outflow between the small and large scale implies\na possibility of precession of the outflow axis. The shape and the velocity of\nthe outflow in the vicinity of the protostar are compared with those of other\nprotostars.",

    "abstract": "We observed 146 Galactic clumps in HCN (4-3) and CS (7-6) with the Atacama\nSubmillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10-m telescope. A tight linear\nrelationship between star formation rate and gas mass traced by dust continuum\nemission was found for both Galactic clumps and the high redshift (z>1) star\nforming galaxies (SFGs), indicating a constant gas depletion time of ~100 Myr\nfor molecular gas in both Galactic clumps and high z SFGs. However, low z\ngalaxies do not follow this relation and seem to have a longer global gas\ndepletion time. The correlations between total infrared luminosities (L_TIR)\nand molecular line luminosities (L'_mol) of HCN (4-3) and CS (7-6) are tight\nand sublinear extending down to clumps with LTIR~10^{3} L_sun. These\ncorrelations become linear when extended to external galaxies. A bimodal\nbehavior in the LTIR--L'mol correlations was found for clumps with different\ndust temperature, luminosity-to-mass ratio, and sigmaline/sigmavir. Such\nbimodal behavior may be due to evolutionary effects. The slopes of LTIR--L'mol\ncorrelations become more shallow as clumps evolve. We compared our results with\nlower J transition lines in wu et al. (2010). The correlations between clump\nmasses and line luminosities are close to linear for low effective excitation\ndensity tracers but become sublinear for high effective excitation density\ntracers for clumps with LTIR larger than LTIR~10^4.5 Lsun. High effective\nexcitation density tracers cannot linearly trace the total clump masses,\nleading to a sublinear correlations for both Mclump-L'mol and LTIR-L'mol\nrelations.",

    "abstract": "Applications of perceptual image quality assessment (IQA) in image and video\nprocessing, such as image acquisition, image compression, image restoration and\nmultimedia communication, have led to the development of many IQA metrics. In\nthis paper, a reliable full reference IQA model is proposed that utilize\ngradient similarity (GS), chromaticity similarity (CS), and deviation pooling\n(DP). By considering the shortcomings of the commonly used GS to model human\nvisual system (HVS), a new GS is proposed through a fusion technique that is\nmore likely to follow HVS. We propose an efficient and effective formulation to\ncalculate the joint similarity map of two chromatic channels for the purpose of\nmeasuring color changes. In comparison with a commonly used formulation in the\nliterature, the proposed CS map is shown to be more efficient and provide\ncomparable or better quality predictions. Motivated by a recent work that\nutilizes the standard deviation pooling, a general formulation of the DP is\npresented in this paper and used to compute a final score from the proposed GS\nand CS maps. This proposed formulation of DP benefits from the Minkowski\npooling and a proposed power pooling as well. The experimental results on six\ndatasets of natural images, a synthetic dataset, and a digitally retouched\ndataset show that the proposed index provides comparable or better quality\npredictions than the most recent and competing state-of-the-art IQA metrics in\nthe literature, it is reliable and has low complexity.

    "abstract": "Aims: Little information exists on the circumstellar molecular abundance\nstratifications of many molecules. The aim is to study the circumstellar\nchemical abundance pattern of 11 molecules and isotopologs ($^{12}$CO,\n$^{13}$CO, SiS, $^{28}$SiO, $^{29}$SiO, $^{30}$SiO, HCN, CN, CS, SO, SO$_2$) in\nthe oxygen-rich evolved star IK~Tau. Methods: We have performed an in-depth\nanalysis of a large number of molecular emission lines excited in the\ncircumstellar envelope around IK~Tau. The analysis is done based on a non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer analysis, which\ncalculates the temperature and velocity structure in a self-consistent way. The\nchemical abundance pattern is coupled to theoretical outer wind model\npredictions including photodestruction and cosmic ray ionization. Not only the\nintegrated line intensities, but also the line shapes, are used as diagnostic\ntool to study the envelope structure. Results: The deduced wind acceleration is\nmuch slower than predicted from classical theories. SiO and SiS are depleted in\nthe envelope, possibly due to the adsorption onto dust grains. For HCN and CS a\nclear difference with respect to inner wind non-equilibrium predictions is\nfound, either indicating uncertainties in the inner wind theoretical modeling\nor the possibility that HCN and CS (or the radical CN) participate in the dust\nformation. The low signal-to-noise profiles of SO and CN prohibit an accurate\nabundance determination; the modeling of high-excitation SO$_2$ lines is\ncumbersome, possibly related to line misidentifications or problems with the\ncollisional rates. The SiO isotopic ratios ($^{29}$SiO/$^{28}$SiO and\n$^{30}$SiO/$^{28}$SiO) point toward an enhancement in $^{28}$SiO compared to\nresults of classical stellar evolution codes.

A\nsmall fraction of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars exhibit excesses of heavy\nneutron-capture elements produced in the r-process, and CS 31082-001 is among\nthe 4 well-known r-process-enhanced EMP stars. Observations with HST/STIS\nprovide abundances for elements observable only from the UV region. Here we aim\nto supplement the optical data with abundances from near-UV spectroscopy of the\nfirst and second peak of the r-elements, which are crucial to giving insight\ninto the nucleosynthesis of the elements beyond iron. The UVES spectrum\nprovided additional measurements, thereby improving the previous results. The\nspectra were analyzed with the OSMARCS LTE model atmosphere and with a\nconsistent approach based on the spectrum synthesis code Turbospectrum to\nderive abundances of heavy elements in CS 31082-001, using updated oscillator\nstrengths from the recent literature. We computed synthetic spectra for all\nlines of the elements of interest, checking for proper intensities and possible\nblends. We combined the abundances of heavy elements derived in previous works\nwith the derivation of abundances from all reliable new list of lines, for the\nfirst and second peaks of r-elements. We were able to derive new abundances for\n23 n-elements, 6 of them - Ge, Mo, Lu, Ta, W, and Re - were not available in\nprevious works, making this star the most complete r-II object studied, with a\ntotal of 37 detections of n-capture elements.

    "title": "Regularized Spherical Polar Fourier Diffusion MRI with Optimal\n  Dictionary Learning",
    "abstract": "Compressed Sensing (CS) takes advantage of signal sparsity or compressibility\nand allows superb signal reconstruction from relatively few measurements. Based\non CS theory, a suitable dictionary for sparse representation of the signal is\nrequired. In diffusion MRI (dMRI), CS methods were proposed to reconstruct\ndiffusion-weighted signal and the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP), and there\nare two kinds of Dictionary Learning (DL) methods: 1) Discrete Representation\nDL (DR-DL), and 2) Continuous Representation DL (CR-DL). DR-DL is susceptible\nto numerical inaccuracy owing to interpolation and regridding errors in a\ndiscretized q-space. In this paper, we propose a novel CR-DL approach, called\nDictionary Learning - Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (DL-SPFI) for effective\ncompressed-sensing reconstruction of the q-space diffusion-weighted signal and\nthe EAP. In DL-SPFI, an dictionary that sparsifies the signal is learned from\nthe space of continuous Gaussian diffusion signals. The learned dictionary is\nthen adaptively applied to different voxels using a weighted LASSO framework\nfor robust signal reconstruction. The adaptive dictionary is proved to be\noptimal. Compared with the start-of-the-art CR-DL and DR-DL methods proposed by\nMerlet et al. and Bilgic et al., espectively, our work offers the following\nadvantages. First, the learned dictionary is proved to be optimal for Gaussian\ndiffusion signals. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first work to learn a\nvoxel-adaptive dictionary. The importance of the adaptive dictionary in EAP\nreconstruction will be demonstrated theoretically and empirically. Third,\noptimization in DL-SPFI is only performed in a small subspace resided by the\nSPF coefficients, as opposed to the q-space approach utilized by Merlet et al.\nThe experiment results demonstrate the advantages of DL-SPFI over the original\nSPF basis and Bilgic et al.'s method.",

    "title": "Embedding Cryptographic Features in Compressive Sensing",
    "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) has been widely studied and applied in many fields.\nRecently, the way to perform secure compressive sensing (SCS) has become a\ntopic of growing interest. The existing works on SCS usually take the sensing\nmatrix as a key and the resultant security level is not evaluated in depth.\nThey can only be considered as a preliminary exploration on SCS, but a concrete\nand operable encipher model is not given yet. In this paper, we are going to\ninvestigate SCS in a systematic way. The relationship between CS and\nsymmetric-key cipher indicates some possible encryption models. To this end, we\npropose the two-level protection models (TLPM) for SCS which are developed from\nmeasurements taking and something else, respectively. It is believed that these\nmodels will provide a new point of view and stimulate further research in both\nCS and cryptography. Specifically, an efficient and secure encryption scheme\nfor parallel compressive sensing (PCS) is designed by embedding a two-layer\nprotection in PCS using chaos. The first layer is undertaken by random\npermutation on a two-dimensional signal, which is proved to be an acceptable\npermutation with overwhelming probability. The other layer is to sample the\npermuted signal column by column with the same chaotic measurement matrix,\nwhich satisfies the restricted isometry property of PCS with overwhelming\nprobability. Both the random permutation and the measurement matrix are\nconstructed under the control of a chaotic system. Simulation results show that\nunlike the general joint compression and encryption schemes in which encryption\nalways leads to the same or a lower compression ratio, the proposed approach of\nembedding encryption in PCS actually improves the compression performance.\nBesides, the proposed approach possesses high transmission robustness against\nadditive Gaussian white noise and cropping attack.",

One of the\nmost promising ideas is the shock-interaction mechanism, but only simplified\nsemi-analytical models have been applied so far. We simulate light curves for\nseveral Type I SLSN (SLSN-I) models enshrouded by dense, non-hydrogen\ncircumstellar envelopes, using a multi-group radiation hydrodynamics code that\npredicts not only bolometric, but also multicolor light curves. We demonstrate\nthat the bulk of SLSNe-I including those with relatively narrow light curves\nlike SN 2010gx or broad ones like PTF09cnd can be explained by the interaction\nof the SN ejecta with he CS envelope, though the range of parameters for these\nmodels is rather wide.

The second assumes two different\nmolecules are co-spatial thus their relative linewidths allow for a calculation\nof \\Tkin{} and \\vturb{}. Finally we fit a parametric disk model where physical\nproperties of the disk are described by power laws, to compare our `direct'\nmethods with previous values. The two direct methods were limited to the outer\n$r > 40$~au disk due to beam smear. The direct method found \\vturb{} ranging\nfrom $\\approx$~\\vel{130} at 40~au, dropping to $\\approx$~\\vel{50} in the outer\ndisk, qualitatively recovered with the parametric model fitting. This\ncorresponds to roughly $0.2 - 0.4~c_s$. CN was found to exhibit strong non-LTE\neffects outside $r \\approx 140$~au, so \\vturb{} was limited to within this\nradius.

    "abstract": "Recent computational results suggest that directional dark matter detectors\nhave potential to probe for WIMP dark matter particles below the neutrino\nfloor. The DRIFT-IId detector used in this work is a leading directional WIMP\nsearch time projection chamber detector. We report the first measurements of\nthe detection of the directional nuclear recoils in a fully fiducialised\nlow-pressure time projection chamber. In this new operational mode, the\ndistance between each event vertex and the readout plane is determined by the\nmeasurement of minority carriers produced by adding a small amount of oxygen to\nthe nominal CS$_{2}$ + CF$_{4}$ target gas mixture. The CS$_2$ + CF$_4$ + O$_2$\nmixture has been shown to enable background-free operation at current\nsensitivities. Sulfur, fluorine, and carbon recoils were generated using\nneutrons emitted from a $^{252}$Cf source positioned at different locations\naround the detector. Measurement of the relative energy loss along the recoil\ntracks allowed the track vector sense, or the so-called head-tail asymmetry\nparameter, to be deduced. Results show that the previously reported observation\nof head-tail sensitivity in pure CS$_{2}$ is well retained after the addition\nof oxygen to the gas mixture.",

    "abstract": "Nearby type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), such as SN 2017cbv, are useful events to\naddress the question of what the elusive progenitor systems of the explosions\nare. Hosseinzadeh et al. (2017) suggested that the early blue excess of the\nlightcurve of SN 2017cbv could be due to the supernova ejecta interacting with\na non-degenerate companion star. Some SN Ia progenitor models suggest the\nexistence of circumstellar (CS) environments in which strong outflows create\nlow density cavities of different radii. Matter deposited at the edges of the\ncavities, should be at distances at which photoionisation due to early\nultraviolet (UV) radiation of SNe Ia causes detectable changes to the\nobservable Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption lines. To study possible narrow\nabsorption lines from such material, we obtained a time-series of\nhigh-resolution spectra of SN 2017cbv at phases between $-14.8$ and $+83$ days\nwith respect to $B$-band maximum, covering the time at which photoionisation is\npredicted to occur. Both narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K are detected in all\nspectra, with no measurable changes between the epochs. We use photoionisation\nmodels to rule out the presence of Na I and Ca II gas clouds along the\nline-of-sight of SN 2017cbv between $\\sim8\\times10^{16}$--$2\\times10^{19}$~cm\nand $\\sim10^{15}$--$10^{17}$~cm, respectively.

We\nhave classified the observed area into 5 subregions according to the integrated\nintensity of $^{13}$CO, and have evaluated the contribution to the averaged\nspectrum from each subregion. The CCH, HCN, HCO$^+$, and CS lines can be seen\neven in the spectrum of the subregion with the lowest $^{13}$CO integrated\nintensity range ($< 10$ K km s$^{-1}$).

No indication of magnetism was\nobserved down to the temperature of T=ca.50K, and spectral parameters viz.\ncenter shift, CS, and the main component of the electric field gradient, Vzz,\nbehave regularly. In particular, analysis of CS(T) in terms of the Debye model\nyielded the following values of the Debye temperature, T_D: 453(5) K for the\nsite 6h, 544(10) K for the site 2a, 479(4) K for the weighted average over 6h\nand 2a sites, and 363(35) K for the site 4f.

Analysis of a temperature dependence of the\nhyperfine field, B, associated with the 6h and 2a sub spectra yielded the\nmagnetic ordering temperature T_C1=ca.50K for the former and T_C2=ca.31K for\nthe latter.

    "abstract": "We report on the development and phase noise performance of a 9.1926 GHz\nmicrowave frequency synthesizer to be used as the local oscillator for a Cs\nfountain clock. It is based on frequency multiplication and synthesis from an\nultralow phase noise 5 MHz Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO) and 100\nMHz Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator (VCXO).The key component of the\nfrequency multiplication is a non-linear transmission-line (NLTL) used as a\nfrequency comb generator. The phase noise of the synthesizer is improved by\ncarefully optimizing the input power, the input and output impedances of the\nNLTL. The absolute phase noises of the 9.1926 GHz output signal are measured to\nbe -64 dBc/Hz, -83 dBc/Hz, -92 dBc/Hz, -117 dBc/Hz and -119 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz,\n10Hz, 100Hz, 1 kHz and 10 kHz offset frequencies, respectively. The residual\nphase noise of the synthesizer is measured to be -82 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset\nfrequency. The measurement result shows that the absolute phase noise at the\nfrequency range of 1 - 100 Hz is mainly limited by the phase noise of the OCXO.\nThe contribution of the absolute phase noise to the fountain clock short-term\nfrequency stability is calculated to be 7.0x10^(-14). The residual frequency\nstability of the synthesizer is measured to be1.5x10^(-14), which is consistent\nwith the calculated frequency stability due to the residual phase noise of the\nsynthesizer. Meanwhile we designed and realized an interferometric microwave\nswitch in the synthesizer to eliminate the frequency shifts induced by the\nmicrowave leakage. The extinction ratio of the switch is measured to be more\nthan 50 dB. In the scheme, we use only commercially available components to\nbuild the microwave frequency synthesizer with excellent phase noise\nperformance for high-performance Cs fountain clocks.",

We show\nthat KK reduction of the 3D Einstein action plus its boundary term gives the\nJackiw-Teitelboim (JT) model in 2D with the appropriate 1D boundary term. The\nsize of the KK radius gets identified with the value of the dilaton in the\nresulting near-AdS$_2$ geometry.

    "abstract": "[abridged] Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity is a 4D effective theory that\ndescends both from string theory and loop quantum gravity, and that corrects\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action by adding the product of a scalar field and the\nparity-violating, Pontryagin density. In this theory, the gravitational field\nof spinning black holes is described by a modified Kerr geometry whose\nmultipole moments deviate from the Kerr ones only at the fourth multipole, l =\n4. We investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational wave\nemission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive black\nholes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. We use the\nsemi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of the\nmassive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from a\nmultipolar decomposition of the radiative field. The main CS corrections to the\nwaveforms arise from modifications to the geodesic trajectories, due to changes\nto the massive black hole geometry, and manifest themselves as an accumulating\ndephasing relative to the general relativistic case. We also explore the\npropagation and the stress-energy tensor of gravitational waves in this theory.\nWe find that, although this tensor has the same form as in General Relativity,\nthe energy and angular momentum balance laws are indeed modified through the\nstress-energy tensor of the CS scalar field. These balance laws could be used\nto describe the inspiral through adiabatic changes in the orbital parameters,\nwhich in turn would enhance the dephasing effect. Gravitational-wave\nobservations of intermediate- or extreme-mass ratio inspirals with advanced\nground detectors or with LISA could use such dephasing to test the dynamical\ntheory to unprecedented levels.",

The results are used to constrain important fundamental\nparameters describing the strength of the interaction of various cosmic fields\nwith electrons, protons, and neutrons. Candidates for such fields are dark\nmatter (including axions) and dark energy, as well as several more exotic\nsources described by standard-model extensions. Existing parity nonconservation\nexperiments in Cs, Dy, Yb, and Tl are combined with our calculations to\ndirectly place limits on the interaction strength between the temporal\ncomponent, b_0, of a static pseudovector cosmic field and the atomic electrons,\nwith the most stringent limit of |b_0^e| < 7*10^(-15) GeV, in the laboratory\nframe of reference, coming from Dy. From a measurement of the nuclear anapole\nmoment of Cs, and a limit on its value for Tl, we also extract limits on the\ninteraction strength between the temporal component of this cosmic field, as\nwell as a related tensor cosmic-field component d_00, with protons and\nneutrons.

Axions may\ninduce oscillating P- and T-violating effects in atoms and molecules through\nthe generation of oscillating nuclear magnetic quadrupole and Schiff moments,\nwhich arise from P- and T-odd intranuclear forces and from the electric dipole\nmoments of constituent nucleons.

    "abstract": "In a typical MIMO radar scenario, transmit nodes transmit orthogonal\nwaveforms, while each receive node performs matched filtering with the known\nset of transmit waveforms, and forwards the results to the fusion center. Based\non the data it receives from multiple antennas, the fusion center formulates a\nmatrix, which, in conjunction with standard array processing schemes, such as\nMUSIC, leads to target detection and parameter estimation. In MIMO radars with\ncompressive sensing (MIMO-CS), the data matrix is formulated by each receive\nnode forwarding a small number of compressively obtained samples. In this\npaper, it is shown that under certain conditions, in both sampling cases, the\ndata matrix at the fusion center is low-rank, and thus can be recovered based\non knowledge of a small subset of its entries via matrix completion (MC)\ntechniques. Leveraging the low-rank property of that matrix, we propose a new\nMIMO radar approach, termed, MIMO-MC radar, in which each receive node either\nperforms matched filtering with a small number of randomly selected dictionary\nwaveforms or obtains sub-Nyquist samples of the received signal at random\nsampling instants, and forwards the results to a fusion center. Based on the\nreceived samples, and with knowledge of the sampling scheme, the fusion center\npartially fills the data matrix and subsequently applies MC techniques to\nestimate the full matrix. MIMO-MC radars share the advantages of the recently\nproposed MIMO-CS radars, i.e., high resolution with reduced amounts of data,\nbut unlike MIMO-CS radars do not require grid discretization. The MIMO-MC radar\nconcept is illustrated through a linear uniform array configuration, and its\ntarget estimation performance is demonstrated via simulations.",

The TL1 penalty interpolates $l_0$ and $l_1$ norms through a\nnonnegative parameter $a \\in (0,+\\infty)$, similar to $l_p$ with $p \\in (0,1]$,\nand is known to satisfy unbiasedness, sparsity and Lipschitz continuity\nproperties. We first consider the constrained minimization problem and discuss\nthe exact recovery of $l_0$ norm minimal solution based on the null space\nproperty (NSP). We then prove the stable recovery of $l_0$ norm minimal\nsolution if the sensing matrix $A$ satisfies a restricted isometry property\n(RIP). Next, we present difference of convex algorithms for TL1 (DCATL1) in\ncomputing TL1-regularized constrained and unconstrained problems in CS.

For the unconstrained\nproblem, we prove convergence of DCATL1 to a stationary point satisfying the\nfirst order optimality condition. In numerical experiments, we identify the\noptimal value $a=1$, and compare DCATL1 with other CS algorithms on two classes\nof sensing matrices: Gaussian random matrices and over-sampled discrete cosine\ntransform matrices (DCT). We find that for both classes of sensing matrices,\nthe performance of DCATL1 algorithm (initiated with $l_1$ minimization) always\nranks near the top (if not the top), and is the most robust choice insensitive\nto the conditioning of the sensing matrix $A$. DCATL1 is also competitive in\ncomparison with DCA on other non-convex penalty functions commonly used in\nstatistics with two hyperparameters.",

    "title": "Pulsed excitation of Rydberg-atom-pair states in an ultracold Cs gas",
    "abstract": "Pulsed laser excitation of a dense ultracold Cs vapor has been used to study\nthe pairwise interactions between Cs atoms excited to $n$p$_{3/2}$ Rydberg\nstates of principal quantum numbers in the range $n=22-36$. Molecular\nresonances were observed that correspond to excitation of Rydberg-atom-pair\nstates correlated not only to the $n$p$_{3/2}+n$p$_{3/2}$ dissociation\nasymptotes, but also to $n$s$_{1/2}+(n+1)$s$_{1/2}$, $n$s$_{1/2}+n'$f$_{j}$,\nand $(n-4)$f$_{j}+(n-3)$f$_{j}$ $(j=5/2,7/2)$ dissociation asymptotes. These\npair resonances are interpreted as arising from dipole-dipole, and higher-order\nlong-range-interaction terms between the Rydberg atoms on the basis of i) their\nspectral positions, ii) their response to static and pulsed electric fields,\nand iii) millimeter-wave spectra between pair states correlated to different\npair-dissociation asymptotes. The Rydberg-atom--pair states were found to\nspontaneously decay by Penning ionization and the dynamics of the ionization\nprocess were investigated during the first 10 $\\mu$s following initial\nphotoexcitation. To interpret the experimental observations, a potential model\nwas derived that is based on the numerical determination of the eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions of the long-range interaction Hamiltonian. With this potential\nmodel, which does not include adjustable parameters, all experimental\nobservations could be accounted for, and the results demonstrate that\nlong-range-interaction models provide a global and accurate description of\ninteractions in ultracold Rydberg gases and that they correctly account for,\nand enable the analysis of, phenomena as diverse as the formation of Rydberg\nmacrodimers, Penning ionization in dense Rydberg gases, and Rydberg-excitation\nblockade effects.",

    "title": "Block Compressed Sensing Based Distributed Device Detection for M2M\n  Communications",
    "abstract": "In this work, we utilize the framework of compressed sensing (CS) for\ndistributed device detection and resource allocation in large-scale\nmachine-to-machine (M2M) communication networks. The devices deployed in the\nnetwork are partitioned into clusters according to some pre-defined criteria.\nMoreover, the devices in each cluster are assigned a unique signature of a\nparticular design that can be used to indicate their active status to the\nnetwork. The proposed scheme in this work mainly consists of two essential\nsteps: (i) The base station (BS) detects the active clusters and the number of\nactive devices in each cluster using a novel block sketching algorithm, and\nthen assigns a certain amount of resources accordingly. (ii) Each active device\ndetects its ranking among all the active devices in its cluster using an\nenhanced greedy algorithm and accesses the corresponding resource for\ntransmission based on the ranking. By exploiting the correlation in the device\nbehaviors and the sparsity in the activation pattern of the M2M devices, the\ndevice detection problem is thus tackled as a CS support recovery procedure for\na particular binary block-sparse signal $x\\in\\mathbb{B}^N$ -- with block\nsparsity $K_B$ and in-block sparsity $K_I$ over block size $d$. Theoretical\nanalysis shows that the activation pattern of the M2M devices can be reliably\nreconstructed within an acquisition time of $\\mathcal{O}(\\max\\{K_B\\log N,\nK_BK_I\\log d\\})$, which achieves a better scaling and less computational\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N(K_I^2+\\log N))$ compared with standard CS\nalgorithms. Moreover, extensive simulations confirm the robustness of the\nproposed scheme in the detection process, especially in terms of higher\ndetection probability and reduced access delay when compared with conventional\nschemes like LTE random access (RA) procedure and classic cluster-based access\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "Finding hot topics in scholarly fields can help researchers to keep up with\nthe latest concepts, trends, and inventions in their field of interest. Due to\nthe rarity of complete large-scale scholarly data, earlier studies target this\nproblem based on manual topic extraction from a limited number of domains, with\ntheir focus solely on a single feature such as coauthorship, citation\nrelations, and etc. Given the compromised effectiveness of such predictions, in\nthis paper we use a real scholarly dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph, which\nprovides more than 12000 topics in the field of Computer Science (CS),\nincluding 1200 venues, 14.4 million authors, 30 million papers and their\ncitation relations over the period of 1950 till now. Aiming to find the topics\nthat will trend in CS area, we innovatively formalize a hot topic prediction\nproblem where, with joint consideration of both inter- and intra-topical\ninfluence, 17 different scientific features are extracted for comprehensive\ndescription of topic status. By leveraging all those 17 features, we observe\ngood accuracy of topic scale forecasting after 5 and 10 years with R2 values of\n0.9893 and 0.9646, respectively. Interestingly, our prediction suggests that\nthe maximum value matters in finding hot topics in scholarly fields, primarily\nfrom three aspects: (1) the maximum value of each factor, such as authors'\nmaximum h-index and largest citation number, provides three times the amount of\ninformation than the average value in prediction; (2) the mutual influence\nbetween the most correlated topics serve as the most telling factor in\nlong-term topic trend prediction, interpreting that those currently exhibiting\nthe maximum growth rates will drive the correlated topics to be hot in the\nfuture; (3) we predict in the next 5 years the top 100 fastest growing (maximum\ngrowth rate) topics that will potentially get the major attention in CS area.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method for efficient implementation of a\nmassive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (massive MIMO) system with Frequency\nDivision Duplexing (FDD) operation. Our main objective is to reduce the large\noverhead incurred by Downlink (DL) common training and Uplink (UL) feedback\nneeded to obtain channel state information (CSI) at the base station. Our\nproposed scheme relies on the fact that the underlying angular distribution of\na channel vector, also known as the angular scattering function, is a\nfrequency-invariant entity yielding a UL-DL reciprocity and has a limited\nangular support. We estimate this support from UL CSI and interpolate it to\nobtain the corresponding angular support of the DL channel. Finally we exploit\nthe estimated support of the DL channel of all the users to design an efficient\nchannel probing and feedback scheme that maximizes the total spectral\nefficiency of the system. Our method is different from the existing\ncompressed-sensing (CS) based techniques in the literature. Using support\ninformation helps reduce the feedback overhead from O(s*log M) in CS techniques\nto O(s) in our proposed method, with $s$ and $M$ being sparsity order of the\nchannel vectors and the number of base station antennas, respectively.\nFurthermore, in order to control the channel sparsity and therefore the DL\ncommon training and UL feedback overhead, we introduce the novel concept of\nactive channel sparsification. In brief, when the fixed pilot dimension is less\nthan the required amount for reliable channel estimation, we introduce a\npre-beamforming matrix that artificially reduces the effective channel\ndimension of each user to be not larger than the DL pilot dimension, while\nmaximizing both the number of served users and the number of probed angles. We\nprovide numerical experiments to compare our method with the state-of-the-art\nCS technique.",

    "abstract": "Debris discs have often been described as gas-poor discs as the gas-to-dust\nratio is expected to be considerably lower than in primordial,protoplanetary\ndiscs. However, recent observations have confirmed the presence of a\nnon-negligible amount of cold gas in the circumstellar (CS) debris discs around\nyoung main-sequence stars.This cold gas has been suggested to be related to the\noutgassing of planetesimals and cometary-like objects. The aim of the paper is\nto investigate the presence of hot gas in the surroundings of stars bearing\ncold-gas debris discs. High-resolution optical spectra of all currently known\ncold-gas-bearing debris-disc systems, with the exception of $\\beta$ Pic and\nFomalhaut, have been obtained from different observatories.We have analysed the\nCa II H & K and the Na I D lines searching for non-photospheric absorptions of\nCS origin, usually attributed to cometary-like activity. Narrow, stable Ca II\nand/or Na I absorption features have been detected superimposed to the\nphotospheric lines in 10 out of the 15 observed cold-gas-bearing debris\ndisc.Features are found at the radial velocity of the stars, or slightly blue-\nor red-shifted, and/or at the velocity of the local interstellar medium (ISM).\nSome stars also present transient variable events or absorptions extended\ntowards red wavelengths. These are the first detections of such Ca II features\nin 7 out of the 15 observed stars. In some of these stars, results suggest that\nthe stable and variable absorptions arise from relatively hot gas located in\nthe CS close-in environment. This hot gas is detected in at least ~80%, of\nedge-on cold-gas-bearing debris discs, while in only ~10% of the discs seen\nclose to face-on. We interpret this as a geometrical effect, and suggest that\nthe non-detection of hot gas absorptions is due to the disc inclination rather\nthan to the absence of the hot-gas component.",

Unlike Dutch, Frisian is a low-resourced language with a very\nlimited amount of manually annotated speech data. In this paper, we describe\nseveral automatic annotation approaches to enable using of a large amount of\nraw bilingual broadcast data for acoustic model training in a semi-supervised\nsetting. Previously, it has been shown that the best-performing ASR system is\nobtained by two-stage multilingual deep neural network (DNN) training using 11\nhours of manually annotated CS speech (reference) data together with speech\ndata from other high-resourced languages. We compare the quality of\ntranscriptions provided by this bilingual ASR system with several other\napproaches that use a language recognition system for assigning language labels\nto raw speech segments at the front-end and using monolingual ASR resources for\ntranscription. We further investigate automatic annotation of the speakers\nappearing in the raw broadcast data by first labeling with (pseudo) speaker\ntags using a speaker diarization system and then linking to the known speakers\nappearing in the reference data using a speaker recognition system. These\nspeaker labels are essential for speaker-adaptive training in the proposed\nsetting. We train acoustic models using the manually and automatically\nannotated data and run recognition experiments on the development and test data\nof the FAME! speech corpus to quantify the quality of the automatic\nannotations.

To ensure continuity with the current definition, based on a\nmicrowave transition between hyperfine levels in ground-state $^{133}$Cs, it is\nnecessary to measure the absolute frequency of candidate standards, which is\ndone by comparing against a primary cesium reference. A key verification of\nthis process can be achieved by performing a loop closure$-$comparing frequency\nratios derived from absolute frequency measurements against ratios determined\nfrom direct optical comparisons.

    "abstract": "A topological concern is addressed in view of the extensively and intensively\nstudied topological phases of condensed matter. In this realm, the phases with\ntopological order cannot be characterized by symmetry alone. Moreover, the\nrelevant phase transitions do occur without spontaneous symmetry breaking,\nbeyond the scope of Landau's theory. The first realization of such phases is\nthe discovery of the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE), which was followed soon\nby a topological interpretation. Later on, a distinct, half-integer QHE was\nalso found from graphene, which has almost spin degeneracy described by $SU(2)$\nsymmetry. The previous theoretical predictions were realized in this finding.\nIt has been well understood that the anomaly of this half-integer QHE\noriginates from the presence of $2$D massless Dirac fermions around the zero\nenergy with respect to the original Dirac points (DPs). The very characteristic\nlies in that there exists a topologically robust zero-mode LL that is a\nconstant function of the perpendicular magnetic field. More deeply, this\nzero-mode LL is protected by the local chiral symmetry (CS), against CS\npreserving perturbations provided that intervalley scattering between the\ndouble DPs is inhibited, where the CS arises from the global sublattice\nsymmetry in spinless graphene. Since massless Dirac particles are broadly\npresent in condensed matter with various symmetries, not to mention Dirac\nbosonic systems, it is of interest to see how about the situations in other\nsystems with $2$D massless Dirac fermions. We address several notes in a\ntopological viewpoint on the presence of $2$D massless Dirac fermions in $3$D\nlayered systems.In particular, we focus on the zero-mode LL since this LL\nsignifies $2$D massless Dirac fermions.",

As of today, only a handful of disks has been imaged in multiple\nspectral lines with high spatial resolution. As part of a small campaign\ndevoted to the chemical characterization of disk-outflow sources in Taurus, we\nreport on new ALMA Band 6 observations with 20 au resolution toward the\nembedded young star DG Tau B. Images of the continuum emission reveals a dust\ndisk with rings and, putatively, a leading spiral arm. The disk, as well as the\nprominent outflow cavities, are detected in CO, H2CO, CS, and CN while they\nremain undetected in SO2, HDO, and CH3OH. From the absorption of the back-side\noutflow, we inferred that the disk emission is optically thick in the inner 50\nau. This morphology explains why no line emission is detected from this inner\nregion and poses some limitations toward the calculation of the dust mass and\nthe characterization of the inner gaseous disk. The H2CO and CS emission from\nthe inner 200 au is mostly from the disk and their morphology is very similar.\nThe CN emission significantly differs from the other two molecules as it is\nobserved only beyond 150 au. This ring-like morphology is consistent with\nprevious observations and the predictions of thermochemical disk models.\nFinally, we constrained the disk-integrated column density of all molecules. In\nparticular, we found that the CH3OH/H2CO ratio must be smaller than 2, making\nthe methanol non-detection still consistent with the only such a ratio\navailable from the literature (1.27 in TW Hya).",

    "abstract": "A large number of new members ($\\sim$150) of the Cetus Stream (CS) were\nidentified from their clustering features in dynamical space using 6D kinematic\ndata by combining LAMOST DR5 and Gaia DR2 surveys. They map a diffuse structure\nthat extends over at least 100 degrees in the northern and southern Galactic\nhemispheres, at heliocentric distances between 20 to 50 kpc. Taking advantage\nof this expanded dataset, we model the stream with a suite of tailored N-body\nsimulations. Our findings exclude the possibility that the NGC 5824 globular\ncluster is the core of the progenitor of the stream, as postulated by previous\nstudies. Our best models, which successfully reproduce the features of the CS\nindicate that the progenitor is likely a dwarf galaxy of $\\sim$\n2$\\times$10$^9$M$_{\\odot}$, with a diffuse disc morphology. The merger occured\n$\\sim$ 5 Gyr ago and since then it has experienced approximately eight\napo-center passages. Our results suggest that NGC 5824 was either a globular\ncluster situated off-centre in the dwarf progenitor or, alternatively, it was\nthe nuclear star cluster of another dwarf galaxy that has very similar orbit as\nthe progenitor of the CS. In both scenarios, the progenitor systems would leave\nstreams around NGC 5824, but with distinct distance distributions. To\ndiscriminate between these scenarios, the detection and accurate distance\nmeasurements of the predicted stream around the GC are crucial, which will be\npossible in the upcoming LSST era. Our simulations also predict that part of\nthe Southern Cetus stream is very likely the newly discovered Palca stream, and\npossibly related to another, more diffuse Southern substructure, the\nEridanus-Pheonix overdensity.",

    "abstract": "All metaheuristic optimization algorithms require some initialization, and\nthe initialization for such optimizers is usually carried out randomly.\nHowever, initialization can have some significant influence on the performance\nof such algorithms. This paper presents a systematic comparison of 22 different\ninitialization methods on the convergence and accuracy of five optimizers:\ndifferential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), cuckoo search\n(CS), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). We have\nused 19 different test functions with different properties and modalities to\ncompare the possible effects of initialization, population sizes and the\nnumbers of iterations. Rigorous statistical ranking tests indicate that 43.37\\%\nof the functions using the DE algorithm show significant differences for\ndifferent initialization methods, while 73.68\\% of the functions using both PSO\nand CS algorithms are significantly affected by different initialization\nmethods. The simulations show that DE is less sensitive to initialization,\nwhile both PSO and CS are more sensitive to initialization. In addition, under\nthe condition of the same maximum number of function evaluations (FEs), the\npopulation size can also have a strong effect. Particle swarm optimization\nusually requires a larger population, while the cuckoo search needs only a\nsmall population size. Differential evolution depends more heavily on the\nnumber of iterations, a relatively small population with more iterations can\nlead to better results. Furthermore, ABC is more sensitive to initialization,\nwhile such initialization has little effect on GA. Some probability\ndistributions such as the beta distribution, exponential distribution and\nRayleigh distribution can usually lead to better performance. The implications\nof this study and further research topics are also discussed in detail.",

We present an exact\ncharged black hole solution to the theory surrounded by clouds of string (CS)\nand also analyze their thermodynamic properties to calculate exact expressions\nfor the black hole mass, temperature, and entropy. Owing to the corrected black\nhole due to the background CS, the thermodynamic quantities have also been\ncorrected except for the entropy, which remains unaffected by a CS background.\nHowever, as a result of the novel $4D$ EGB theory, the Bekenstein-Hawking area\nlaw turns out to be corrected by a logarithmic area term. The heat capacity\n$C_+$ diverges at a critical radius $r=r_C$, where incidentally the temperature\nhas a maximum, and the Hawking-Page transitions even in absence of the\ncosmological term and $C_+ > 0$ for $r_+ < r_C$ allowing the black hole to\nbecome thermodynamically stable. In addition, the smaller black holes are\nglobally preferred with negative free energy $F_+<0$. Our solution can also be\nidentified as a $4D$ monopole-charged EGB black hole.

    "abstract": "Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic\ndisease in over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the\ninfection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial\nstep. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain\nReaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high\nenough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a\nvaluable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the\npatients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan\ntest is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This\npaper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to\nperform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS\nsystem, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation\n(COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and\n350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with\nfine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased\nattenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts,\nopacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is\nvery efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an\naverage sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification\ntest set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Parity-violating (PV) gravity has recently attracted interest in several\naspects. One of them is the axion-graviton coupling to test the axion-dark\nmatter model. Moreover, by extending Chern-Simons (CS) gravity to include\nderivatives of a scalar field up to the second order, a more general class of\nPV gravity theory, which we call the CNCL model, has been proposed~[M.\nCrisostomi {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. D, {\\bf 97}, 044034 (2018)]. The model can\nbe further extended by including even higher derivatives of the scalar field\nand/or higher curvature terms. In this paper, we discuss the effect of parity\nviolation in the gravitational sector on the propagation of gravitational waves\nfrom binary coalescence by introducing a model-independent parametrization of\nmodification. Our parametrization includes the CNCL model as well as CS\ngravity. The effect of parity violation on the gravitational waveform is\nmaximum when the source binary orientation to our line of sight is edge-on,\nwhile the modified waveform reduces to the parity-symmetric one when the source\nis face-on. We perform a search for the signature of such modification by using\nthe LIGO/Virgo O1/O2 catalog. We find that the catalog data is consistent with\ngeneral relativity and obtain constraints on parity violation in gravity for\nvarious post-Newtonian order modifications for the first time. The obtained\nconstraint on CS gravity is consistent with the results in previous works. On\nthe other hand, the constraint on the CNCL model that we obtain is tighter than\nthe previous results by roughly 7 orders of magnitude.",

In its\ncore (40' in radius), approximately 110 OB candidate stars (Ks < 10 mag and 0.4\n< AKs < 1.6 mag) were identified using 2MASS, DENIS, and GLIMPSE data. This\nnumber of OB stars accounts for more than 50% of the observed number of Lyman\ncontinuum photons from this region.

To analyse the\nobserved distributions in light of the H2CS binding energy, in order to discuss\nthe role of thermal desorption in enriching the gas disk component. Methods: In\nthe context of the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in the Taurus\nstar forming region (ALMA-DOT), we observed five Class I or early Class II\nsources with the o-H2CS(7_1,6-6_1,5) line on a 40 au scale. We estimated the\nbinding energy (BEs) of H2CS using quantum mechanical calculations, for the\nfirst time, for an extended, periodic, crystalline ice. Results: We imaged H2CS\nin two rotating molecular rings in the HL Tau and IRAS04302+2247 disks. The\nouter radii are about 140 au (HL Tau), and 115 au (IRAS 04302+2247). The\nedge-on geometry of IRAS 04302+2247 reveals that H2CS emission peaks, at radii\nof 60-115 au, at z = +- 50 au from the equatorial plane. The column densities\nare about 10^14 cm^-2. For HL Tau, we derive, for the first time, the\n[H2CS]/[H] abundance in a protoplanetary disk (about 10^-14). The BEs of H2CS\ncomputed for extended crystalline ice and amorphous ices is 4258 K and\n3000-4600 K, respectively, implying a thermal evaporation where dust\ntemperature is larger than 50-80 K. Conclusions: H2CS traces the so-called warm\nmolecular layer, a region previously sampled using CS, and H2CO.\nThioformaldehyde peaks closer to the protostar than H2CO and CS, plausibly due\nto the relatively high-excitation level of observed 7_1,6-6_1,5 line (60 K).\nThe H2CS BEs implies that thermal desorption dominates in thin, au-sized, inner\nand/or upper disk layers, indicating that the observed H2CS emitting up to\nradii larger than 100 au is likely injected in the gas due to non-thermal\nprocesses.",

This\nwork presents spectrally integrated flux maps, autocorrelation spectra,\nproduction rates, and parent scale lengths for each molecule, and a stringent\nupper limit for CO. HCN is consistent with direct nucleus release in C/2015\nER61, whereas CS, H$_2$CO, HNC, and potentially CH$_3$OH are associated with\ndistributed sources in the coma. Adopting a Haser model, parent scale lengths\ndetermined for H$_2$CO (L$_p$ $\\sim$ 2200 km) and HNC (L$_p$ $\\sim$ 3300 km)\nare consistent with previous work in comets, whereas significant extended\nsource production (L$_p$ $\\sim$ 2000 km) is indicated for CS, suggesting\nproduction from an unknown parent in the coma. The continuum presents a\npoint-source distribution, with a flux density implying an excessively large\nnucleus, inconsistent with other estimates of the nucleus size. It is best\nexplained by the thermal emission of slowly-moving outburst ejectas, with total\nmass 5--8 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ kg.

It has to be mentioned that the shape of the pulse was maintained\n(cf. fig. 4 of 1), so that its peak was not shifted forward inside the pulse.\nThus the explanation that the peak of the pulse was advanced at the exit, with\nthe result of emerging there before the entrance of the peak of the incident\npulse, does not apply.",

An encapsulated cesium atom donates an electron to the nanotube and\nproduces donor-like states below the conduction bands. In contrast, an iodine\ntrimer (I$_{3}$) accepts an electron from the nanotube and produces an\nacceptor-like state above the valance band maximum.

    "abstract": "Compressed sensing (CS) demonstrates that a sparse, or compressible signal\ncan be acquired using a low rate acquisition process below the Nyquist rate,\nwhich projects the signal onto a small set of vectors incoherent with the\nsparsity basis. In this paper, we propose a new framework for compressed\nsensing recovery problem using iterative approximation method via L0\nminimization. Instead of directly solving the unconstrained L0 norm\noptimization problem, we use the linearization and proximal points techniques\nto approximate the penalty function at each iteration. The proposed algorithm\nis very simple, efficient, and proved to be convergent. Numerical simulation\ndemonstrates our conclusions and indicates that the algorithm can improve the\nreconstruction quality.",

We find that, when $k_1+k_2=0$, the partition\nfunction computed by localization dramatically simplifies and collapses to a\nsingle term. We show that the same condition prevents the theory from having\nsupersymmetric vortex configurations. The theories include mass-deformed ABJM\ntheory with $U(1)_{k}\\times U_{-k}(1)$ gauge group as a particular case.\nSimilar features are shared by a class of CS-matter theories with gauge group\n$U_{k_1}(1)\\times \\cdots \\times U_{k_N}(1)$.",

As an application, Sz\\H{u}cs used it\nto compute cobordism groups of immersions and embeddings in dimensions where\nthe classical theory did not succeed. His method of studying cobordism groups\nof singular maps involves the investigation of classifying spaces that were\nconstructed by him, first in a few special cases, then, with the help of the\nwork of Rim\\'anyi, in complete generality. Since then quite a few results and\n(partial) computations were performed in this theory. The present thesis\ncollects and organises these results of Sz\\H{u}cs, Terpai and other coauthors\ntowards and on the computation of cobordism groups of singular maps.",

The s-process elements Sr and Ba are,\nsurprisingly, found to be under-abundant relative to solar, with [Sr/Fe]=-0.91\nand [Ba/Fe]=-0.93. The star's low luminosity requires that the chemical\nenrichment arises from mass transfer from an evolved companion, rather than\nself-polluting dredge-up processes. However, the s-process elements Sr and Ba\nare unusually low, with a solar ratio to one another, at variance with what\nfound in the ``classical'' CH stars. Finally we note that a feature due to 13CH\nis present in coincidence with the Th II 401.9129 nm resonance line. The blend\nis of relevance for the nucleo-chronology use of the Th II line in these\nextremely metal poor stars, when significant 13C is present.",

The low abundance of all the objects has been confirmed with\nmetallicity reaching [Fe/H]=-2.9. However, for three objects, the astrometric\ndata from the Hipparcos catalogue suggests they are true halo members. The\nremaining two, for which proper-motion data are not available, may have\ndisc-like kinematics. It is therefore clear that it is useful to address\nproperties of putative metal-weak thick-disc stars only if they possess full\nkinematic data. For CS 22894-19 the abundance pattern similar to those of\ntypical halo stars is found, suggesting that chemical composition is not a\nuseful discriminant between thick-disc and halo stars. CS 29529-12 is found to\nbe C enhanced with [C/Fe]=+1.0; other chemical peculiarities involve the s\nprocess elements: [Sr/Fe]=-0.65 and [Ba/Fe]=+0.62, leading to a high [Ba/Sr]\nconsiderably larger than what is found in more metal-rich carbon-rich stars,\nbut similar to LP 706-7 and LP 625-44 discussed by Norris et al (1997a).\nHipparcos data have been used to calculate the space velocities of 25 candidate\nmetal-weak thick-disc stars, thus allowing us to identify 3 bona fide members,\nwhich support the existence of a metal-poor tail of the thick-disc, at variance\nwith a claim to the contrary by Ryan & Lambert (1995).",

Evolutional status of this\nsource has been evoking a controversy since its discovery, though SiO maser\nsources are usually identified as late-type stars with active mass loss. In\nline profiles, two kinematical components are found as reported in previous\nsingle-dish observations: a broad pedestal component and a narrow component.\nSpatio-kinetic properties of a broad component region traced by 12CO lines are\nroughly explained by a simple spherical outflow model with a typical expanding\nvelocity of an AGB star, though some properties of the broad component region\nstill conflict with properties of a typical AGB spherical outflow. A narrow\ncomponent region apparently exhibits a bipolar flow. The angular size of the\nnarrow component region is spatially larger than that of a broad component\nregion. Intensity distribution of the CS emission avoids the central region of\nthe source, and that of an SO broad component emission exhibits a small feature\npeaked exactly at the mapping center. According to the present results, if a\nbroad component really originates in a spherical outflow, an oxygen-rich\nevolved stellar object seems to be a natural interpretation for the central\nstar of IRAS 19312+1950.",

    "abstract": "We found that in regions of high mass star formation the CS emission\ncorrelates well with the dust continuum emission and is therefore a good tracer\nof the total mass while the N$_2$H$^+$ distribution is frequently very\ndifferent. This is opposite to their typical behavior in low-mass cores where\nfreeze-out plays a crucial role in the chemistry. The behavior of other high\ndensity tracers varies from source to source but most of them are closer to CS.\nRadial density profiles in massive cores are fitted by power laws with indices\nabout -1.6, as derived from the dust continuum emission. The radial temperature\ndependence on intermediate scales is close to the theoretically expected one\nfor a centrally heated optically thin cloud. The velocity dispersion either\nremains constant or decreases from the core center to the edge. Several cores\nincluding those without known embedded IR sources show signs of infall motions.\nThey can represent the earliest phases of massive protostars. There are\nimplicit arguments in favor of small-scale clumpiness in the cores.",

Using a\nphysical model of core structure and a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we\ndetermine for each core a self-consistent set abundances that fits\nsimultaneously the observed radial profile of integrated intensity and the\nemergent spectrum towards the core center (for abundant species, optically thin\nisopologues are used). From this work, we find that L1498 and L1517B have\nsimilar abundance patterns, with most species suffering a significant drop\ntoward the core center. This occurs for CO, CS, CH3OH, SO, C3H2, HC3N, C2S,\nHCN, H2CO, HCO+, and DCO+, which we fit with profiles having a sharp central\nhole. The size of this hole varies with molecule: DCO+, HCN, and HC3N have the\nsmallest holes while SO, C2S and CO have the largest holes. Only N2H+ and NH3\nare present in the gas phase at the core centers. From the different behavior\nof molecules, we select SO, C2S, and CH3OH as the most sensitive tracers of\nmolecular depletion. Comparing our abundance determinations with the\npredictions from current chemical models we find order of magnitude\ndiscrepancies. Finally, we show how the ``contribution function'' can be used\nto study the formation of line profiles from the different regions of a core.",

Photodissociation regions (PDRs) are\nan interesting intermediate medium between translucent and dark clouds where\nthe chemistry and energetics are dominated by the illuminating FUV radiation\nfield. Thus they can provide new insights about the sulfur depletion problem.\nHowever, physical and chemical gradients in PDRs take place at small angular\nscales (~1 to 10''). Aperture synthesis observations are therefore required to\nresolve such gradients. Besides, a complete understanding of molecular\nexcitation is needed to correctly determine molecular abundances but also the\npreavailing physical conditions. Hence, multi-J observations at increasing\nfrequencies are also required. Such high angular resolution and broad frequency\ncoverage observations will be provided by ALMA in the near future.

For the simple su(1,1) the family of\neigenstates of uK_- + vK_+ (K_\\pm being lowering and raising operators) is a\nfamily of ideal K_1-K_2 SS, but it cannot be represented as an Aut(su^C(1,1))\norbit although the SU(1,1) group related coherent states (CS) with symmetry are\ncontained in it.\n  Eigenstates |z,u,v,w;k> of general combination uK_- + vK_+ + wK_3 of the\nthree generators K_j of SU(1,1) in the representations with Bargman index k =\n1/2,1, ..., and k = 1/4,3/4 are constructed and discussed in greater detail.\nThese are ideal SS for K_{1,2,3}. In the case of the one mode realization of\nsu(1,1) the nonclassical properties (sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature\nsqueezing) of the generalized even CS |z,u,v;+> are demonstrated. The states\n|z,u,v,w;k=1/4,3/4> can exhibit strong both linear and quadratic squeezing.",

In particular, we derive the high-rate scaling law for MP\ndecoding of LDPC codes on the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the $q$-ary\nsymmetric channel ($q$-SC). For the BEC, the density evolution (DE) threshold\nof iterative decoding scales like $\\Theta(k^{-1})$ and the critical stopping\nratio scales like $\\Theta(k^{-j/(j-2)})$. For the $q$-SC, the DE threshold of\nverification decoding depends on the details of the decoder and scales like\n$\\Theta(k^{-1})$ for one decoder.\n  Using the fact that coding over large finite alphabets is very similar to\ncoding over the real numbers, the analysis of verification decoding is also\nextended to the the compressed sensing (CS) of strictly-sparse signals. A DE\nbased approach is used to analyze the CS systems with randomized-reconstruction\nguarantees. This leads to the result that strictly-sparse signals can be\nreconstructed efficiently with high-probability using a constant oversampling\nratio (i.e., when the number of measurements scales linearly with the sparsity\nof the signal).

(2) In Pelling et al, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was\nused to find that the cell wall of yeast cells periodically oscillates on\nnano-scale amplitudes at frequencies of 0.8 to 1.6 kHz, and that the\noscillations are generated metabolically. We propose that the spicules, in\ncontact with the cell's power systems, could perform high frequency motions\ngenerating acoustic streaming (AS) in the surrounding fluid. We compare two\nmodels for self-propulsion employing acoustic streaming: the quartz wind effect\n(QW) and boundary induced streaming generated by surface acoustic waves (SAW).",

    "abstract": "The 30 Doradus region in the Large Magellanic Cloud is one of the most\noutstanding star forming regions of the Local Group and a primary target to\nstudy star formation in an environment of low metallicity. In order to obtain a\nmore complete picture of the not yet consumed or dispersed cool gas, we\nsearched for line emission from molecular clouds that could be associated with\nmolecular hydrogen emission detected in the region. We obtained a high\nsensitivity 12CO J=2-1 map with the 15-m SEST telescope, complemented by\npointed observations of 13CO J=2-1 and CS J=2-1. We report the discovery of a\ndense molecular cloud towards an embedded young massive star at ~ 20\" (~5 pc,\nat the distance of 50 kpc) northwest of R136, the compact massive central\nstellar cluster powering 30 Doradus in the LMC, that could be triggering star\nformation in the surrounding molecular clouds. We derived a molecular mass of\n$\\lesssim 10^4$ \\msol, a linear radius of 3 pc, as an upper limit, and a mean\ndensity of $\\gtrsim 10^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ for the cloud. The detection of CS J=2-1\nemission line indicates larger densities, $\\sim 10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$. The dense\nmolecular cloud is associated with molecular 2.12 um H2 emission. We suggest\nthat the observed molecular gas could be the remains of dense molecular\nmaterial surviving the action of strong UV fields and winds in which the young\nmassive star has formed.",

Finally, we investigate the influence of the carrier dynamics, relevant\nfor VCSELs. We find and analyze qualitative changes in the stability properties\nof resting CSs when increasing the carrier relaxation time. In addition to a\ndrifting instability of resting CSs, a new kind of instability appears for\ncertain ranges of carrier lifetime, leading to a swinging motion of the CS\ncenter position.

    "abstract": "We consider a multi-cell MIMO downlink (network MIMO) where $B$ base-stations\n(BS) with $M$ antennas connected to a central station (CS) serve $K$\nsingle-antenna user terminals (UT). Although many works have shown the\npotential benefits of network MIMO, the conclusion critically depends on the\nunderlying assumptions such as channel state information at transmitters (CSIT)\nand backhaul links. In this paper, by focusing on the impact of partial CSIT,\nwe propose an outage-efficient strategy. Namely, with side information of all\nUT's messages and local CSIT, each BS applies zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in\na distributed manner. For a small number of UTs ($K\\leq M$), the ZF beamforming\ncreates $K$ parallel MISO channels. Based on the statistical knowledge of these\nparallel channels, the CS performs a robust power allocation that\nsimultaneously minimizes the outage probability of all UTs and achieves a\ndiversity gain of $B(M-K+1)$ per UT. With a large number of UTs ($K \\geq M$),\nwe propose a so-called distributed diversity scheduling (DDS) scheme to select\na subset of $\\Ks$ UTs with limited backhaul communication. It is proved that\nDDS achieves a diversity gain of $B\\frac{K}{\\Ks}(M-\\Ks+1)$, which scales\noptimally with the number of cooperative BSs $B$ as well as UTs. Numerical\nresults confirm that even under realistic assumptions such as partial CSIT and\nlimited backhaul communications, network MIMO can offer high data rates with a\nsufficient reliability to individual UTs.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the effect of shear viscosity and Ohmic resistivity on the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) in vertically stratified accretion disks\nthrough a series of local simulations with the Athena code. First, we use a\nseries of unstratified simulations to calibrate physical dissipation as a\nfunction of resolution and background field strength; the effect of the\nmagnetic Prandtl number, Pm = viscosity/resistivity, on the turbulence is\ncaptured by ~32 grid zones per disk scale height, H. In agreement with previous\nresults, our stratified disk calculations are characterized by a subthermal,\npredominately toroidal magnetic field that produces MRI-driven turbulence for\n|z| < 2 H. Above |z| = 2 H, magnetic pressure dominates and the field is\nbuoyantly unstable. Large scale radial and toroidal fields are also generated\nnear the mid-plane and subsequently rise through the disk. The polarity of this\nmean field switches on a roughly 10 orbit period in a process that is\nwell-modeled by an alpha-omega dynamo. Turbulent stress increases with Pm but\nwith a shallower dependence compared to unstratified simulations. For\nsufficiently large resistivity, on the order of cs H/1000, where cs is the\nsound speed, MRI turbulence within 2 H of the mid-plane undergoes periods of\nresistive decay followed by regrowth. This regrowth is caused by amplification\nof toroidal field via the dynamo. This process results in large amplitude\nvariability in the stress on 10 to 100 orbital timescales, which may have\nrelevance for partially ionized disks that are observed to have high and low\naccretion states.",

    "abstract": "We performed the high hydrostatic pressure resistivity measurements (up to\n1.7 GPa) on the newly discovered superconductors $A_{x}$Fe$_2$Se$_2$ ($A$ = K\nand Cs) single crystals. Two batches of single crystals $K_xFe_2Se_2$ with\ndifferent transition temperatures ($T_c$) were used to study the effect of\npressure. The $T_c$ of the first one gradually decreases with increasing\npressure from 32.6 K at ambient pressure. While a dome-like behavior was\nobserved for the crystal with $T_c=31.1$ K, and $T_c$ reaches its maximum value\nof 32.7 K at the pressure of 0.48 GPa. It indicates that there exists a optimal\ndoping with maximum $T_c$ of 32.7K in $K_xFe_2Se_2$ system. The behavior of\n$T_c$ vs. pressure for $Cs_xFe_2Se_2$ also shows a dome-like behavior, and\n$T_c$ reaches its maximum value of 31.1 K at the pressure of 0.82 GPa. The hump\nobserved in temperature dependence of resistivity for all the samples tends to\nshift to high temperature with increasing pressure. The resistivity hump could\narise from the vacancy of Fe or Se.",

    "abstract": "The Random Demodulator (RD) and the Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC) are\ntwo recently proposed compressed sensing (CS) techniques for the acquisition of\ncontinuous-time spectrally-sparse signals. They extend the standard CS paradigm\nfrom sampling discrete, finite dimensional signals to sampling continuous and\npossibly infinite dimensional ones, and thus establish the ability to capture\nthese signals at sub-Nyquist sampling rates. The RD and the MWC have remarkably\nsimilar structures (similar block diagrams), but their reconstruction\nalgorithms and signal models strongly differ. To date, few results exist that\ncompare these systems, and owing to the potential impacts they could have on\nspectral estimation in applications like electromagnetic scanning and cognitive\nradio, we more fully investigate their relationship in this paper. We show that\nthe RD and the MWC are both based on the general concept of random filtering,\nbut employ significantly different sampling functions. We also investigate\nsystem sensitivities (or robustness) to sparse signal model assumptions.\nLastly, we show that \"block convolution\" is a fundamental aspect of the MWC,\nallowing it to successfully sample and reconstruct block-sparse (multiband)\nsignals. Based on this concept, we propose a new acquisition system for\ncontinuous-time signals whose amplitudes are block sparse. The paper includes\ndetailed time and frequency domain analyses of the RD and the MWC that differ,\nsometimes substantially, from published results.",

There exist many\ndeficiencies within the FeSe layers in $A_x$Fe$_2$Se$_2$, while their $T_{\\rm\nc}$ does not change so much. In this sense, superconductivity is robust to the\nFe and Se vacancies. Very high resistivity in the normal state should arise\nfrom such defects in the conducting FeSe layers. $A_x$Fe$_2$Se$_2$ ($A$ = K,\nRb, and Cs) single crystals show the same susceptibility behavior in the normal\nstate, and no anomaly is observed in susceptibility at the hump temperature in\nresistivity.

Seven gas cores are identified in the\nintegrated intensity map of CS(2-1). Among these, core 1 and core 3 have\ncounterparts in the 2.7 millimeter continuum data. We suggest that core 1 and\ncore 3 are star-forming cores that may already or will very soon harbor young\nmassive protostars. The total masses of core 1 estimated from the LTE method\nand dust emission by assuming a gas-to-dust ratio are 5 +- 1 solar masses and\n18 +- 6 solar masses, and that of core 3 are 15 +- 7 solar masses and 11 +- 3\nsolar masses. The spectrum of core 3 shows blue-skewed self-absorption, which\nsuggests gas infall -- a collapsing core. The observed broad linewidths of the\nseven gas cores indicate non-thermal motions. These non-thermal motions can be\ninteractions with nearby outflows or due to the initial turbulence; the former\nis observed, while the role of initial turbulence is less certain. Finally, the\nvirial masses of the gas cores are larger than the LTE masses, which for a\nbound core implies a requirement on the external pressure of ~ 10^8 K/cm^3.

In this paper, we aim to address three key issues seen in these\nmethods; namely, the bias in the redshifts of detected objects, the line of\nsight smearing seen in reconstructions, and the damping of the amplitude of the\nreconstruction relative to the underlying density. We consider the problem\nunder the framework of compressed sensing (CS). Under the assumption that the\ndata are sparse in an appropriate dictionary, we construct a robust estimator\nand employ state-of-the-art convex optimisation methods to reconstruct the\ndensity contrast. For simplicity in implementation, and as a proof of concept\nof our method, we reduce the problem to one-dimension, considering the\nreconstruction along each line of sight independently. Despite the loss of\ninformation this implies, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately\nreproduce cluster haloes up to a redshift of z=1, deeper than state-of-the-art\nlinear methods. We directly compare our method with these linear methods, and\ndemonstrate minimal radial smearing and redshift bias in our reconstructions,\nas well as a reduced damping of the reconstruction amplitude as compared to the\nlinear methods.

    "title": "Estimating Unknown Sparsity in Compressed Sensing",
    "abstract": "In the theory of compressed sensing (CS), the sparsity ||x||_0 of the unknown\nsignal x\\in\\R^p is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it is\ntypically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of CS depend\non knowing ||x||_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven\nway. A second practical concern is that ||x||_0 is a highly unstable function\nof x. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the\nvalue ||x||_0=p is not a useful description of the effective number of\ncoordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsity\ns(x):=||x||_1^2/||x||_2^2, which is a sharp lower bound on ||x||_0. Our\nestimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does not\nrely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation. A\nconfidence interval for s(x) is provided, and its width is shown to have no\ndependence on the signal dimension p. Moreover, this result extends naturally\nto the matrix recovery setting, where a soft version of matrix rank can be\nestimated with analogous guarantees. Finally, we show that the use of\nrandomized measurements is essential to estimating s(x). This is accomplished\nby proving that the minimax risk for estimating s(x) with deterministic\nmeasurements is large when n<<p.",

That is, EMRI signals may be used to test gravity and the\ngeometry of black holes.

A\nprinciple component analysis is performed to characterize correlations between\nthe transitions, star formation and molecular column density. The analysis\nreveals that HCN, HNC, HCO+ and 3 mm continuum are tightly correlated,\nindicating a direct connection to massive star formation.

The detection of the CS J=7-6 line emission in the region reveals\nthat the ultra-compact HII region G045.47+0.0 has not completely disrupted the\ndense gas where it was born. The HCO+ abundance observed towards G045.47+0.0\nsuggests the presence of molecular outflow activity in the region.

Besides,\n1280 MHz and 610 MHz interferometric observations have been done. The cloud has\ncomplex morphological and kinematical structure, including a clumpy dust ring\nand an extended dense core. The ring is probably formed by the \"collect and\ncollapse\" process due to the expansion of neighboring H II region. Nine dust\nclumps in the ring have been deconvolved. Their sizes, masses and peak hydrogen\ncolumn densities are: $\\sim 0.02-0.11$ pc, $\\sim 0.4-8.1 M_{\\odot}$ and $\\sim\n(2.5-11)\\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. Molecular lines are observed\nat two different velocities and have different spatial distributions implying\nstrong chemical differentiation over the region. The CS abundance is enhanced\ntowards the eastern dust clump 2, while the NH$_3$, N$_2$H$^+$, and\nH$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundances are enhanced towards the western clumps. HCN and\nHCO$^+$ do not correlate with the dust probably tracing the surrounding gas.\nNumber densities derived towards selected positions are: $\\sim (0.3-3.2)\\times\n10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. Two western clumps have kinetic temperatures 21 K and 16 K and\nare close to virial equilibrium. The eastern clumps 2 and 3 are more massive,\nhave higher extent of turbulence and are probably more evolved than the western\nones. They show asymmetric CS(2--1) line profiles due to infalling motions\nwhich is confirmed by model calculations. An interaction between ionized and\nneutral material is taking place in the vicinity of the eastern branch of the\nring and probably trigger star formation.",

    "title": "Robust Compressed Sensing Under Matrix Uncertainties",
    "abstract": "Compressed sensing (CS) shows that a signal having a sparse or compressible\nrepresentation can be recovered from a small set of linear measurements. In\nclassical CS theory, the sampling matrix and representation matrix are assumed\nto be known exactly in advance. However, uncertainties exist due to sampling\ndistortion, finite grids of the parameter space of dictionary, etc. In this\npaper, we take a generalized sparse signal model, which simultaneously\nconsiders the sampling and representation matrix uncertainties. Based on the\nnew signal model, a new optimization model for robust sparse signal\nreconstruction is proposed. This optimization model can be deduced with\nstochastic robust approximation analysis. Both convex relaxation and greedy\nalgorithms are used to solve the optimization problem. For the convex\nrelaxation method, a sufficient condition for recovery by convex relaxation is\ngiven; For the greedy algorithm, it is realized by the introduction of a\npre-processing of the sensing matrix and the measurements. In numerical\nexperiments, both simulated data and real-life ECG data based results show that\nthe proposed method has a better performance than the current methods.",

    "abstract": "To fully utilize the spatial multiplexing gains or array gains of massive\nMIMO, the channel state information must be obtained at the transmitter side\n(CSIT). However, conventional CSIT estimation approaches are not suitable for\nFDD massive MIMO systems because of the overwhelming training and feedback\noverhead. In this paper, we consider multi-user massive MIMO systems and deploy\nthe compressive sensing (CS) technique to reduce the training as well as the\nfeedback overhead in the CSIT estimation. The multi-user massive MIMO systems\nexhibits a hidden joint sparsity structure in the user channel matrices due to\nthe shared local scatterers in the physical propagation environment. As such,\ninstead of naively applying the conventional CS to the CSIT estimation, we\npropose a distributed compressive CSIT estimation scheme so that the compressed\nmeasurements are observed at the users locally, while the CSIT recovery is\nperformed at the base station jointly. A joint orthogonal matching pursuit\nrecovery algorithm is proposed to perform the CSIT recovery, with the\ncapability of exploiting the hidden joint sparsity in the user channel\nmatrices. We analyze the obtained CSIT quality in terms of the normalized mean\nabsolute error, and through the closed-form expressions, we obtain simple\ninsights into how the joint channel sparsity can be exploited to improve the\nCSIT recovery performance.",

    "abstract": "In a search scenario, nuclear background spectra are continuously measured in\nshort acquisition intervals with a mobile detector-spectrometer. Detecting\nsources from measured data is difficult because of low signal to noise ratio\n(S/N) of spectra, large and highly varying background due to naturally\noccurring radioactive material (NORM), and line broadening due to limited\nspectral resolution of nuclear detector. We have invented a method for\ndetection of sources using clustering of spectral data. Our method takes\nadvantage of the physical fact that a source not only produces counts in the\nregion of its spectral emission, but also has the effect on the entire detector\nspectrum via Compton continuum. This allows characterizing the low S/N spectrum\nwithout distinct isotopic lines using multiple data features. We have shown\nthat noisy spectra with low S/N can be grouped by overall spectral shape\nsimilarity using a data clustering technique called Dynamic Quantum Clustering\n(DQC). The spectra in the same cluster can then be averaged to enhance S/N of\nthe isotopic spectral line. This would allow for increased accuracy of isotopic\nidentification and lower false alarm rate. Our method was validated in a\nproof-of principle study using a data set of spectra measured in one-second\nintervals with Sodium Iodide detector. The data set consisted of over 7000\nspectra obtained in urban background measurements, and approximately 70\nmeasurements of Cs-137 and Co-60 sources.

We perform local and global analyses for\nthe co-evolutionary model and the corresponding ecological model. In the\nabsence of evolution, the facultative parasite system can have one, two, or\nthree interior equilibria, while the obligate parasite system can have either\none or three interior equilibria.

One can deem the reduced number as an effective\ndimensionality of the set of sparse signals and accordingly, define an\neffective oversampling rate as the ratio between the actual sampling rate and\nthe effective dimensionality. A natural conjecture is that the error of Sigma\nDelta quantization, previously shown to decay with the vanilla oversampling\nrate, should now decay with the effective oversampling rate when carried out in\nthe regime of compressed sensing. Confirming this intuition is one of the main\ngoals in this direction.\n  The study of quantization in CS has so far been limited to proving error\nconvergence results for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian sensing matrices, as the\nnumber of bits and/or the number of samples grow to infinity. In this paper, we\nprovide a first result for the more realistic Fourier sensing matrices. The\nmajor idea is to randomly permute the Fourier samples before feeding them into\nthe quantizer.

    "abstract": "The plasmoid instability may lead to fast magnetic reconnection through long\ncurrent sheets(CS). It is well known that large-Reynolds-number plasmas easily\nbecome turbulent. We address the question whether turbulence enhances the\nenergy conversion rate of plasmoid-unstable current sheets. We carry out\nappropriate numerical MHD simulations, but resolving simultaneously the\nrelevant large-scale (mean-) fields and the corresponding small-scale,\nturbulent, quantities by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) is not\npossible. Hence we investigate the influence of small scale turbulence on large\nscale MHD processes by utilizing a subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence model. We\nverify the applicability of our SGS model and then use it to investigate the\ninfluence of turbulence on the plasmoid instability. We start the simulations\nwith Harris-type and force-free CS equilibria in the presence of a finite guide\nfield in the direction perpendicular to the reconnection plane. We use the DNS\nresults to investigate the growth of the plasmoid instability. The energy and\ncross-helicity due to turbulence are obtained in terms of the mean fields by a\nGaussian filtering formulation from a Reynolds averaging turbulence model. The\ninfluence of turbulence on the reconnection rate of the plasmoid instability is\ninvestigated. To verify the predictions of the SGS-model, the electromotive\nforce (${\\bf\\cal{E}}$) is calculated for the coarse data obtained by filtering\nand compared to the SGS-model. The symmetry breakage with respect to the guide\nfield direction causes a turbulent helicity which reduces the influence of the\napparent turbulent resistivity. The reduced reconnection rate of guide field\nplasmoid reconnection is attributed to a balancing between the different\nphysical effects related to turbulence.",

The demand for high resolution requires high sampling\nrates, while coverage is limited by the pulse repetition frequency.\nConsequently, sampling rate reduction is of high practical value in SAR\nimaging. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm, equivalent to the\nwell-known Range-Doppler method, to process SAR data using the Fourier series\ncoefficients of the raw signals. We then demonstrate how to exploit the\nalgorithm features to reduce sampling rate in both range and azimuth axes and\nprocess the signals at sub-Nyquist rates, by using compressed sensing (CS)\ntools. In particular, we demonstrate recovery of an image using only a portion\nof the received signal's bandwidth and also while dropping a large percentage\nof the transmitted pulses. The complementary pulses may be used to capture\nother scenes within the same coherent processing interval. In addition, we\npropose exploiting the ability to reconstruct the image from narrow bands in\norder to dynamically adapt the transmitted waveform energy to vacant spectral\nbands, paving the way to cognitive SAR. The proposed recovery algorithms form a\nnew CS-SAR imaging method that can be applied to high-resolution SAR data\nacquired at sub-Nyquist rates in range and azimuth. The performance of our\nmethod is assessed using simulated and real data sets. Finally, our approach is\nimplemented in hardware using a previously suggested Xampling radar prototype.",

The singular\nset $\\cS\\subset\\cM$ has a stratification $\\cS^0\\subset\\cS^1\\subset...\\cS$,\nwhere $X\\in \\cS^j$ if no tangent flow at $X$ has more than $j$ symmetries.\nHere, we define quantitative singular strata $\\cS^j_{\\eta,r}$ satisfying\n$\\cup_{\\eta>0}\\cap_{0<r} \\cS^j_{\\eta,r}=\\cS^j$. Sharpening the known parabolic\nHausdorff dimension bound $\\dim \\cS^j\\leq j$, we prove the effective Minkowski\nestimates that the volume of $r$-tubular neighborhoods of $\\cS^j_{\\eta,r}$\nsatisfies $\\Vol (T_r(\\cS^j_{\\eta,r})\\cap B_1)\\leq Cr^{N+2-j-\\varepsilon}$. Our\nprimary application of this is to higher regularity of Brakke flows starting at\n$k$-convex smooth compact embedded hypersurfaces. To this end, we prove that\nfor the flow of $k$-convex hypersurfaces, any backwards selfsimilar limit flow\nwith at least $k$ symmetries is in fact a static multiplicity one plane. Then,\ndenoting by $\\cB_r\\subset\\cM$ the set of points with regularity scale less than\n$r$, we prove that $\\Vol(T_r(\\cB_r))\\leq C r^{n+4-k-\\varepsilon}$. This gives\n$L^p$-estimates for the second fundamental form for any $p<n+1-k$. In fact, the\nestimates are much stronger and give $L^p$-estimates for the inverse of the\nregularity scale. These estimates are sharp. The key technique that we develop\nand apply is a parabolic version of the quantitative stratification method\nintroduced in Cheeger and Naber (arXiv:1103.1819v3) and Cheeger and Naber\n(arXiv:1107.3097v1).",

    "abstract": "We report the nature of transitions from nonsynchronous to complete\nsynchronization (CS) state in arrays of time-delay systems, where the systems\nare coupled with instantaneous diffusive coupling. We demonstrate that the\ntransition to CS occurs distinctly for different coupling configurations. In\nparticular, for unidirectional coupling, locally (microscopically)\nsynchronization transition occurs in a very narrow range of coupling strength\nbut for a global one (macroscopically) it occurs sequentially in a broad range\nof coupling strength preceded by an intermittent synchronization. On the other\nhand, in the case of mutual coupling a very large value of coupling strength is\nrequired for local synchronization and, consequently, all the local subsystems\nsynchronize immediately for the same value of the coupling strength and hence\nglobally synchronization also occurs in a narrow range of the coupling\nstrength. In the transition regime, we observe a new type of synchronization\ntransition where long intervals of high quality synchronization which are\ninterrupted at irregular times by intermittent chaotic bursts simultaneously in\nall the systems, which we designate as global intermittent synchronization\n(GIS). We also relate our synchronization transition results to the above\nspecific types using unstable periodic orbit theory.

    "abstract": "Commonly employed reconstruction algorithms in compressed sensing (CS) use\nthe $L_2$ norm as the metric for the residual error. However, it is well-known\nthat least squares (LS) based estimators are highly sensitive to outliers\npresent in the measurement vector leading to a poor performance when the noise\nno longer follows the Gaussian assumption but, instead, is better characterized\nby heavier-than-Gaussian tailed distributions. In this paper, we propose a\nrobust iterative hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm for reconstructing sparse\nsignals in the presence of impulsive noise. To address this problem, we use a\nLorentzian cost function instead of the $L_2$ cost function employed by the\ntraditional IHT algorithm. We also modify the algorithm to incorporate prior\nsignal information in the recovery process. Specifically, we study the case of\nCS with partially known support. The proposed algorithm is a fast method with\ncomputational load comparable to the LS based IHT, whilst having the advantage\nof robustness against heavy-tailed impulsive noise. Sufficient conditions for\nstability are studied and a reconstruction error bound is derived. We also\nderive sufficient conditions for stable sparse signal recovery with partially\nknown support. Theoretical analysis shows that including prior support\ninformation relaxes the conditions for successful reconstruction. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the Lorentzian-based IHT algorithm significantly\noutperform commonly employed sparse reconstruction techniques in impulsive\nenvironments, while providing comparable performance in less demanding,\nlight-tailed environments. Numerical results also demonstrate that the\npartially known support inclusion improves the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm, thereby requiring fewer samples to yield an approximate\nreconstruction.",

The sampling rates required to perform high resolution digital\nbeamforming are significantly higher than the Nyquist rate of the signal and\nresult in considerable amount of data, that needs to be stored and processed. A\nrecently developed technique, compressed beamforming, based on the finite rate\nof innovation model, compressed sensing (CS) and Xampling ideas, allows to\nreduce the number of samples needed to reconstruct an image comprised of strong\nreflectors. A drawback of this method is its inability to treat speckle, which\nis of significant importance in medical imaging. Here we build on previous work\nand extend it to a general concept of beamforming in frequency. This allows to\nexploit the low bandwidth of the ultrasound signal and bypass the oversampling\ndictated by digital implementation of beamforming in time. Using beamforming in\nfrequency, the same image quality is obtained from far fewer samples. We next\npresent a CS-technique that allows for further rate reduction, using only a\nportion of the beamformed signal's bandwidth. We demonstrate our methods on in\nvivo cardiac data and show that reductions up to 1/28 over standard beamforming\nrates are possible.

    "abstract": "Energy consumption is an important issue in continuous wireless\ntelemonitoring of physiological signals. Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising\nframework to address it, due to its energy-efficient data compression\nprocedure. However, most CS algorithms have difficulty in data recovery due to\nnon-sparsity characteristic of many physiological signals. Block sparse\nBayesian learning (BSBL) is an effective approach to recover such signals with\nsatisfactory recovery quality. However, it is time-consuming in recovering\nmultichannel signals, since its computational load almost linearly increases\nwith the number of channels.\n  This work proposes a spatiotemporal sparse Bayesian learning algorithm to\nrecover multichannel signals simultaneously. It not only exploits temporal\ncorrelation within each channel signal, but also exploits inter-channel\ncorrelation among different channel signals. Furthermore, its computational\nload is not significantly affected by the number of channels. The proposed\nalgorithm was applied to brain computer interface (BCI) and EEG-based driver's\ndrowsiness estimation. Results showed that the algorithm had both better\nrecovery performance and much higher speed than BSBL. Particularly, the\nproposed algorithm ensured that the BCI classification and the drowsiness\nestimation had little degradation even when data were compressed by 80%, making\nit very suitable for continuous wireless telemonitoring of multichannel\nsignals.",

The aim of\nthis paper is to show that off-diagonal couplings, like cb, may lead to\nsubstantial contributions to the cross section, even if the corresponding CKM\nmatrix element is two orders of magnitude smaller. For this reason, the cross\nsection is calculated for each initial state including all diagonal and\noff-diagonal terms, and all is finally added together to get the total cross\nsection which is observed to be ~ 2.7 times larger than what is obtained from\ncs initial state.

Sparsity prior has been\nfound to be an efficient strategy in CT reconstruction where significantly\nfewer attenuation measurements are available. Sparsity prior CT reconstruction\nrelies on iterative algorithms such as the algebraic reconstruction technique\n(ART) to produce a crude reconstruction based on which a sparse approximation\nis performed. Data driven adjustment of relaxation has been found to ensure\nbetter convergence than traditional relaxation for ART. In this paper, we study\nthe performance of such data driven relaxation on a (CS) compressed sensing\nenvironment. State-of-the-art algorithms are implemented and their performance\nanalyzed in regard to conventional and data-driven relaxation. Experiments are\nperformed both on simulated and real environments.

Correlation\ncoefficients, root mean square error, structural similarity index and\nperceptual dissimilarity metric were used for the quantitative comparisons of\nthe results. Experiments reveal that data driven relaxation also ensures\noverall better quality reconstruction in a CS environment compared to\ntraditional relaxation. However, when the data are corrupted by noise,\ninconsistencies emerge in the convergence unless a threshold is imposed on the\nmaximum amendments. Data driven relaxation seems a logical choice to more\nrapidly reach the solution.

    "abstract": "Relativistic electrons, accelerated by the laser ponderomotive force, can be\nfocused onto a high-Z convertor to generate high-brightness beams of\ngamma-rays, which in turn can be used to induce photonuclear reactions. In this\nwork, the possibility of photo-transmutation of long-lived radionuclide Cs-135\nby laser-plasma driven electron source has been demonstrated through Geant4\nsimulations. High energy electron generation, bremsstrahlung and photonuclear\nreaction have been observed at four different laser intensities of 10^{20}\nW/cm^2, 5 times 10^{20} W/cm^2, 10^{21} W/cm^2 and 5 times 10^{21} W/cm^2,\nrespectively. It was shown that the laser intensity and the target geometry\nhave strong effect on the transmutation reaction yield. At different laser\nintensities the recommended target sizes were found to obtain the maximum\nreaction yield. The remarkable feature of this work is to evaluate the optimal\nlaser intensity to produce maximum reaction yield of 10^8 per Joule in laser\npulse energy, which is 10^{21} W/cm^2.

Recently, photonic time-stretch\n(PTS) technique facilitates the emergence of high-speed single-pixel cameras. A\nsignificant breakthrough in imaging speed of single-pixel cameras enables\nobservation of fast dynamic phenomena. However, according to CS theory, image\nreconstruction is an iterative process that consumes enormous amounts of\ncomputational time and cannot be performed in real time. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel single-pixel imaging technique that can produce\nhigh-quality images through rapid acquisition of their effective spatial\nFourier spectrum. We employ phase-shifting sinusoidal structured illumination\ninstead of random illumination for spectrum acquisition and apply inverse\nFourier transform to the obtained spectrum for image restoration.

A frame rate of 625 kHz and a\ncompression ratio of 10% are experimentally demonstrated in accordance with the\nrecognition rate of the QR code. An imaging flow cytometer enabling\nhigh-content screening with an unprecedented throughput of 100,000 cells/s is\nalso demonstrated.

First, by means of the Gutzwiller approximation, we obtain the phase\ndiagram of the BHM in a magnetic field.

The energy of the excess particles in\nthe bosonic FQH state is calculated using that wave function, and it is\ncompared with the energy of the vortex solid and Bose-metal. We found that the\nenergy of the bosonic FQH state is lower than that of the Bose-metal and\ncomparable with the vortex solid.

Our main results are a series of\nuniform recovery guarantees which relate the number of measurements required to\nthe basis in which the solution is sparse and certain characteristics of the\nmulti-sensor system, known as sensor profile matrices.

The salient contributions\nof this paper includes: (i) the creation of Hindi-English code-switching text\ncorpus by crawling a few blogging sites educating about the usage of the\nInternet (ii) the exploration of the parts-of-speech features towards more\neffective modeling of Hindi-English code-switched data by the monolingual\nlanguage model (LM) trained on native (Hindi) language data, and (iii) the\nproposal of a novel textual factor referred to as the code-switch factor\n(CS-factor), which allows the LM to predict the code-switching instances. In\nthe context of recognition of the code-switching data, the substantial\nreduction in the PPL is achieved with the use of POS factors and also the\nproposed CS-factor provides independent as well as additive gain in the PPL.",

    "abstract": "We report our theoretical predictions on the linear magnetoelectric (ME)\neffects originating from odd-parity multipoles associated with spontaneous spin\nand orbital ordering on a diamond structure. We derive a two-orbital model for\n$d$ electrons in $e_g$ orbitals by including the effective spin-orbit coupling\nwhich arises from the mixing between $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ orbitals. We show that\nthe model acquires a net antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling once staggered spin\nand orbital orders occur spontaneously. The staggered orders are accompanied by\nodd-parity multipoles: magnetic monopole, quadrupoles, and toroidal dipoles. We\nclassify the types of the odd-parity multipoles according to the symmetry of\nthe spin and orbital orders. Furthermore, by computing the ME tensor using the\nlinear response theory, we show that the staggered orders induce a variety of\nthe linear ME responses. We elaborate all possible ME responses for each\nstaggered order, which are useful to identify the order parameter and to detect\nthe odd-parity multipoles by measuring the ME effects. We also elucidate the\neffect of lowering symmetry by a tetragonal distortion, which leads to richer\nME responses.

    "abstract": "A novel, non-learning-based, saliency-aware, shape-cognizant correspondence\ndetermination technique is proposed for matching image pairs that are\nsignificantly disparate in nature. Images in the real world often exhibit high\ndegrees of variation in scale, orientation, viewpoint, illumination and affine\nprojection parameters, and are often accompanied by the presence of textureless\nregions and complete or partial occlusion of scene objects. The above\nconditions confound most correspondence determination techniques by rendering\nimpractical the use of global contour-based descriptors or local pixel-level\nfeatures for establishing correspondence. The proposed deep spectral\ncorrespondence (DSC) determination scheme harnesses the representational power\nof local feature descriptors to derive a complex high-level global shape\nrepresentation for matching disparate images. The proposed scheme reasons about\ncorrespondence between disparate images using high-level global shape cues\nderived from low-level local feature descriptors. Consequently, the proposed\nscheme enjoys the best of both worlds, i.e., a high degree of invariance to\naffine parameters such as scale, orientation, viewpoint, illumination afforded\nby the global shape cues and robustness to occlusion provided by the low-level\nfeature descriptors. While the shape-based component within the proposed scheme\ninfers what to look for, an additional saliency-based component dictates where\nto look at thereby tackling the noisy correspondences arising from the presence\nof textureless regions and complex backgrounds. In the proposed scheme, a joint\nimage graph is constructed using distances computed between interest points in\nthe appearance (i.e., image) space. Eigenspectral decomposition of the joint\nimage graph allows for reasoning about shape similarity to be performed\njointly, in the appearance space and eigenspace.",

    "abstract": "Compressed sensing (CS) methods in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer\nrapid acquisition and improved image quality but require iterative\nreconstruction schemes with regularization to enforce sparsity. Regardless of\nthe difficulty in obtaining a fast numerical solution, the total variation (TV)\nregularization is a preferred choice due to its edge-preserving and structure\nrecovery capabilities. While many approaches have been proposed to overcome the\nnon-differentiability of the TV cost term, an iterative shrinkage based\nformulation allows recovering an image through recursive application of linear\nfiltering and soft thresholding. However, providing an optimal setting for the\nregularization parameter is critical due to its direct impact on the rate of\nconvergence as well as steady state error. In this paper, a regularizer\nadaptively varying in the derivative space is proposed, that follows the\ngeneralized discrepancy principle (GDP). The implementation proceeds by\nadaptively reducing the discrepancy level expressed as the absolute difference\nbetween TV norms of the consistency error and the sparse approximation error. A\ncriterion based on the absolute difference between TV norms of consistency and\nsparse approximation errors is used to update the threshold. Application of the\nadaptive shrinkage TV regularizer to CS recovery of parallel MRI (pMRI) and\ntemporal gradient adaptation in dynamic MRI are shown to result in improved\nimage quality with accelerated convergence. In addition, the adaptive TV-based\niterative shrinkage (ATVIS) provides a significant speed advantage over the\nfast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA).",

These can be\ntailored at ultra-low energies, owing to the excellent experimental control\nover all relevant energy scales. First, detecting spin-exchange dynamics in the\nCs hyperfine state manifold, we resolve a series of previously unreported\nFeshbach resonances at magnetic fields below 300 mG, separated by energies as\nlow as $h\\times 15$ kHz. The series originates from a coupling to molecular\nstates with binding energies below $h\\times 1$ kHz and wave function extensions\nin the micrometer range.

This path originates from the hyperfine-analogue of dipolar\nspin-spin relaxation.

    "abstract": "This paper deals with some of the methodologies used to construct polynomial\nsurrogate models based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions for\napplications to uncertainty quantification (UQ) in aerodynamic computations. A\ncore ingredient in gPC expansions is the choice of a dedicated sampling\nstrategy, so as to define the most significant scenarios to be considered for\nthe construction of such metamodels. A desirable feature of the proposed rules\nshall be their ability to handle several random inputs simultaneously. Methods\nto identify the relative \"importance\" of those variables or uncertain data\nshall be ideally considered as well. The present work is more particularly\ndedicated to the development of sampling strategies based on sparsity\nprinciples. Sparse multi-dimensional cubature rules based on general\none-dimensional Gauss-Jacobi-type quadratures are first addressed. These sets\nare non nested, but they are well adapted to the probability density functions\nwith compact support for the random inputs considered in this study. On the\nother hand, observing that the aerodynamic quantities of interest (outputs)\ndepend only weakly on the cross-interactions between the variable inputs, it is\nargued that only low-order polynomials shall significantly contribute to their\nsurrogates. This \"sparsity-of-effects\" trend prompts the use of reconstruction\ntechniques benefiting from the sparsity of the outputs, such as compressed\nsensing (CS). CS relies on the observation that one only needs a number of\nsamples proportional to the compressed size of the outputs, rather than their\nuncompressed size, to construct reliable surrogate models.

That is puzzling, for there is no\ndetectable static distortion, and because the features and splittings disappear\nupon modest heating, which they should not.

This demonstrates the importance of a fully quantum\ntreatment of nuclear positions and orbital momenta in the Mott insulator sites,\ndynamically but not statically distorted. The observed demise of these features\nwith temperature is explained by the thermal population of a multiplet term\nwhose nuclear positions are essentially undistorted, but whose energy is very\nlow-lying. That term is in facts a scaled-down orbital excitation analogous to\nthat of other Mott insulators, with the same spin $1/2$ as the ground state,\nbut with a larger orbital moment of two instead of one.",

In reality,\nhowever, many problems are coherent, and conventional methods such as $L_1$\nminimization do not work well. Recently, the difference of the $L_1$ and $L_2$\nnorms, denoted as $L_1$-$L_2$, is shown to have superior performance over the\nclassic $L_1$ method, but it is computationally expensive. We derive an\nanalytical solution for the proximal operator of the $L_1$-$L_2$ metric, and it\nmakes some fast $L_1$ solvers such as forward-backward splitting (FBS) and\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) applicable for $L_1$-$L_2$.\nWe describe in details how to incorporate the proximal operator into FBS and\nADMM and show that the resulting algorithms are convergent under mild\nconditions.

However, the computational costs are usually expensive. This paper\naims to propose a computationally fast and accurate deep learning algorithm for\nthe reconstruction of MR images from highly down-sampled k-space data.\n  Theory: Based on the topological analysis, we show that the data manifold of\nthe aliasing artifact is easier to learn from a uniform subsampling pattern\nwith additional low-frequency k-space data. Thus, we develop deep aliasing\nartifact learning networks for the magnitude and phase images to estimate and\nremove the aliasing artifacts from highly accelerated MR acquisition.\n  Methods: The aliasing artifacts are directly estimated from the distorted\nmagnitude and phase images reconstructed from subsampled k-space data so that\nwe can get an aliasing-free images by subtracting the estimated aliasing\nartifact from corrupted inputs. Moreover, to deal with the globally distributed\naliasing artifact, we develop a multi-scale deep neural network with a large\nreceptive field.\n  Results: The experimental results confirm that the proposed deep artifact\nlearning network effectively estimates and removes the aliasing artifacts.\nCompared to existing CS methods from single and multi-coli data, the proposed\nnetwork shows minimal errors by removing the coherent aliasing artifacts.\nFurthermore, the computational time is by order of magnitude faster.\n  Conclusion: As the proposed deep artifact learning network immediately\ngenerates accurate reconstruction, it has great potential for clinical\napplications.",

    "abstract": "The scaled particle theory (SPT) approximation is applied for the study of\nthe influence of a porous medium on the isotropic-nematic transition in a hard\nspherocylinder fluid. Two new approaches are developed in order to improve the\ndescription in the case of small lengths of spherocylinders. In one of them,\nthe so-called SPT-CS-PL approach, the Carnahan-Starling (CS) correction is\nintroduced to improve the description of thermodynamic properties of the fluid,\nwhile the Parsons-Lee (PL) correction is introduced to improve the\norientational ordering. The second approach, the so-called SPT-PL approach, is\nconnected with generalization of the PL theory to anisotropic fluids in\ndisordered porous media. The phase diagram is obtained from the bifurcation\nanalysis of a nonlinear integral equation for the singlet distribution function\nand from the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. The results obtained are\ncompared with computer simulation data. Both ways and both approaches\nconsiderably improve the description in the case of spherocylinder fluids with\nsmaller spherocylinder lengths. We did not find any significant differences\nbetween the results of the two developed approaches. We found that the\nbifurcation analysis slightly overestimates and the thermodynamical analysis\nunderestimates the predictions of the computer simulation data. A porous medium\nshifts the phase diagram to smaller densities of the fluid and does not change\nthe type of the transition.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated magnetic resonance (MR) scan acquisition with compressed sensing\n(CS) and parallel imaging is a powerful method to reduce MR imaging scan time.\nHowever, many reconstruction algorithms have high computational costs. To\naddress this, we investigate deep residual learning networks to remove aliasing\nartifacts from artifact corrupted images. The proposed deep residual learning\nnetworks are composed of magnitude and phase networks that are separately\ntrained. If both phase and magnitude information are available, the proposed\nalgorithm can work as an iterative k-space interpolation algorithm using\nframelet representation. When only magnitude data is available, the proposed\napproach works as an image domain post-processing algorithm. Even with strong\ncoherent aliasing artifacts, the proposed network successfully learned and\nremoved the aliasing artifacts, whereas current parallel and CS reconstruction\nmethods were unable to remove these artifacts. Comparisons using single and\nmultiple coil show that the proposed residual network provides good\nreconstruction results with orders of magnitude faster computational time than\nexisting compressed sensing methods. The proposed deep learning framework may\nhave a great potential for accelerated MR reconstruction by generating accurate\nresults immediately.",

    "abstract": "The problem of excessive pilot overhead required for uplink massive MIMO\nchannel estimation is well known, let alone when it is considered along with\nwideband (OFDM) transmissions. Towards channel estimators that are both\nefficient and require low-training overhead, compressive sensing (CS)\napproaches have been increasingly popular, exploiting the sparse nature of the\nphysical channel. However, no analytical insights regarding the overhead\nrequired for reliable channel estimation in wideband massive MIMO are\navailable. By observing that the wideband massive MIMO channel can be\nrepresented by a vector that is not simply sparse but has well defined\nstructural properties, referred to as hierarchical sparsity, we propose low\ncomplexity channel estimators for the multiuser scenario that take this\nproperty into account. By employing the framework of the hierarchical\nrestricted isometry property, rigorous performance guarantees for these\nalgorithms are provided suggesting concrete design goals for the user pilot\nsequences. For a specific design, we analytically characterize the scaling of\nthe required pilot overhead with increasing number of antennas and bandwidth,\nrevealing that, as long as the number of antennas is sufficiently large, it is\nindependent of the per user channel sparsity level as well as the number of\nactive users. Hence, surprisingly, in contrast to the classical setting, pilot\noverhead can be shifted into spatial dimensions not affecting crucial bandwidth\nconstraints thereby increasing the overall system capacity. These analytical\ninsights are verified by simulation results demonstrating also the superiority\nof the proposed algorithm over conventional CS algorithms that ignore the\nhierarchical sparsity property.",

Hence, such inherent error\ntolerance in the bio-signals can be exploited to achieve high energy savings\nthrough the emerging trends like, the Approximate Computing which is applicable\nat both software and hardware levels. In this paper, we propose to leverage the\napproximate computing in digital Compressed Sensing (CS), through low-power\napproximate adders (LPAA) in an accurate Bernoulli sensing-based CS acquisition\n(BCS). We demonstrate that approximations can indeed be safely employed in IoT\nhealthcare without affecting the detection of critical events in the biomedical\nsignals. Towards this, we explored the trade-of between energy efficiency and\noutput quality using the state-of-the-art lp2d RLS reconstruction algorithm.\nThe proposed framework is validated with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. Our\nresults demonstrated approximately 59% energy savings as compared to the\naccurate design.",

    "abstract": "An end-to-end trainable ConvNet architecture, that learns to harness the\npower of shape representation for matching disparate image pairs, is proposed.\nDisparate image pairs are deemed those that exhibit strong affine variations in\nscale, viewpoint and projection parameters accompanied by the presence of\npartial or complete occlusion of objects and extreme variations in ambient\nillumination. Under these challenging conditions, neither local nor global\nfeature-based image matching methods, when used in isolation, have been\nobserved to be effective. The proposed correspondence determination scheme for\nmatching disparate images exploits high-level shape cues that are derived from\nlow-level local feature descriptors, thus combining the best of both worlds. A\ngraph-based representation for the disparate image pair is generated by\nconstructing an affinity matrix that embeds the distances between feature\npoints in two images, thus modeling the correspondence determination problem as\none of graph matching. The eigenspectrum of the affinity matrix, i.e., the\nlearned global shape representation, is then used to further regress the\ntransformation or homography that defines the correspondence between the source\nimage and target image. The proposed scheme is shown to yield state-of-the-art\nresults for both, coarse-level shape matching as well as fine point-wise\ncorrespondence determination.",

Super-resolution techniques can\nobtain high-resolution MRI images. The traditional methods obtained the\nresolution enhancement of brain MRI by interpolations, affecting the accuracy\nof the following diagnose process. The requirement for brain image quality is\nfast increasing. In this paper, we propose an image super-resolution (SR)\nmethod based on overcomplete dictionaries and inherent similarity of an image\nto recover the high-resolution (HR) image from a single low-resolution (LR)\nimage. We explore the nonlocal similarity of the image to tentatively search\nfor similar blocks in the whole image and present a joint reconstruction method\nbased on compressive sensing (CS) and similarity constraints. The sparsity and\nself-similarity of the image blocks are taken as the constraints. The proposed\nmethod is summarized in the following steps. First, a dictionary classification\nmethod based on the measurement domain is presented. The image blocks are\nclassified into smooth, texture and edge parts by analyzing their features in\nthe measurement domain. Then, the corresponding dictionaries are trained using\nthe classified image blocks. Equally important, in the reconstruction part, we\nuse the CS reconstruction method to recover the HR brain MRI image, considering\nboth nonlocal similarity and the sparsity of an image as the constraints.

Furthermore, numerous micro-metastasis leads to the wide\nspread of the tumor cells across the body which is the beginning of metastasis.\nThe epigenetic processes (DNA methylation or histone remodification etc.) can\nprovide a source for certain heterogeneity. In this study, we develop a\nmathematical model to quantify the heterogeneity of SC, CSC and cancer taking\nboth genetic and epigenetic effects into consideration. We uncovered the roles\nand physical mechanisms of heterogeneity from the three aspects (SC, CSC and\ncancer). In the adiabatic regime (relatively fast regulatory binding and\neffective coupling among genes), seven native states (SC, CSC, Cancer,\nPremalignant, Normal, Lesion and Hyperplasia) emerge. In non-adiabatic regime\n(relatively slow regulatory binding and effective weak coupling among genes),\nmultiple meta-stable SC, CS, CSC and differentiated states emerged which can\nexplain the origin of heterogeneity. In other words, the slow regulatory\nbinding mimicking the epigenetics can give rise to heterogeneity.

Here, we develop an EFDR procedure for\npossibly incomplete data defined on irregular small areas. Motivated by\nstatistical learning, we use conditional simulation (CS) to condition on the\navailable data and simulate the full rectangular image at its finest resolution\nmany times (M, say).

    "title": "Serial Quantization for Sparse Time Sequences",
    "abstract": "Sparse signals are encountered in a broad range of applications. In order to\nprocess these signals using digital hardware, they must be first sampled and\nquantized using an analog-to-digital convertor (ADC), which typically operates\nin a serial scalar manner. In this work, we propose a method for serial\nquantization of sparse time sequences (SQuaTS) inspired by group testing\ntheory, which is designed to reliably and accurately quantize sparse signals\nacquired in a sequential manner using serial scalar ADCs. Unlike previously\nproposed approaches which combine quantization and compressed sensing (CS), our\nSQuaTS scheme updates its representation on each incoming analog sample and\ndoes not require the complete signal to be observed and stored in analog prior\nto quantization. We characterize the asymptotic tradeoff between accuracy and\nquantization rate of SQuaTS as well as its computational burden. We also\npropose a variation of SQuaTS, which trades rate for computational efficiency.\nNext, we show how SQuaTS can be naturally extended to distributed quantization\nscenarios, where a set of jointly sparse time sequences are acquired\nindividually and processed jointly. Our numerical results demonstrate that\nSQuaTS is capable of achieving substantially improved representation accuracy\nover previous CS-based schemes without requiring the complete set of analog\nsignal samples to be observed prior to its quantization, making it an\nattractive approach for acquiring sparse time sequences.",

    "abstract": "We report a detailed semi-analytical treatment to investigate the dynamics of\na single cavity soliton (CS) and two co-propagating CSs separately in a Kerr\nmediated passive optical fiber resonator which is driven by a phase-modulated\npump. The perturbation is dealt with by introducing a Rayleigh's dissipation\nfunction in the framework of variational principle that results in a set of\ncoupled ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of individual\nsoliton parameters. We further derive closed-form expressions for quick\nestimation of the temporal trajectory, drift velocity and the phase shift\naccumulated by the CS due to the externally modulated pump. We also extend the\nvariational approach to solve two solitons interaction problem in the absence\nas well as in the presence of the externally modulated field. In absence of\nphase modulated field, the two copropagating solitons can attract, repulse or\ncan propagate independently depending on their initial delay. The final state\nof interaction can be predicted through a second-order differential equation\nwhich is derived by the variational method. While in presence of the phase\nmodulated field, the two solitons interaction can result in annihilation,\nmerging, breathing or two soliton state depending on the detuning frequency and\nthe pump power. Variational treatment analytically predicts these states and\nportrays the related dynamics that agrees with full numerical simulation\ncarried out by solving the normalized Lugiato-Lefever equation.

However, these algorithms are faced with the\ntradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. The fast algorithms are generally\nless accurate, while the accurate dose engines are often time consuming. In\nthis work, we try to resolve this dilemma by exploring deep learning (DL) for\ndose calculation. Methods: We developed a new radiotherapy dose calculation\nengine based on a modified Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net (HD U-net)\nmodel and tested its feasibility with prostate intensity-modulated radiation\ntherapy (IMRT) cases. Mapping from an IMRT fluence map domain to a 3D dose\ndomain requires a deep neural network of complicated architecture and a huge\ntraining dataset. To solve this problem, we first project the fluence maps to\nthe dose domain using a modified ray-tracing algorithm, and then we use the HD\nU-net to map the ray-tracing dose distribution into an accurate dose\ndistribution calculated using a collapsed cone convolution/superposition (CS)\nalgorithm. Results: It takes about one second to compute a 3D dose distribution\nfor a typical 7-field prostate IMRT plan, which can be further reduced to\nachieve real-time dose calculation by optimizing the network. For all eight\ntesting patients, evaluation with Gamma Index and various clinical goals for\nIMRT optimization shows that the DL dose distributions are clinically identical\nto the CS dose distributions.

Several experiments are conducted to thoroughly assess the\nperformance of the proposed DTKC model. The results indicate that the model\noutperforms, or performs comparable to, a wide range of baseline algorithms.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the broadband channel estimation (CE) for intelligent\nreflecting surface (IRS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems.\nThe CE for such systems is a challenging task due to the large dimension of\nboth the active massive MIMO at the base station (BS) and passive IRS. To\naddress this problem, this paper proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CE\nsolution for IRS-aided mmWave massive MIMO systems, whereby the angular channel\nsparsity of large-scale array at mmWave is exploited for improved CE with\nreduced pilot overhead. Specifically, we first propose a downlink pilot\ntransmission framework. By designing the pilot signals based on the prior\nknowledge that the line-of-sight dominated BS-to-IRS channel is known, the\nhigh-dimensional channels for BS-to-user and IRS-to-user can be jointly\nestimated based on CS theory. Moreover, to efficiently estimate broadband\nchannels, a distributed orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is exploited,\nwhere the common sparsity shared by the channels at different subcarriers is\nutilized. Additionally, the redundant dictionary to combat the power leakage is\nalso designed for the enhanced CE performance. Simulation results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Internet of underwater things (IoUT) is a technological revolution that could\nmark a new era for scientific, industrial, and military underwater\napplications. To mitigate the hostile underwater channel characteristics, this\npaper hybridizes underwater acoustic and optical wireless communications to\nachieve a ubiquitous control and high-speed low-latency networking performance,\nrespectively. Since underwater optical wireless communications (UOWC) suffers\nfrom limited range, it requires effective multi-hop routing solutions. In this\nregard, we propose a Sector-based Opportunistic Routing (SectOR) protocol.\nUnlike the traditional routing (TR) techniques which unicast packets to a\nunique relay, opportunistic routing (OR) targets a set of candidate relays by\nleveraging the broadcast nature of the UOWC channel. OR improves the packet\ndelivery ratio as the likelihood of having at least one successful packet\nreception is much higher than that in conventional unicast routing. Contingent\nupon the performance characterization of a single-hop link, we obtain a variety\nof local and global metrics to evaluate the fitness of a candidate set (CS) and\nprioritize the members of a CS. Since rate-error and range-beamwidth tradeoffs\nyield different candidate set diversities, we develop a candidate filtering and\nsearching algorithm to find the optimal sector-shaped coverage region by\nscanning the feasible search space. Moreover, a hybrid acoustic/optic\ncoordination mechanism is considered to avoid duplicate transmission of the\nrelays. Numerical results show that SectOR protocol can perform even better\nthan an optimal unicast routing protocol in well-connected UOWNs.",

    "abstract": "Deep-learning-based methods for different applications have been shown\nvulnerable to adversarial examples. These examples make deployment of such\nmodels in safety-critical tasks questionable. Use of deep neural networks as\ninverse problem solvers has generated much excitement for medical imaging\nincluding CT and MRI, but recently a similar vulnerability has also been\ndemonstrated for these tasks. We show that for such inverse problem solvers,\none should analyze and study the effect of adversaries in the\nmeasurement-space, instead of the signal-space as in previous work. In this\npaper, we propose to modify the training strategy of end-to-end\ndeep-learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness. We introduce\nan auxiliary network to generate adversarial examples, which is used in a\nmin-max formulation to build robust image reconstruction networks.\nTheoretically, we show for a linear reconstruction scheme the min-max\nformulation results in a singular-value(s) filter regularized solution, which\nsuppresses the effect of adversarial examples occurring because of\nill-conditioning in the measurement matrix. We find that a linear network using\nthe proposed min-max learning scheme indeed converges to the same solution. In\naddition, for non-linear Compressed Sensing (CS) reconstruction using deep\nnetworks, we show significant improvement in robustness using the proposed\napproach over other methods. We complement the theory by experiments for CS on\ntwo different datasets and evaluate the effect of increasing perturbations on\ntrained networks.

    "abstract": "To avoid decorrelation, conventional synthetic aperture radar interferometry\n(InSAR) requires that interferometric images should have a common spectral band\nand the same resolution after proper preprocessing. For a high-resolution (HR)\nimage and a low-resolution (LR) one, the interferogram quality is limited by\nthe LR one since the non-common band (NCB) between two images is usually\ndiscarded. In this article, we try to establish an InSAR method to improve\ninterferogram quality by means of exploiting the NCB. To this end, we first\ndefine a new interferogram, which has the same resolution as the HR image. Then\nwe formulate the interferometric relationship between the two images into a\ncompressive sensing (CS) model, which contains the proposed HR interferogram.\nWith the sparsity of interferogram in appropriate domains, we model the\ninterferogram formation as a typical sparse recovery problem. Due to the\nspeckle effect in coherent radar imaging, the sensing matrix of our CS model is\ninherently random. We theoretically prove that the sensing matrix satisfies\nrestricted isometry property, and thus the interferogram recovery performance\nis guaranteed. Furthermore, we provide a fast interferogram formation algorithm\nby exploiting computationally efficient structures of the sensing matrix.\nNumerical experiments show that the proposed method provides better\ninterferogram quality in the sense of reduced phase noise and obtain\nextrapolated interferogram spectra with respect to CB processing.",

They contain AFM\nordered Mn layers, while the interlayer coupling changes from ferromagnetic\n(FM) for KMnBi to AFM for RbMnBi and CsMnBi. We find that these materials are\nnarrow gap semiconductors. Owing to the small effective mass, the electron\ncarrier mobility can be very high, reaching up to 100,000 cm2/(Vs) for KMnBi.\nIn contrast, the hole mobility is much suppressed, typically lower by two\norders of magnitude. We further study their two-dimensional (2D) single layer\nstructures, which are found be AFM with fairly high mobility (1000 cm2/(Vs)).\nTheir Neel temperatures can still reach room temperature. Interesting, we find\nthat the magnetic phase transition is also accompanied by a metal-insulator\nphase transition, with the paramagnetic metal phase possessing a pair of\nnonsymmorphic-symmetry-protected 2D spin-orbit Dirac points.

One of the problems in CS approaches is determining\nthe regularization parameters, which control the balance between data fidelity\nthe spatial and temporal regularization terms.

Finally, we demonstrate that the average surface recombination\nvelocity (SRV) decreases from ~1000 cm/s to ~10 cm/s post APTMS passivation for\nFA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3. Our results demonstrate that surface-mediated\nrecombination is the primary non-radiative loss pathway in MA-free mixed-cation\nmixed-halide films with a range of different bandgaps, which is a problem\nobserved for a wide range of perovskite active layers and reactive electrical\ncontacts. This study indicates that surface passivation and contact engineering\nwill enable near-theoretical device efficiencies with these materials.",

In this\npaper, we propose and compare, two neural networks based on the convolutional\nlong short-term memory unit, namely ConvLSTM, with differences in the\narchitecture and the long-term learning strategy. The former uses a\nvideo-length adaptive input data generator (\\emph{stateless}) whereas the\nlatter explores the \\emph{stateful} ability of general recurrent neural\nnetworks but applied in the particular case of HAR. This stateful property\nallows the model to accumulate discriminative patterns from previous frames\nwithout compromising computer memory. Experimental results on the large-scale\nNTU RGB+D dataset show that the proposed models achieve competitive recognition\naccuracies with lower computational cost compared with state-of-the-art methods\nand prove that, in the particular case of videos, the rarely-used stateful mode\nof recurrent neural networks significantly improves the accuracy obtained with\nthe standard mode.

    "abstract": "Hungarian is often referred to as a discourse-configurational language, since\nthe structural position of constituents is determined by their logical function\n(topic or comment) rather than their grammatical function (e.g., subject or\nobject). We build on work by Koml\\'osy (1989) and argue that in addition to\ndiscourse context, the lexical semantics of the verb also plays a significant\nrole in determining Hungarian word order. In order to investigate the role of\nlexical semantics in determining Hungarian word order, we conduct a\nlarge-scale, data-driven analysis on the ordering of 380 transitive verbs and\ntheir objects, as observed in hundreds of thousands of examples extracted from\nthe Hungarian Gigaword Corpus. We test the effect of lexical semantics on the\nordering of verbs and their objects by grouping verbs into 11 semantic classes.\nIn addition to the semantic class of the verb, we also include two control\nfeatures related to information structure, object definiteness and object NP\nweight, chosen to allow a comparison of their effect size to that of verb\nsemantics. Our results suggest that all three features have a significant\neffect on verb-object ordering in Hungarian and among these features, the\nsemantic class of the verb has the largest effect. Specifically, we find that\nstative verbs, such as fed \"cover\", jelent \"mean\" and \\\"ovez \"surround\", tend\nto be OV-preferring (with the exception of psych verbs which are strongly\nVO-preferring) and non-stative verbs, such as b\\'ir\\'al \"judge\", cs\\\"okkent\n\"reduce\" and cs\\'okol \"kiss\", verbs tend to be VO-preferring.

    "abstract": "We have imaged 15 molecular-line emissions and the dust continuum emission\naround the Class 0 protostellar source, IRAS 15398-3359, with ALMA. The outflow\nstructure is mainly traced by the H2CO (K_a=0 and 1), CCH, and CS emissions.\nThese lines also trace the disk/envelope structure around the protostar. The\nH2CO (K_a=2 and 3), CH3OH, and SO emissions are concentrated toward the\nprotostar, while the DCN emission is more extended around the protostar. We\nhave performed the principal component analysis (PCA) for these distributions\non the two different scales, the outflow and the disk/envelope structure. For\nthe latter case, the molecular-line distributions are classified into two\ngroups, according to the contribution of the second principal component, one\nhaving a compact distribution around the protostar and the other showing a\nrather extended distribution over the envelope. Moreover, the second principal\ncomponent value tends to increase as an increasing quantum number of H2CO\n(K_a=0,1,2, and 3), reflecting the excitation condition: the distribution is\nmore compact for higher excitation lines. These results indicate that PCA is\neffective to extract the characteristic feature of the molecular line\ndistributions around the protostar in an unbiased way. In addition, we identify\nfour blobs in the outflow structure in the H2CO lines, some of which can also\nbe seen in the CH3OH, CS, CCH, and SO emissions. The gas temperature derived\nfrom the H2CO lines ranges from 43 to 63 K, which suggests shocks due to the\nlocal impact of the outflow on clumps of the ambient gas.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR)-$T_2^*$ mapping is widely used to study hemorrhage,\ncalcification and iron deposition in various clinical applications, it provides\na direct and precise mapping of desired contrast in the tissue. However, the\nlong acquisition time required by conventional 3D high-resolution $T_2^*$\nmapping method causes discomfort to patients and introduces motion artifacts to\nreconstructed images, which limits its wider applicability. In this paper we\naddress this issue by performing $T_2^*$ mapping from undersampled data using\ncompressive sensing (CS). We formulate the reconstruction as a nonconvex\nproblem that can be decomposed into two subproblems. They can be solved either\nseparately via the standard approach or jointly via the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM). Compared to previous CS-based approaches that\nonly apply sparse regularization on the spin density $\\boldsymbol X_0$ and the\nrelaxation rate $\\boldsymbol R_2^*$, our formulation enforces additional sparse\npriors on the $T_2^*$-weighted images at multiple echoes to improve the\nreconstruction performance. We performed convergence analysis of the proposed\nalgorithm, evaluated its performance on in vivo data, and studied the effects\nof different sampling schemes. Experimental results showed that the proposed\njoint-recovery approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art method,\nespecially in the low-sampling rate regime, making it a preferred choice to\nperform fast 3D $T_2^*$ mapping in practice.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has long been considered to be among the\ngold standards of today's diagnostic imaging. The most significant drawback of\nMRI is long acquisition times, prohibiting its use in standard practice for\nsome applications. Compressed sensing (CS) proposes to subsample the k-space\n(the Fourier domain dual to the physical space of spatial coordinates) leading\nto significantly accelerated acquisition. However, the benefit of compressed\nsensing has not been fully exploited; most of the sampling densities obtained\nthrough CS do not produce a trajectory that obeys the stringent constraints of\nthe MRI machine imposed in practice. Inspired by recent success of deep\nlearning based approaches for image reconstruction and ideas from computational\nimaging on learning-based design of imaging systems, we introduce 3D FLAT, a\nnovel protocol for data-driven design of 3D non-Cartesian accelerated\ntrajectories in MRI. Our proposal leverages the entire 3D k-space to\nsimultaneously learn a physically feasible acquisition trajectory with a\nreconstruction method. Experimental results, performed as a proof-of-concept,\nsuggest that 3D FLAT achieves higher image quality for a given readout time\ncompared to standard trajectories such as radial, stack-of-stars, or 2D learned\ntrajectories (trajectories that evolve only in the 2D plane while fully\nsampling along the third dimension).

According to this scenario, we propose a secure\nand efficient charging scheduling system based on DAG-blockchain and double\nauction mechanism. In a smart area, it attempts to assign EVs to the available\nCSs in the light of their submitted charging requests and status information.\nFirst, we design a lightweight charging scheduling framework that integrates\nDAG-blockchain and modern cryptography technology to ensure security and\nscalability during performing scheduling and completing tradings. In this\nprocess, a constrained double auction problem is formulated because of the\nlimited charging resources in a CS, which motivates the EVs and CSs in this\narea to participate in the market based on their preferences and statuses. Due\nto this constraint, our problem is more complicated and harder to achieve the\ntruthfulness as well as system efficiency compared to the existing double\nauction model. To adapt to it, we propose two algorithms, namely the truthful\nmechanism for charging (TMC) and efficient mechanism for charging (EMC), to\ndetermine the assignments between EVs and CSs and pricing strategies.

However, the robustness of\noptical lattice clocks has not yet reached a level comparable to that of Cs\nfountain clocks which contribute to International Atomic Time (TAI) by the\nnearly continuous operation. In this paper, we report the long-term operation\nof an $^{171}$Yb optical lattice clock with a coverage of 80.3% for half a year\nincluding uptimes of 93.9% for the first 24 days and 92.6% for the last 35\ndays. This enables a nearly dead-time-free frequency comparison of the optical\nlattice clock with TAI over months, which provides a link to the SI second with\nan uncertainty of low $10^{-16}$. By using this link, the absolute frequency of\nthe $^{1}$S$_{0}-^{3}$P$_{0}$ clock transition of $^{171}$Yb is measured as 518\n295 836 590 863.54(26) Hz with a fractional uncertainty of $5.0\\times10^{-16}$.\nThis value is in agreement with the recommended frequency of $^{171}$Yb as a\nsecondary representation of the second.",

    "abstract": "We report ALMA observations of CO(3-2) emission in the Seyfert2/starburst\ngalaxy NGC1808, at a spatial resolution of 4pc. Our aim is to investigate the\nmorphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central 0.5kpc, and to probe\nnuclear feeding and feedback phenomena. We discovered a nuclear spiral of\nradius 1\"=45pc and inside it a decoupled circumnuclear disk, or molecular torus\nof radius 0.13\"=6pc. The HCN(4-3) and HCO$\\rm^+$(4-3) and CS(7-6) dense gas\nline tracers were simultaneously mapped and detected in the nuclear spiral and\npresent the same misalignment in the molecular torus. At the nucleus the\nHCN/HCO$^+$ and HCN/CS ratios indicate the presence of an AGN. The molecular\ngas shows regular rotation, within a radius of 400pc, except for the misaligned\ndisk inside the nuclear spiral arms. The computations of the torques exerted on\nthe gas by the barred stellar potential reveal that the gas within a radius of\n50pc is feeding the nucleus, on a time-scale of $\\sim$60Myr. Some non-circular\nmotions are observed towards the center, corresponding to the nuclear spiral\narms. We cannot rule out that small extra kinematic perturbations could be\ninterpreted as a weak outflow due to the AGN feedback.

    "abstract": "Recent observations have revealed that most proto-planetary discs show a\npattern of bright rings and dark gaps. However, most of the high-resolution\nobservations have focused only on the continuum emission. In this Paper we\npresent high-resolution ALMA band 7 (0.89mm) observations of the disc around\nthe star CI Tau in the $^{12}$CO & $^{13}$CO $J=3$-2 and CS $J=7$-6 emission\nlines. Our recent work demonstrated that the disc around CI Tau contains three\ngaps and rings in continuum emission, and we look for their counterparts in the\ngas emission. While we find no counterpart of the third gap and ring in\n$^{13}$CO, the disc has a gap in emission at the location of the second\ncontinuum ring (rather than gap). We demonstrate that this is mostly an\nartefact of the continuum subtraction, although a residual gap still remains\nafter accounting for this effect. Through radiative transfer modelling we\npropose this is due to the inner disc shadowing the outer parts of the disc and\nmaking them colder. This raises a note of caution in mapping high-resolution\ngas emission lines observations to the gas surface density - while possible,\nthis needs to be done carefully. In contrast to $^{13}$CO, CS emission shows\ninstead a ring morphology, most likely due to chemical effects. Finally, we\nnote that $^{12}$CO is heavily absorbed by the foreground preventing any\nmorphological study using this line.",

With fixed layouts of roadside buildings and regular vehicular moving\ntrajectory, the dominant path directions of channels will likely be among a\nsubset of beam directions instead of distributing randomly over the whole\nbeamspace. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based technique to design\na structured compressed sensing (CS) matrix that is well suited to the\nunderlying channel distribution for mmWave vehicular beam alignment. The\nproposed approach leverages both sparsity and the particular spatial structure\nthat appears in vehicular channels.

Specifically for binary linear classification of a\nseparable dataset, we show that the modified loss converges to the max-margin\nSVM classifier despite the logit adjustment.

Compressive sensing (CS)-based RA schemes scale up the RRs at the\nexpense of increased non-orthogonality among transmitted signals. This paper\npresents the design of multi-sequence spreading random access (MSRA) which\nemploys multiple spreading sequences to spread the different symbols of a user\nas opposed to the conventional schemes in which a user employs the same\nspreading sequence for each symbol. We show that MSRA provides code diversity,\nenabling the multi-user detection (MUD) to be modeled into a well-conditioned\nmultiple measurement vector (MMV) CS problem. The code diversity is quantified\nby the decrease in the average Babel mutual coherence among the spreading\nsequences. Moreover, we present a two-stage active user detection (AUD) scheme\nfor both wideband and narrowband implementation.

The\naccuracy of reconstructions from the different undersampled datasets was\nassessed using the vessel-masked structural similarity index.

    "title": "Cross-Subject Domain Adaptation for Multi-Frame EEG Images",
    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is a basic part of human cognition, which plays an\nimportant role in the study of human cognitive load. Among various brain\nimaging techniques, electroencephalography has shown its advantage on easy\naccess and reliability. However, one of the critical challenges is that\nindividual difference may cause the ineffective results, especially when the\nestablished model meets an unfamiliar subject. In this work, we propose a\ncross-subject deep adaptation model with spatial attention (CS-DASA) to\ngeneralize the workload classifications across subjects. First, we transform\ntime-series EEG data into multi-frame EEG images incorporating more\nspatio-temporal information. First, the subject-shared module in CS-DASA\nreceives multi-frame EEG image data from both source and target subjects and\nlearns the common feature representations. Then, in subject-specific module,\nthe maximum mean discrepancy is implemented to measure the domain distribution\ndivergence in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which can add an effective\npenalty loss for domain adaptation. Additionally, the subject-to-subject\nspatial attention mechanism is employed to focus on the most discriminative\nspatial feature in EEG image data. Experiments conducted on a public WM EEG\ndataset containing 13 subjects show that the proposed model is capable of\nachieve better performance than existing state-of-the art methods.",

    "abstract": "Compressed Sensing (CS) theory simultaneously realizes the signal sampling\nand compression process, and can use fewer observations to achieve accurate\nsignal recovery, providing a solution for better and faster transmission of\nmassive data. In this paper, a ternary sampling matrix-based method with\nattention mechanism is proposed with the purpose to solve the problem that the\nCS sampling matrices in most cases are random matrices, which are irrelative to\nthe sampled signal and need a large storage space. The proposed method consists\nof three components, i.e., ternary sampling, initial reconstruction and deep\nreconstruction, with the emphasis on the ternary sampling. The main idea of the\nternary method (-1, 0, +1) is to introduce the attention mechanism to evaluate\nthe importance of parameters at the sampling layer after the sampling matrix is\nbinarized (-1, +1), followed by pruning weight of parameters, whose importance\nis below a predefined threshold, to achieve ternarization. Furthermore, a\ncompressed sensing algorithm especially for image reconstruction is\nimplemented, on the basis of the ternary sampling matrix, which is called\nATP-Net, i.e., Attention-based ternary projection network. Experimental results\nshow that the quality of image reconstruction by means of ATP-Net maintains a\nsatisfactory level with the employment of the ternary sampling matrix, i.e.,\nthe average PSNR on Set11 is 30.4 when the sampling rate is 0.25, approximately\n6% improvement compared with that of DR2-Net.",

    "abstract": "We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the\nfaint transient SN 2008S discovered in NGC 6946. SN 2008S exhibited slow\nphotometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first nine\nmonths, implying a high density CS medium. The light curve is similar in shape\nto that of SN 1998S and SN 1979C, although significantly fainter at maximum\nlight. Our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tail\nphase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}Co. We propose that this is\nevidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}Ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 M_Sun).\nThe large MIR flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a light\necho from pre-exisiting dust. The late NIR flux excess is plausibly due to a\ncombination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust in\nthe CS environment. We reassess the progenitor object detected previously in\nSpitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the MIR\nspectral energy distribution. This supports the idea of a dusty, optically\nthick shell around SN 2008S with an inner radius of nearly 90AU and outer\nradius of 450AU, and an inferred heating source of 3000 K and luminosity of L ~\n10^{4.6} L_Sun. The combination of our monitoring data and the evidence from\nthe progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electron\ncapture supernova explosion in a super-AGB progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8\nM_sun) embedded within a thick CS gaseous envelope. We suggest that all of main\nproperties of the electron capture SN phenomenon are observed in SN 2008S and\nfuture observations may allow a definitive answer.",

    "abstract": "The SOLIS (Seeds Of Life In Space) IRAM/NOEMA Large Program aims at studying\na set of crucial complex organic molecules in a sample of sources, with\nwell-known physical structure, covering the various phases of Solar-type star\nformation. One representative object of the transition from the prestellar core\nto the protostar phases has been observed toward the Very Low Luminosity Object\n(VeLLO) called L1521F. This type of source is important to study to make the\nlink between prestellar cores and Class 0 sources and also to constrain the\nchemical evolution during the process of star formation. Two frequency windows\n(81.6-82.6 GHz and 96.65-97.65 GHz) were used to observe the emission from\nseveral complex organics toward the L1521F VeLLO. Only 2 transitions of\nmethanol (A+, E2) have been detected in the narrow window centered at 96.7 GHz\n(with an upper limit on E1) in a very compact emission blob (~7'' corresponding\nto ~1000au) toward the NE of the L1521F protostar. The CS 2-1 transition is\nalso detected within the WideX bandwidth. Consistently, with what has been\nfound in prestellar cores, the methanol emission appears ~1000au away from the\ndust peak. The location of the methanol blob coincides with one of the\nfilaments previously reported in the literature. The Tex of the gas inferred\nfrom methanol is (10$\\pm$2) K, while the H2 gas density (estimated from the\ndetected CS 2-1 emission and previous CS 5-4 ALMA obs.) is a factor >25 higher\nthan the density in the surrounding environment (n(H2) >10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$).\nFrom its compactness, low excitation temperature and high gas density, we\nsuggest that the methanol emission detected with NOEMA is either a cold and\ndense shock-induced blob, recently formed ($\\leq$ few hundred years) by\ninfalling gas or a cold and dense fragment that may have just been formed as a\nresult of the intense gas dynamics found within the L1521F VeLLO system.",

    "abstract": "Sulphur is one of the most abundant elements in the Universe. Surprisingly,\nsulphuretted molecules are not as abundant as expected in the interstellar\nmedium, and the identity of the main sulphur reservoir is still an open\nquestion. Our goal is to investigate the H$_{2}$S chemistry in dark clouds, as\nthis stable molecule is a potential sulphur reservoir. Using millimeter\nobservations of CS, SO, H$_{2}$S, and their isotopologues, we determine the\nphysical conditions and H$_{2}$S abundances along the cores TMC 1-C, TMC 1-CP,\nand Barnard 1b. The gas-grain model Nautilus is then used to model the sulphur\nchemistry and explore the impact of photo-desorption and chemical desorption on\nthe H$_2$S abundance. Our model shows that chemical desorption is the main\nsource of gas-phase H$_2$S in dark cores. The measured H$_{2}$S abundance can\nonly be fitted if we assume that the chemical desorption rate decreases by more\nthan a factor of 10 when $n_{\\rm H}>2\\times10^{4}$. This change in the\ndesorption rate is consistent with the formation of thick H$_2$O and CO ice\nmantles on grain surfaces. The observed SO and H$_2$S abundances are in good\nagreement with our predictions adopting an undepleted value of the sulphur\nabundance. However, the CS abundance is overestimated by a factor of $5-10$.\nAlong the three cores, atomic S is predicted to be the main sulphur reservoir.\nWe conclude that the gaseous H$_2$S abundance is well reproduced, assuming\nundepleted sulphur abundance and chemical desorption as the main source of\nH$_2$S. The behavior of the observed H$_{2}$S abundance suggests a changing\ndesorption efficiency, which would probe the snowline in these cores. Our\nmodel, however, overestimates the observed gas-phase CS abundance. Given the\nuncertainty in the sulphur chemistry, our data are consistent with a cosmic\nelemental S abundance with an uncertainty of a factor of 10.",

Only stable CO gas is\nobserved, with a column density N(CO) = (6.3 +/- 0.3) x 10^{14} cm{-2}. An\nunusual ratio of the column densities of {12}^CO to {13}^CO is found (R = 15\n+/- 2). The large difference between the column densities of CI and CO\nindicates that photodissociation of CO is not the primary source of CI gas in\nthe disk, contrary to previous suggestion.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we outline the use of Mixture Models in density estimation of\nlarge astronomical databases. This method of density estimation has been known\nin Statistics for some time but has not been implemented because of the large\ncomputational cost. Herein, we detail an implementation of the Mixture Model\ndensity estimation based on multi-resolutional KD-trees which makes this\nstatistical technique into a computationally tractable problem. We provide the\ntheoretical and experimental background for using a mixture model of Gaussians\nbased on the Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm. Applying these analyses\nto simulated data sets we show that the EM algorithm - using the AIC penalized\nlikelihood to score the fit - out-performs the best kernel density estimate of\nthe distribution while requiring no ``fine--tuning'' of the input algorithm\nparameters. We find that EM can accurately recover the underlying density\ndistribution from point processes thus providing an efficient adaptive\nsmoothing method for astronomical source catalogs. To demonstrate the general\napplication of this statistic to astrophysical problems we consider two cases\nof density estimation: the clustering of galaxies in redshift space and the\nclustering of stars in color space. From these data we show that EM provides an\nadaptive smoothing of the distribution of galaxies in redshift space\n(describing accurately both the small and large-scale features within the data)\nand a means of identifying outliers in multi-dimensional color-color space\n(e.g. for the identification of high redshift QSOs). Automated tools such as\nthose based on the EM algorithm will be needed in the analysis of the next\ngeneration of astronomical catalogs (2MASS, FIRST, PLANCK, SDSS) and ultimately\nin in the development of the National Virtual Observatory.",

We used the BIMA array in combination with IRAM 30-m\nand NRAO 12-m observations. The GMC's in which the regions are embedded were\nstudied by means of KOSMA 3-m CO(2-1) observations. The properties the CO and\nCS clumps are analyzed and compared with newly derived results of previously\npublished single-dish measurements of local clouds (OrionB South and Rosette).\nWe find that the slopes of the clump mass distributions (-1.28 and -1.49, for\nWB89 85 and WB89 380, respectively) are somewhat less steep than found for most\nlocal clouds, but similar to those of clouds which have been analyzed with the\nsame clumpfind program. We investigate the clump stability by using the virial\ntheorem, including all possible contributions (gravity, turbulence, magnetic\nfields, and pressure due to the interclump gas). It appears that under\nreasonable assumptions a combination of these forces would render most clumps\nstable. Comparing only gravity and turbulence, we find that in the far-outer\nGalaxy clouds, these forces are in equilibium (virial parameter alpha~1) for\nclumps down to the lowest masses found (a few Msol). For clumps in the local\nclouds alpha~1 only for clumps with masses larger than a few tens of Msol. Thus\nit appears that in these outer Galaxy clumps gravity is the dominant force down\nto a much lower mass than in local clouds, implying that gravitational collapse\nand star formation may occur more readily even in the smallest clumps. Although\nthere are some caveats, due to the inhomogeneity of the data used, this might\nexplain the apparently steeper IMF found in the outer Galaxy.",

These data have finest angular\nresolution of approximately 2\" (0.0034 pc) and finest velocity resolution of\n0.13 km/s. Infall motions are seen from inverse P-Cygni profiles observed in\nH2CO 3_12-2_11 toward both objects, but also in CS 3-2 and N2H+ 1-0 toward 4A,\nproviding the least ambiguous evidence for such motions toward low-mass\nprotostellar objects.

This confirms the inference of a thermally\nsupported cloud drawn previously from deep infrared extinction measurements.\nThe rotational kinetic energy is found to be only a few percent of the\ngravitational potential energy, indicating that the contribution of rotation to\nthe overall stability of the cloud is insignificant. Finally, our observations\nshow that CS line is optically thick and self-reversed across nearly the entire\nprojected surface of the cloud. The shapes of the self-reversed profiles are\nasymmetric and are found to vary across the cloud in such a manner that the\npresence of both inward and outward motions are observed within the cloud.\nMoreover, these motions appear to be globally organized in a clear and\nsystematic alternating spatial pattern which is suggestive of a small\namplitude, non-radial oscillation or pulsation of the outer layers of the cloud\nabout an equilibrium configuration.",

The molecular clouds are the ones that give birth to rich stellar\nclusters and/or very massive (O7-O4) stars. Our data show that the clouds are\nvery clumpy and of irregular morphology. They usually have much larger masses,\nvelocity dispersions, and fractions of dense gas than molecular clouds that\nform early B or late O stars. This is compatible with earlier findings that\nmore massive stars form in more massive cores. 13CO cores are in general\nassociated with compact HII regions regardless of the presence of UC HII\nregions therein. In contrast, CS cores are preferentially associated with\ncompact HII regions that contain UC HII regions. As with the fact that the\ncompact HII regions containing UC HII regions are more compact than those not\nassociated with UC HII regions, these indicate that the former may be in an\nearlier evolutionary phase than the latter. The diffuse extended envelopes of\nHII regions often develop in the direction of decreasing molecular gas density.\nBased on detailed comparison of molecular line data with radio continuum and\nrecombination line data, the extended ionized envelopes are likely the results\nof champagne flows in at least 10 sources in our sample. Together these results\nappear to support a published suggestion that the extended emission around UC\nHII regions can be naturally understood by combining the champagne flow model\nwith the hierarchical structure of molecular clouds.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed study of the chemistry in the outflow\nassociated with the low-mass protostar NGC1333-IRAS2A down to 3\" (650 AU)\nscales. Millimeter-wavelength aperture-synthesis observations from the OVRO and\nBIMA interferometers and (sub)millimeter single-dish observations from the\nOnsala 20m telescope and CSO are presented. The interaction of the highly\ncollimated protostellar outflow with a molecular condensation ~15000 AU from\nthe central protostar is clearly traced by molecular species such as HCN, SiO,\nSO, CS, and CH3OH. Especially SiO traces a narrow high velocity component at\nthe interface between the outflow and the molecular condensation.\nMulti-transition single-dish observations are used to distinguish the chemistry\nof the shock from that of the molecular condensation and to address the\nphysical conditions therein. Statistical equilibrium calculations reveal\ntemperatures of 20 and 70 K for the quiescent and shocked components,\nrespectively, and densities near 10^6 cm^{-3}. Significant abundance\nenhancements of two to four orders of magnitude are found in the shocked region\nfor molecules such as CH3OH, SiO and the sulfur-bearing molecules. HCO+ is seen\nonly in the aftermath of the shock consistent with models where it is destroyed\nthrough release of H2O from grain mantles in the shock. N2H+ shows narrow\nlines, not affected by the outflow but rather probing the ambient cloud.\nDifferences in abundances of HCN, H2CO and CS are seen between different\noutflow regions and are suggested to be related to differences in the atomic\ncarbon abundance. Compared to the warm inner parts of protostellar envelopes,\nhigher abundances of in particular CH3OH and SiO are found in the outflows,\nwhich may be related to density differences between the regions.",

Lines of 8 molecular species\nincluding CN, C18O, CS, C34S, HCN, H13CN, HCO+ and N2H+ have been observed\nusing the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array. Continuum emission\nat 2.7-3.4 millimeter is well-fit by a pure envelope model down to the\nsensitivity of the interferometer without introducing a disk/compact source, in\ncontrast to what is seen for other protostars. A velocity gradient in the\ndensest material is traced by HCN, CS and N2H+, and is perpendicular to the\nlarge-scale CO outflow, with a pattern consistent with rotation around a 1\nsolar mass central object. Velocity gradients in the propagation direction of\nthe outflow suggest a clear interaction between the outflowing material and\n\"quiescent\" core. The C18O observations are fit with a \"drop\" abundance profile\nwhere CO is frozen-out in a region of the envelope with temperatures lower than\n40 K and densities higher than 1.5e5 cm^{-3}, which is also required to\nreproduce single-dish observations. The N2H+ emission strongly resembles that\nof NH3 and is found to be absent toward the central continuum source. This is a\ndirect consequence of the high CO abundances in the inner region as illustrated\nby a chemical model for the L483 envelope. The observed CN emission forms a\nspatial borderline between the outflowing and quiescent material probed by,\nrespectively, HCO+ and N2H+, and also shows intermediate velocities compared to\nthese two species.

A phenomenological model of prestellar core evolution, a\ntime-dependent chemical model, and a radiative transfer simulation for\nmolecular lines are combined to reconstruct the chemical and kinematical\nstructure of this core. We developed a general criterion that allows to\nquantify the difference between observed and simulated spectral maps.

The most probable $S$ value for CB17 is 0.3--0.5. The spatial\ndistribution of the intensities and self-absorption features of optically thick\nlines is indicative of UV irradiation of the core. By fitting simultaneously\noptically thin and optically thick transitions, we isolate the model that\nreproduces all the available spectral maps to a reasonable accuracy.

We found close\nrelation between the intensities of the HCN and N2H+ lines. This implies that\nthe HCN is not much depleted in the central regions of the cores. In some\ncores, the HCN spectra show different sign of asymmetry from other molecular\nlines. A few cores show various signs of asymmetry in individual HCN hyperfine\nlines. The distribution of the velocity shift dV of the HCN profiles with\nrespect to the systemic velocity of the optically thin tracer is found to be\nmore shifted toward bluer side than those of other infall tracers, indicating\nthat the HCN traces inward motions more frequently. The dV distribution of each\nHCN hyperfine line for all sources is similar. Moreover the dV values obtained\nfrom different HCN hyperfine lines for each source are nearly similar. These\nmay mean that most of starless cores are in similar kinematic states across the\nlayers of the cores.

The relationships between the\nconcentration of metal in the growth medium, Cs, the concentration of metal\nabsorbed by the plant, Cp, and the total biomass achieved, M, all of which are\nfactors relevant to the efficiency of phytoremediation of the plant, have been\ninvestigated via the macro-physiological response of Brassica juncea seedlings\nto Ni(II) stress. The factorial growth experiments treated the Ni(II)\nconcentration in the agar gel and the diurnal light quanta (DLQ) as\nindependently variable parameters. Observations included the evidence of light\nenhancement of Ni toxicity at the root as well as at the whole plant level, the\nshoot mass index as a possible indicator of shoot metal sequestration in B.\njuncea, the logarithmic variation of Cp with Cs and the power-law dependence of\nM on Cp. The sum total of these observations indicate that for the metal\naccumulator B. juncea with regard to its capacity to accumulate Ni, the overall\nmetabolic nature of the plant is important; neither rapid biomass increase nor\na high metal concentration capability favor the removal of high metal mass from\nthe medium, but rather the plant with the moderate photosynthetically driven\nbiomass growth and moderate metal concentrations demonstrated the ability to\nremove the maximum mass of metal from the medium. The implications of these\nobservations in the context of the perceived need in phytoremediation\nengineering to maximize Cp and M simultaneously in the same plant, are\ndiscussed.",

    "abstract": "We present high spatial resolution maps, obtained with the Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer, of the blue lobe of the L1157 outflow. We observed four lines\nat 3 mm, namely CH3OH (2_K-1_K), HC3N (11-10), HCN (1-0) and OCS (7-6).\nMoreover, the bright B1 clump has also been observed at better spatial\nresolution in CS (2-1), CH3OH (2_1-1_1)A-, and 34SO (3_2-2_1). These high\nspatial resolution observations show a very rich structure in all the tracers,\nrevealing a clumpy structure of the gas superimposed to an extended emission.\nIn fact, the three clumps detected by previous IRAM-30m single dish\nobservations have been resolved into several sub-clumps and new clumps have\nbeen detected in the outflow. The clumps are associated with the two cavities\ncreated by two shock episodes driven by the precessing jet. In particular, the\nclumps nearest the protostar are located at the walls of the younger cavity\nwith a clear arch-shape form while the farthest clumps have slightly different\nobservational characteristics indicating that they are associated to the older\nshock episode. The emission of the observed species peaks in different part of\nthe lobe: the east clumps are brighter in HC3N (11-10), HCN (1-0) and CS (2-1)\nwhile the west clumps are brighter in CH3OH(2_K-1_K), OCS (7-6) and 34SO\n(3_2-2_1). This peak displacement in the line emission suggests a variation of\nthe physical conditions and/or the chemical composition along the lobe of the\noutflow at small scale, likely related to the shock activity and the precession\nof the outflow. In particular, we observe the decoupling of the silicon\nmonoxide and methanol emission, common shock tracers, in the B1 clump located\nat the apex of the bow shock produced by the second shock episode.",

For the solar\ngiant stages, mass-loss by the cool (but not dust-driven) wind is considered in\ndetail. Using the new and well-calibrated mass-loss formula of Schroder & Cuntz\n(2005, 2007), we find that the mass lost by the Sun as an RGB giant (0.332\nM_Sun, 7.59 Gy from now) potentially gives planet Earth a significant orbital\nexpansion, inversely proportional to the remaining solar mass.\n  According to these solar evolution models, the closest encounter of planet\nEarth with the solar cool giant photosphere will occur during the tip-RGB\nphase. During this critical episode, for each time-step of the evolution model,\nwe consider the loss of orbital angular momentum suffered by planet Earth from\ntidal interaction with the giant Sun, as well as dynamical drag in the lower\nchromosphere. We find that planet Earth will not be able to escape engulfment,\ndespite the positive effect of solar mass-loss. In order to survive the solar\ntip-RGB phase, any hypothetical planet would require a present-day minimum\norbital radius of about 1.15 AU.\n  Furthermore, our solar evolution models with detailed mass-loss description\npredict that the resulting tip-AGB giant will not reach its tip-RGB size. The\nmain reason is the more significant amount of mass lost already in the RGB\nphase of the Sun. Hence, the tip-AGB luminosity will come short of driving a\nfinal, dust-driven superwind, and there will be no regular solar planetary\nnebula (PN). But a last thermal pulse may produce a circumstellar (CS) shell\nsimilar to, but rather smaller than, that of the peculiar PN IC 2149 with an\nestimated total CS shell mass of just a few hundredths of a solar mass.",

IRAS 18151-1208 is a nearby massive region (d =\n3kpc, L ~ 20000 Lsun) which splits into three cores: MM1, MM2 and MM3\n(separated by 1'-2'). We aim at (1) studying the physical and chemical\nproperties of the individual MM1, MM2 and MM3 cores; (2) deriving their\nevolutionary stages; (3) using these results to improve our view of the\nevolutionary sequence of massive cores. The region was observed in the CS,\nC34S, H2CO, HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ lines at mm wavelengths with the IRAM 30m\nand Mopra telescopes. We use 1D and 2D modeling of the dust continuum to derive\nthe density and temperature distributions, which are then used in the RATRAN\ncode to model the lines and constrain the abundances of the observed species.\nAll the lines were detected in MM1 and MM2. MM3 shows weaker emission, or even\nis undetected in HCO+ and all isotopic species. MM2 is driving a newly\ndiscovered CO outflow and hosts a mid-IR-quiet massive protostar. The abundance\nof CS is significantly larger in MM1 than in MM2, but smaller than in a\nreference massive protostar such as AFGL2591. In contrast the N2H+ abundance\ndecreases from MM2 to MM1, and is larger than in AFGL2591. Both MM1 and MM2\nhost an early phase massive protostar, but MM2 (and mid-IR-quiet sources in\ngeneral) is younger and more dominated by the host protostar than MM1\n(mid-IR-bright). The MM3 core is probably in a pre-stellar phase. We find that\nthe N2H+/C34S ratio varies systematically with age in the massive protostars\nfor which the data are available.

It will, though, be very challenging to extract the cosmological signal\n(CS) from foregrounds and noise which are orders of magnitude larger.\nFortunately, the signal has some characteristics which differentiate it from\nthe foregrounds and noise, and we suggest that using the correct statistics may\ntease out signatures of reionization. We generate mock datacubes simulating the\noutput of the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) EoR experiment. These cubes combine\nrealistic models for Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds and the noise with\nthree different simulations of the CS. We fit out the foregrounds, which are\nsmooth in the frequency direction, to produce residual images in each frequency\nband. We denoise these images and study the skewness of the one-point\ndistribution in the images as a function of frequency. We find that, under\nsufficiently optimistic assumptions, we can recover the main features of the\nredshift evolution of the skewness in the 21cm signal. We argue that some of\nthese features - such as a dip at the onset of reionization, followed by a rise\ntowards its later stages - may be generic, and give us a promising route to a\nstatistical detection of reionization.",

Based on near infrared\nphotometry we search for YSO candidates in the region and propos that 2MASS\n18565878+0116233 is the infrared point source associated with IRAS 18544+0112.\nFinally, we suggest that the expansion of a larger nearby HII region,\nG034.8-0.7, might be related to the formation of IRAS 18544+0112.",

    "title": "CMB polarization as a probe of the anomalous nature of the Cold Spot",
    "abstract": "One of the most interesting explanations for the non-Gaussian Cold Spot (CS)\ndetected in the WMAP data by Vielva et al. 2004, is that it arises from the\ninteraction of the CMB radiation with a cosmic texture (Cruz et al. 2007b). In\nthis case, a lack of polarization is expected in the region of the spot, as\ncompared to the typical values associated to large fluctuations of a GIRF. In\naddition, other physical processes related to a non-linear evolution of the\ngravitational field could lead to a similar scenario. However, some of these\nalternative scenarios (e.g., a large void in the large scale structure) have\nbeen shown to be very unlikely. In this work we characterise the polarization\nproperties of the Cold Spot under both hypotheses: a large Gaussian spot and an\nanomalous feature generated, for instance, by a cosmic texture. We propose a\nmethodology to distinguish between them, and we discuss its discrimination\npower as a function of the instrumental noise level. In particular, we address\nthe cases of current experiments, like WMAP and Planck, and others in\ndevelopment as QUIJOTE. We find that for an ideal experiment the Gaussian\nhypothesis could be rejected at a significance level better than 0.8%. While\nWMAP is far from providing useful information in this respect, we find that\nPlanck will be able to reach a significance of around 7%; in addition, we show\nthat the ground-based experiment QUIJOTE could provide a significance of around\n1%. If these results are combined with the significance level found for the CS\nin temperature, the capability of QUIJOTE and Planck to reject the alternative\nhypothesis becomes 0.025% and 0.124%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The formation of massive stars is a highly complex process in which it is not\nclear whether the star-forming gas is in global gravitational collapse or in an\nequilibrium state, supported by turbulence. By studying one of the most massive\nand dense star-forming regions in the Galaxy at a distance of less than 3 kpc,\nthe filament containing the well-known sources DR21 and DR21(OH), we expect to\nfind observational signatures that allow to discriminate between the two views.\nWe use molecular line data from our 13CO 1-0, CS 2-1, and N2H+ 1-0 survey of\nthe Cygnus X region obtained with the FCRAO and high-angular resolution\nobservations of CO, CS, HCO+, N2H+, and H2CO, obtained with the IRAM 30m\ntelescope. We observe a complex velocity field and velocity dispersion in the\nDR21 filament in which regions of highest column-density, i.e. dense cores,\nhave a lower velocity dispersion than the surrounding gas and velocity\ngradients that are not (only) due to rotation. Infall signatures in optically\nthick line profiles of HCO+ and 12CO are observed along and across the whole\nDR21 filament. From modelling the observed spectra, we obtain a typical infall\nspeed of 0.6 km/s and mass accretion rates of the order of a few 10^-3 Msun/yr\nfor the two main clumps constituting the filament. These massive (4900 and 3300\nMsun) clumps are both gravitationally contracting. All observed kinematic\nfeatures in the DR21 filament can be explained if it is formed by the\nconvergence of flows at large scales and is now in a state of global\ngravitational collapse. Whether this convergence of flows originated from\nself-gravity at larger scales or from other processes can not be settled with\nthe present study. The observed velocity field and velocity dispersion are\nconsistent with results from (magneto)-hydrodynamic simulations where the cores\nlie at the stagnation points of convergent turbulent flows.",

    "abstract": "Mon R2, at a distance of 830 pc, is the only ultracompact HII region (UC HII)\nwhere the photon-dominated region (PDR) between the ionized gas and the\nmolecular cloud can be resolved with Herschel. HIFI observations of the\nabundant compounds 13CO, C18O, o-H2-18O, HCO+, CS, CH, and NH have been used to\nderive the physical and chemical conditions in the PDR, in particular the water\nabundance. The 13CO, C18O, o-H2-18O, HCO+ and CS observations are well\ndescribed assuming that the emission is coming from a dense (n=5E6 cm-3,\nN(H2)>1E22 cm-2) layer of molecular gas around the UC HII. Based on our\no-H2-18O observations, we estimate an o-H2O abundance of ~2E-8. This is the\naverage ortho-water abundance in the PDR. Additional H2-18O and/or water lines\nare required to derive the water abundance profile. A lower density envelope\n(n~1E5 cm-3, N(H2)=2-5E22 cm-2) is responsible for the absorption in the NH\n1_1-0_2 line. The emission of the CH ground state triplet is coming from both\nregions with a complex and self-absorbed profile in the main component. The\nradiative transfer modeling shows that the 13CO and HCO+ line profiles are\nconsistent with an expansion of the molecular gas with a velocity law, v_e =0.5\nx (r/Rout)^{-1} km/s, although the expansion velocity is poorly constrained by\nthe observations presented here.",

    "abstract": "To better characterize the abundance patterns produced by the r-process, we\nhave derived new abundances or upper limits for the heavy elements zinc (Zn),\nyttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), europium (Eu), and lead (Pb). Our sample of 161\nmetal-poor stars includes new measurements from 88 high resolution and high\nsignal-to-noise spectra obtained with the Tull Spectrograph on the 2.7m Smith\nTelescope at McDonald Observatory, and other abundances are adopted from the\nliterature. We use models of the s-process in AGB stars to characterize the\nhigh Pb/Eu ratios produced in the s-process at low metallicity, and our new\nobservations then allow us to identify a sample of stars with no detectable\ns-process material. In these stars, we find no significant increase in the\nPb/Eu ratios with increasing metallicity. This suggests that s-process material\nwas not widely dispersed until the overall Galactic metallicity grew\nconsiderably, perhaps even as high as [Fe/H]=-1.4. We identify a dispersion of\nat least 0.5 dex in [La/Eu] in metal-poor stars with [Eu/Fe]<+0.6 attributable\nto the r-process, suggesting that there is no unique \"pure\" r-process elemental\nratio among pairs of rare earth elements.

We can reproduce the range of Y/Eu ratios using\nsimulations of high-entropy neutrino winds of core-collapse supernovae that\ninclude charged-particle and neutron-capture components of r-process\nnucleosynthesis. The heavy element abundance patterns in most metal-poor stars\ndo not resemble that of CS 22892-052, but the presence of heavy elements such\nas Ba in nearly all metal-poor stars without s-process enrichment suggests that\nthe r-process is a common phenomenon.",

The mapped\nregion includes the circumnuclear disk (CND) and the two surrounding giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs) of the Sgr A complex, known as the 20 and 50 km s^{-1}\nmolecular clouds.Additionally, we simultaneously observed the J=2-1 and 3-2\ntransitions of SiO toward selected positions to estimate the physical\nconditions of the molecular gas. The SiO(2-1) and H^{13}CO+(1-0) emission\ncovers the same velocity range and presents a similar distribution. In\ncontrast, HNCO(5-4) emission appears in a narrow velocity range mostly\nconcentrated in the 20 and 50 km s^{-1} GMCs. The HNCO column densities and\nfractional abundances present the highest contrast, with difference factors of\n$\\geq$60 and 28, respectively. Their highest values are found toward the cores\nof the GMCs, whereas the lowest ones are measured at the CND. SiO abundances do\nnot follow this trend, with high values found toward the CND, as well as the\nGMCs. By comparing our abundances with those of prototypical Galactic sources\nwe conclude that HNCO, similar to SiO, is ejected from grain mantles into\ngas-phase by nondissociative C-shocks. This results in the high abundances\nmeasured toward the CND and the GMCs. However, the strong UV radiation from the\nCentral cluster utterly photodissociates HNCO as we get closer to the center,\nwhereas SiO seems to be more resistant against UV-photons or it is produced\nmore efficiently by the strong shocks in the CND. Finally, we discuss the\npossible connections between the molecular gas at the CND and the GMCs using\nthe HNCO/SiO, SiO/CS, and HNCO/CS intensity ratios as probes of distance to the\nCentral cluster.",

Out of ~160\nspectral features, this paper uses the 35 that are spatially resolved.\n  The observed spatial distributions of a selection of six species are compared\nwith radiative transfer models based on a static spherically symmetric\nstructure, a dynamic spherical structure, and a static flattened structure. The\nmaps of CO and its isotopic variations exhibit elongated geometries on scales\nof ~100\", and smaller scale substructure is found in maps of N2H+, o-H2CO, CS,\nSO2, CCH, and methanol lines. A velocity gradient is apparent in maps of all\nmolecular lines presented here, except SO, SO2, and H2CO. We find two emission\npeaks in warm (Eup~200K) methanol separated by 12\", indicative of a secondary\nheating source in the envelope.\n  The spherical models are able to explain the distribution of emission for the\noptically thin H13CO+ and C34S, but not for the optically thick HCN, HCO+, and\nCS, nor for the optically thin C17O. The introduction of velocity structure\nmitigates the optical depth effects, but does not fully explain the\nobservations, especially in the spectral dimension. A static flattened envelope\nviewed at a small inclination angle does slightly better.\n  We conclude that a geometry of the envelope other than an isotropic static\nsphere is needed to circumvent line optical depth effects. We propose that this\ncould be achieved in envelope models with an outflow cavity and/or\ninhomogeneous structure at scales smaller than ~10^4 AU.

Here we describe the beginning of our investigation into\nthe strength of this correlation utilising new multi-line millimeter data from\nthe Mopra CMZ and HOP surveys and multi-wavelength GBT radio continuum\nobservations towards the CMZ and compare these in detail with the diffuse TeV\ngamma-ray emission from HESS. The benefit of these new data is that they allow\nus to simultaneously observe and analyse correlations using a large number\n(>10) of molecular species, some of which contain their isotopologue pairs. The\nuse of isotopologue pairs is especially powerful, since it allows one to\nanalyse the optical depth of a number of different molecular species, thus\ninvestigating the nature of the correlation over a range of different physical\nconditions. Here we begin by comparing the integrated line emission and\ncontinuum radio emission with the diffuse gamma-ray emission, and, by using\nisotopologue pairs such as HCN/H$^{13}$CN, obtain optical depths throughout the\nCMZ corresponding to regions of both strong and weak gamma-ray emission. We\nfind that the radio continuum better matches the peak of the gamma-ray\nemission, which corresponds to the more compact -- compared to the relatively\ncoarse resolution of the gamma-ray images -- sources in the CMZ. Using the\nisotopologue pairs, we find that the optical depth at all positions and\nvelocities within the CMZ are about 2--4. This is similar to that found for the\nCS(1--0) line and would underestimate the mass of the CMZ, potentially\nexplaining why molecular line emission peaks appear offset from the gamma-ray\npeaks.",

FMU is located in Fukushima city, and is 57 km (35 miles)\naway from northwest of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. This paper\npresents three types of radiation survey undertaken through the unprecedented\naccidents at the campus and the hospital of FMU. First, a group of interested\npeople immediately began radiation surveillance; the group members were\nassembled from the faculty members of \"Life Sciences and Social Medicine\" and\n\"Human and Natural Sciences\". Second, the present author, regardless of the\nearthquake, had serially observed natural radiations such as gamma radiation in\nair with NaI scintillation counter, atmospheric radon with Lucas cell, and\nsecond cosmic rays with NaI scintillation. Gamma radiation indicated most\ndrastic change, i.e., peak value (9.3 times usual level) appeared on March 16,\nand decreased to 1.7 times usual level after two months. A nonlinear least\nsquares regression to this decreasing data gave short half-life of 3.6 days and\nlong half-life of 181 days. These two apparent half-lives are attributed to two\ngroups of radioisotopes, i.e., short half-life one of I-131 and long half-life\nones of Cs-134, Cs-137 and Sr-90. Also, atmospheric radon concentration became\nhigh since a stop of ventilation, while second cosmic rays did not show any\nresponse.

Main findings of this work include: 1) Under the CS framework, image\nquality has little degradation over a large dose range, and the degradation\nbecomes evident when the dose < 100 total mAs. A dose < 40 total mAs leads to a\ndramatic image degradation. Optimal low-dose CBCT scan protocols likely fall in\nthe dose range of 40-100 total mAs, depending on the specific IGRT\napplications. 2) Among different scan protocols at a constant low-dose level,\nthe super sparse-view reconstruction with projection number less than 50 is the\nmost challenging case, even with strong regularization. Better image quality\ncan be acquired with other low mAs protocols. 3) The optimal scan protocol is\nthe combination of a medium number of projections and a medium level of\nmAs/view. This is more evident when the dose is around 72.8 total mAs or below\nand when the ROI is a low-contrast or high-resolution object. Based on our\nresults, the optimal number of projections is around 90 to 120. 4) The\nclinically acceptable lowest dose level is task dependent. In our study,\n72.8mAs is a safe dose level for visualizing low-contrast objects, while 12.2\ntotal mAs is sufficient for detecting high-contrast objects of diameter greater\nthan 3 mm.",

    "title": "Line Profiles of Cores within Clusters: I. The Anatomy of a Filament",
    "abstract": "Observations are revealing the ubiquity of filamentary structures in\nmolecular clouds. As cores are often embedded in filaments, it is important to\nunderstand how line profiles from such systems differ from those of isolated\ncores. We perform radiative transfer calculations on a hydrodynamic simulation\nof a molecular cloud in order to model line emission from collapsing cores\nembedded in filaments. We model two optically thick lines, CS(2-1) and\nHCN(1-0), and one optically thin line, N2H+(1-0), from three embedded cores. In\nthe hydrodynamic simulation, gas self-gravity, turbulence, and bulk flows\ncreate filamentary regions within which cores form. Though the filaments have\nlarge dispersions, the N2H+(1-0) lines indicate subsonic velocities within the\ncores. We find that the observed optically thick line profiles of CS(2-1) and\nHCN(1-0) vary drastically with viewing angle. In over 50% of viewing angles,\nthere is no sign of a blue asymmetry, an idealised signature of infall motions\nin an isolated spherical collapsing core. Profiles which primarily trace the\ncores, with little contribution from the surrounding filament, are\ncharacterised by a systematically higher HCN(1-0) peak intensity. The N2H+(1-0)\nlines do not follow this trend. We demonstrate that red asymmetric profiles are\nalso feasible in the optically thick lines, due to emission from the filament\nor one-sided accretion flows onto the core. We conclude that embedded cores may\nfrequently undergo collapse without showing a blue asymmetric profile, and that\nobservational surveys including filamentary regions may underestimate the\nnumber of collapsing cores if based solely on profile shapes of optically thick\nlines.",

    "abstract": "Functional logic programming (FLP) languages use non-terminating and\nnon-confluent constructor systems (CS's) as programs in order to define\nnon-strict non-determi-nistic functions. Two semantic alternatives have been\nusually considered for parameter passing with this kind of functions: call-time\nchoice and run-time choice. While the former is the standard choice of modern\nFLP languages, the latter lacks some properties---mainly\ncompositionality---that have prevented its use in practical FLP systems.\nTraditionally it has been considered that call-time choice induces a singular\ndenotational semantics, while run-time choice induces a plural semantics. We\nhave discovered that this latter identification is wrong when pattern matching\nis involved, and thus we propose two novel compositional plural semantics for\nCS's that are different from run-time choice.\n  We study the basic properties of our plural semantics---compositionality,\npolarity, monotonicity for substitutions, and a restricted form of the bubbling\nproperty for constructor systems---and the relation between them and to\nprevious proposals, concluding that these semantics form a hierarchy in the\nsense of set inclusion of the set of computed values. We have also identified a\nclass of programs characterized by a syntactic criterion for which the proposed\nplural semantics behave the same, and a program transformation that can be used\nto simulate one of them by term rewriting. At the practical level, we study how\nto use the expressive capabilities of these semantics for improving the\ndeclarative flavour of programs. We also propose a language which combines\ncall-time choice and our plural semantics, that we have implemented in Maude.\nThe resulting interpreter is employed to test several significant examples\nshowing the capabilities of the combined semantics.\n  To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)",

The line\nemission from several molecules in the coma was measured with high\nsignal-to-noise ratio in January 2005 at heliocentric distance of 1.2 AU by\nmeans of high-resolution spectroscopic observations using the Submillimeter\nTelescope (SMT). We have obtained production rates of several volatiles (CH3OH,\nHCN, H13CN, HNC, H2CO, CO and CS) by comparing the observed and simulated\nline-integrated intensities. Furthermore, multiline observations of the CH3OH\n(7-6) series allow us to estimate the rotational temperature using the rotation\ndiagram technique. We find that the CH3OH population distribution of the levels\nsampled by these lines can be described by a rotational temperature of 40 \\pm 3\nK.

The measured relative molecular\nabundances in C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) are between low- to typical values of those\nobtained in Oort Cloud comets, suggesting that it has visited the inner solar\nsystem previously and undergone thermal processing. The HNC/HCN abundance ratio\nof ~3.1% is comparable to that found in other comets, accounting for the\ndependence on the heliocentric distance, and could possibly be explained by\nion-molecule chemical processes in the low-temperature atmosphere. From a\ntentative H13CN detection, the measured value of 97 \\pm 30 for the H12CN/H13CN\nisotopologue pair is consistent with a telluric value.",

We aim to determine the\ndynamical state of the First Hydrostatic Core candidate Cha-MMS1. We observed\nCha-MMS1 in various transitions with the APEX and Mopra telescopes. The\nmolecular emission was modeled with a radiative transfer code to derive\nconstraints on the envelope kinematics. We derive an internal luminosity of\n0.08 - 0.18 Lsol. An average velocity gradient of 3.1(0.1) km/s/pc over 0.08 pc\nis found perpendicular to the filament in which Cha-MMS1 is embedded. The\ngradient is flatter in the outer parts and at the innermost 2000 - 4000 AU.\nThese features suggest solid-body rotation beyond 4000 AU and slower,\ndifferential rotation beyond 8000 AU. The origin of the flatter gradient in the\ninnermost parts is unclear. The classical infall signature is detected in HCO+\n3-2 and CS 2-1. The radiative transfer modeling indicates a uniform infall\nvelocity in the outer parts of the envelope. An infall velocity field scaling\nwith r^(-0.5) is consistent with the data for r < 9000 AU. The infall\nvelocities are 0.1 - 0.2 km/s at r > 3300 AU and 0.04 - 0.6 km/s at r < 3300\nAU. Both the internal luminosity of Cha-MMS1 and the infall velocity field in\nits envelope are consistent with predictions of MHD simulations for the first\ncore phase. There is no evidence for a fast, large-scale outflow stemming from\nCha-MMS1 but excess emission from the high-density tracers CS 5-4, CO 6-5, and\nCO 7-6 suggests the presence of higher-velocity material at the inner core. Its\ninternal luminosity excludes Cha-MMS1 being a prestellar core. The kinematical\nproperties of its envelope are consistent with Cha-MMS1 being a first core\ncandidate or a very young Class 0 protostar.(abridged).",

    "title": "Submillimeter-HCN Diagram for an Energy Diagnostics in the Centers of\n  Galaxies",
    "abstract": "Compiling data from literature and the ALMA archive, we show enhanced\nHCN(4-3)/HCO$^+$(4-3) and/or HCN(4-3)/CS(7-6) integrated intensity ratios in\ncircumnuclear molecular gas around active galactic nuclei (AGNs) compared to\nthose in starburst (SB) galaxies (submillimeter HCN-enhancement). The number of\nsample galaxies is significantly increased from our previous work. We expect\nthis feature could potentially be an extinction-free energy diagnostic tool of\nnuclear regions of galaxies. Non-LTE radiative transfer modelings of the above\nmolecular emission lines involving both collisional and radiative excitation,\nas well as a photon trapping effect were conducted to investigate the cause of\nthe high line ratios in AGNs. As a result, we found that enhanced abundance\nratios of HCN-to-HCO$^+$ and HCN-to-CS in AGNs as compared to SB galaxies by a\nfactor of a few to even $>$ 10 is a plausible explanation for the submillimeter\nHCN-enhancement. However, a counter argument of a systematically higher gas\ndensity in AGNs than in SB galaxies can also be a plausible scenario. Although\nwe could not fully discriminate these two scenarios at this moment due to\ninsufficient amount of multi-transition, multi-species data, the former\nscenario equivalently claims for abnormal chemical composition in AGNs.\nRegarding the actual mechanism to realize the composition, we suggest it is\ndifficult with conventional gas phase X-ray dominated region (XDR) ionization\nmodels to reproduce the observed high line ratios. We might have to take into\naccount other mechanisms such as neutral-neutral reactions that are efficiently\nactivated at high temperature environments and/or mechanically heated regions\nto further understand the high line ratios in AGNs.",

    "abstract": "We report the detection of a wing component in NH$_3$ emission toward the\nstarless core TUKH122 with subthermal turbulence in the Orion A cloud. This\nNH$_3$ core is suggested to be on the verge of star formation because the\nturbulence inside the NH$_3$ core is almost completely dissipated, and also\nbecause it is surrounded by CCS, which resembles the prestellar core L1544 in\nTaurus showing infall motions. Observations were carried out with the Nobeyama\n45 m telescope at 0.05 km s$^{-1}$ velocity resolution. We find that the NH$_3$\nline profile consists of two components. The quiescent main component has a\nsmall linewidth of 0.3 km s$^{-1}$ dominated by thermal motions, and the\nred-shifted wing component has a large linewidth of 1.36 km s$^{-1}$\nrepresenting turbulent motions. These components show kinetic temperatures of\n11 K and $<$ 30 K, respectively. Furthermore, there is a clear velocity offset\nbetween the NH$_3$ quiescent gas ($VLSR=3.7$ km s$^{-1}$) and the turbulent gas\n($VLSR=4.4$ km s$^{-1}$). The centroid velocity of the turbulent gas\ncorresponds to that of the surrounding gas traced by the $^{13}$CO ($J=1-0$)\nand CS ($J=2-1$) lines. LVG model calculations for CS and CO show that the\nturbulent gas has a temperature of $8-13$ K and an H$_2$ density of ~ $10^4$\ncm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the temperature of the turbulent component is also ~\n10 K. The detections of both NH$_3$ quiescent and wing components may indicate\na sharp transition from the turbulent parent cloud to the quiescent dense core.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a spatially common sparsity based adaptive channel\nestimation and feedback scheme for frequency division duplex based massive\nmulti-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, which adapts training overhead and\npilot design to reliably estimate and feed back the downlink channel state\ninformation (CSI) with significantly reduced overhead. Specifically, a\nnon-orthogonal downlink pilot design is first proposed, which is very different\nfrom standard orthogonal pilots. By exploiting the spatially common sparsity of\nmassive MIMO channels, a compressive sensing (CS) based adaptive CSI\nacquisition scheme is proposed, where the consumed time slot overhead only\nadaptively depends on the sparsity level of the channels. Additionally, a\ndistributed sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm is proposed to jointly\nestimate the channels of multiple subcarriers. Furthermore, by exploiting the\ntemporal channel correlation, a closed-loop channel tracking scheme is\nprovided, which adaptively designs the non-orthogonal pilot according to the\nprevious channel estimation to achieve an enhanced CSI acquisition. Finally, we\ngeneralize the results of the multiple-measurement-vectors case in CS and\nderive the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the proposed scheme, which enlightens us\nto design the non-orthogonal pilot signals for the improved performance.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms its\ncounterparts, and it is capable of approaching the performance bound.",

    "abstract": "(abridged) We used the IRAM 30-m to perform a sensitive wideband survey of 30\nprotoplanetary disks in the Taurus Auriga region. We simultaneously observed\nHCO$^+$(3-2), HCN(3-2), C$_2$H(3-2), CS(5-4), and two transitions of SO. We\ncombine the results with a previous survey which observed $^{13}$CO (2-1),\nCN(2-1), two o-H$_2$CO lines and one of SO. We use available interferometric\ndata to derive excitation temperatures of CN and C$_2$H in several sources. We\ndetermine characteristic sizes of the gas disks and column densities of all\nmolecules using a parametric power-law disk model. Our study is mostly\nsensitive to molecules at 200-400 au from the stars. We compare the derived\ncolumn densities to the predictions of an extensive gas-grain chemical disk\nmodel, under conditions representative of T Tauri disks. This survey provides\n20 new detections of HCO$^+$ in disks, 18 in HCN, 11 in C$_2$H, 8 in CS and 4\nin SO. HCO$^+$ is detected in almost all sources, and its J=3-2 line is\nessentially optically thick, providing good estimates of the disk radii. The\nother transitions are (at least partially) optically thin. Variations of the\ncolumn density ratios do not correlate with any specific property of the star\nor disk. Disks around Herbig Ae stars appear less rich in molecules than those\naround T Tauri stars, although the sample remains small. SO is only found in\nthe (presumably younger) embedded objects, perhaps reflecting an evolution of\nthe S chemistry due to increasing depletion with time. Overall, the molecular\ncolumn densities, and in particular the CN/HCN and CN/C$_2$H ratios, are well\nreproduced by gas-grain chemistry in cold disks. This study provides a census\nof simple molecules in disks of radii $> 200-300$ au. Extending that to smaller\ndisks, or searching for less abundant or more complex molecules requires a much\nmore sensitive facility, i.e. NOEMA and ALMA.",

    "abstract": "The long-term chemical instability and the presence of toxic Pb in otherwise\nstellar solar absorber APbX$_{3}$ have hindered their large-scale\ncommercialization. Previously explored ways to achieve Pb-free halide\nperovskites involved replacing Pb$^{2+}$ with other similar M$^{2+}$ cations in\nns$^2$ electron configuration, e.g., Sn$^{2+}$ or by Bi$^{3+}$ (plus Ag$^+$),\nbut unfortunately this showed either poor stability (M = Sn) or weakly\nabsorbing oversized indirect gaps (M = Bi), prompting concerns that perhaps\nstability and good optoelectronic properties might be contraindicated. Herein,\nwe exploit the electronic structure underpinning of classic Cu[In,Ga]Se$_{2}$\n(CIGS) chalcopyrite solar absorbers to design Pb-free halide perovskites by\ntransmuting 2Pb to the pair [B$^{IB}$ + C$^{III}$]. The resulting group of\ndouble perovskites with formula A$_2$BCX$_6$ (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Cu, Ag; C =\nGa, In; X = Cl, Br, I) benefits from the ionic, yet narrow-gap character of\nhalide perovskites, and at the same time borrows the advantage of the strong\nand rapidly rising Cu(d)/Se(p) $\\rightarrow$ Ga/In(s/p)\nvalence-to-conduction-band absorption spectra known from CIGS. This constitutes\na new group of CuIn-based Halide Perovskite (CIHP). Our first-principles\ncalculations guided by such design principles indicate that the CIHPs class has\nmembers with clear thermodynamic stability, showing rather strong direct-gap\noptical transitions, and manifesting a wide-range of tunable gap values (from\nzero to about 2.5 eV) and combination of light electron and heavy-light hole\neffective masses. Materials screening of candidate CHIPs then identifies the\nbest-of-class Rb$_2$[CuIn]Cl$_6$, Rb$_2$[AgIn]Br$_6$ and Cs$_2$[AgIn]Br$_6$,\nhaving direct band gaps of 1.36, 1.46 and 1.50 eV, and a theoretical\nspectroscopic limited maximal efficiency comparable to chalcopyrites and\nCH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$.",

    "abstract": "The wealth of high-energy (E > 50 MeV) and very-high-energy (E > 100 GeV)\ndata accumulated over the past few years have provided unprecedented\nopportunities to probe pulsar emission models. The Fermi Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) has now detected over 200 gamma-ray pulsars of vastly different ages,\nproviding an extensive dataset of spectra and light curves compared to a mere\ndecade ago. Ground-based Cherenkov telescopes deepened our appreciation of the\nmysterious richness of the pulsar mechanism by a surprise detection of pulsed\nemission up to 1 TeV from the Crab pulsar. These discoveries position us to\nmake real progress in pulsar theory. A number of studies have developed new and\nenhanced existing dissipative magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) and particle-in-cell\n(PIC) codes to solve the global electrodynamics and pursue fundamental\nquestions about magnetospheric particle injection, acceleration, and radiation.\nWhile MHD models capture the global aspects of pulsar magnetospheres, the\nmicrophysics need to be probed self-consistently by PIC simulations. Some\ndissipative MHD models consider the current sheet (CS) as an important site for\nhigh-energy curvature radiation (CR), while early PIC results point to energy\ndissipation taking place in the CS, where particles are accelerated by magnetic\nreconnection and may possibly emit $\\gamma$ rays via synchrotron radiation\n(SR). This is in marked contrast to some older local emission models that\nstudied CR gamma rays produced in gaps nearer to the spinning neutron star. The\nuniversality of these results should become clearer as current computational\nrestrictions are overcome and boundary conditions are refined. Continued and\ncombined polarimetric, spectral, and temporal measurements should aid us in\nscrutinising these new emission models in our persistent pursuit of a deeper\nunderstanding of the pulsar marvel.",

Millimeter images reveal that the envelope of IRS 3, the brightest and\nmost extended 3.8$\\mu$m Galactic center stellar source, consists of two\nsemi-circular dust shells facing the direction of Sgr A*. The outer\ncircumstellar shell at the distance of 1.6$\\times10^4$ AU, appears to break up\ninto \"fingers\" of dust directed toward Sgr A*. These features coincide with\nmolecular CS (5-4) emission and a near-IR extinction cloud distributed between\nIRS 3 and Sgr A*. The NE-SW asymmetric shape of the IRS 3 shells seen at 3.8\nmicron and radio are interpreted as structures that are tidally distorted by\nSgr A*.

These architectures extract & learn\nthe real world hierarchical visual features utilizing supervised & unsupervised\nlearning approaches respectively. Both the approaches yet cannot scale up\nrealistically to provide recognition for a very large number of objects as high\nas 10K.

This leaf level model is presented with\nthe same input object image which classifies it in a specific category.

    "abstract": "We aim to investigate the chemistry and gas phase abundance of HNCO and the\nvariation of the HNCO/CS abundance ratio as a diagnostic of the physics and\nchemistry in regions of massive star formation. A numerical-chemical model has\nbeen developed which self-consistently follows the chemical evolution of a hot\ncore. The model comprises of two distinct stages. An initial collapse phase is\nimmediately followed by an increase in temperature which represents the switch\non of a central massive star and the subsequent evolution of the chemistry in a\nhot, dense gas cloud (the hot core). During the collapse phase, gas species are\nallowed to accrete on to grain surfaces where they can participate in further\nreactions. During the hot core phase surface species thermally desorb back in\nto the ambient gas and further chemical evolution takes place. For comparison,\nthe chemical network was also used to model a simple dark cloud and\nphotodissociation regions. Our investigation reveals that HNCO is inefficiently\nformed when only gas-phase formation pathways are considered in the chemical\nnetwork with reaction rates consistent with existing laboratory data. Using\ncurrently measured gas phase reaction rates, obtaining the observed HNCO\nabundances requires its formation on grain surfaces. However our model shows\nthat the gas phase HNCO in hot cores is not a simple direct product of the\nevaporation of grain mantles. We also show that the HNCO/CS abundance ratio\nvaries as a function of time in hot cores and can match the range of values\nobserved. This ratio is not unambiguously related to the ambient UV field as\nbeen suggested - our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis of Martin et\nal (2008). In addition, our results show that this ratio is extremely sensitive\nto the initial sulphur abundance.",

The notion of\nrestricted isometry property (RIP) and an upper bound on the restricted\nisometry constant (RIC) are employed to establish sufficient conditions for the\nexact localization by MUSIC with or without the presence of noise. In the\nnoiseless case, the sufficient condition gives an upper bound on the numbers of\nrandom sampling and incident directions necessary for exact localization. In\nthe noisy case, the sufficient condition assumes additionally an upper bound\nfor the noise-to-object ratio in terms of the RIC and the condition number of\nobjects. Rigorous comparison of performance between MUSIC and the CS\nminimization principle, Lasso, is given. In general, the MUSIC algorithm\nguarantees to recover, with high probability, $s$ scatterers with $n=\\cO(s^2)$\nrandom sampling and incident directions and sufficiently high frequency. For\nthe favorable imaging geometry where the scatterers are distributed on a\ntransverse plane MUSIC guarantees to recover, with high probability, $s$\nscatterers with a median frequency and $n=\\cO(s)$ random sampling/incident\ndirections. Numerical results confirm that the Lasso outperforms MUSIC in the\nwell-resolved case while the opposite is true for the under-resolved case. The\nlatter effect indicates the superresolution capability of the MUSIC algorithm.\nAnother advantage of MUSIC over the Lasso as applied to imaging is the former's\nflexibility with grid spacing and guarantee of {\\em approximate} localization\nof sufficiently separated objects in an arbitrarily fine grid.

    "abstract": "The young X-ray and gamma-ray-bright supernova remnant RXJ1713.7-3946 (SNR\nG347.3-0.5) is believed to be associated with molecular cores that lie within\nregions of the most intense TeV emission. Using the Mopra telescope, four of\nthe densest cores were observed using high-critical density tracers such as\nCS(J=1-0,J=2-1) and its isotopologue counterparts, NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion\ntransitions and N2H+(J=1-0) emission, confirming the presence of dense gas\n>10^4cm^-3 in the region. The mass estimates for Core C range from 40M_{\\odot}\n(from CS(J=1-0)) to 80M_{\\odot} (from NH3 and N2H+), an order of magnitude\nsmaller than published mass estimates from CO(J=1-0) observations. We also\nmodelled the energy-dependent diffusion of cosmic-ray protons accelerated by\nRXJ1713.7-3946 into Core C, approximating the core with average density and\nmagnetic field values. We find that for considerably suppressed diffusion\ncoefficients (factors \\chi=10^{-3} down to 10^{-5} the galactic average), low\nenergy cosmic-rays can be prevented from entering the inner core region. Such\nan effect could lead to characteristic spectral behaviour in the GeV to TeV\ngamma-ray and multi-keV X-ray fluxes across the core. These features may be\nmeasurable with future gamma-ray and multi-keV telescopes offering arcminute or\nbetter angular resolution, and can be a novel way to understand the level of\ncosmic-ray acceleration in RXJ1713.7-3946 and the transport properties of\ncosmic-rays in the dense molecular cores.",

    "abstract": "We present VLA NH3 and PdBI NH2D and H13NC observations of the star forming\ncore ahead of HH 80N, the optically obscured northern counterpart of the\nHerbig-Haro objects HH 80/81. The main goal is to determine the kinematical\ninformation of the high density regions of the core ($n\\lesssim 10^5$\ncm$^{-3}$), missed in previous works due to the depletion of the species\nobserved (e.g. CS). The obtained maps show different kinematical signatures\nbetween the eastern and western parts of the core, suggesting a possible\ndynamical interaction of the core with the HH 80/81/80N outflow. The analysis\nof the Position-Velocity (PV) plots of these species rules out a previous\ninterpretation of having a molecular ring-like structure of $6\\times 10^4$ AU\nof radius traced by CS infalling onto a central protostar found in the core\n(IRS1). High degree of deuteration, with respect to the central part of the\ncore harboring IRS1, is derived in the eastern part, where a dust condensation\n(SE) is located. This deuteration trend of NH3 suggests that SE is in a\nprestellar evolutionary stage, earlier than that of the IRS1. Since SE is the\nclosest condensation to the HH 80N/81/80N outflow, in case of having\noutflow-core dynamical interaction, it should be perturbed first and be the\nmost evolved condensation in the core. Therefore, the derived evolutionary\nsequence for SE and IRS1 makes the outflow triggered star formation on IRS1\nunlikely.",

    "abstract": "We present barium, carbon, and silicon isotopic compositions of 38\nacid-cleaned presolar SiC grains from Murchison. Comparison with previous data\nshows that acid washing is highly effective in removing barium contamination.\nStrong depletions in $\\delta$($^{138}$Ba/$^{136}$Ba) values are found, down to\n$-$400 permil, which can only be modeled with a flatter $^{13}$C profile within\nthe $^{13}$C pocket than is normally used. The dependence of\n$\\delta$($^{138}$Ba/$^{136}$Ba) predictions on the distribution of $^{13}$C\nwithin the pocket in AGB models allows us to probe the $^{13}$C profile within\nthe $^{13}$C pocket and the pocket mass in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.\nIn addition, we provide constraints on the $^{22}$Ne$(\\alpha,n)^{25}$Mg rate in\nthe stellar temperature regime relevant to AGB stars, based on\n$\\delta$($^{134}$Ba/$^{136}$Ba) values of mainstream grains. We found two\nnominally mainstream grains with strongly negative\n$\\delta$($^{134}$Ba/$^{136}$Ba) values that cannot be explained by any of the\ncurrent AGB model calculations. Instead, such negative values are consistent\nwith the intermediate neutron capture process ($i$-process), which is activated\nby the Very Late Thermal Pulse (VLTP) during the post-AGB phase and\ncharacterized by a neutron density much higher than the $s$-process. These two\ngrains may have condensed around post-AGB stars. Finally, we report abundances\nof two $p$-process isotopes, $^{130}$Ba and $^{132}$Ba, in single SiC grains.\nThese isotopes are destroyed in the $s$-process in AGB stars. By comparing\ntheir abundances with respect to that of $^{135}$Ba, we conclude that there is\nno measurable decay of $^{135}$Cs ($t_{1/2}$= 2.3 Ma) to $^{135}$Ba in\nindividual SiC grains, indicating condensation of barium, but not cesium into\nSiC grains before $^{135}$Cs decayed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Repeated brain MRI scans are performed in many clinical scenarios,\nsuch as follow up of patients with tumors and therapy response assessment. In\nthis paper, the authors show an approach to utilize former scans of the patient\nfor the acceleration of repeated MRI scans.\n  Methods: The proposed approach utilizes the possible similarity of the\nrepeated scans in longitudinal MRI studies. Since similarity is not guaranteed,\nsampling and reconstruction are adjusted during acquisition to match the actual\nsimilarity between the scans. The baseline MR scan is utilized both in the\nsampling stage, via adaptive sampling, and in the reconstruction stage, with\nweighted reconstruction. In adaptive sampling, k-space sampling locations are\noptimized during acquisition. Weighted reconstruction uses the locations of the\nnonzero coefficients in the sparse domains as a prior in the recovery process.\nThe approach was tested on 2D and 3D MRI scans of patients with brain tumors.\n  Results: The longitudinal adaptive CS MRI (LACS-MRI) scheme provides\nreconstruction quality which outperforms other CS-based approaches for rapid\nMRI. Examples are shown on patients with brain tumors and demonstrate improved\nspatial resolution. Compared with data sampled at Nyquist rate, LACS-MRI\nexhibits Signal-to-Error Ratio (SER) of 24.8dB with undersampling factor of\n16.6 in 3D MRI.\n  Conclusions: The authors have presented a novel method for image\nreconstruction utilizing similarity of scans in longitudinal MRI studies, where\npossible.

Determination of stellar\nparameters and element abundances was based on analysis of high-quality\nVLT/UVES spectra. The surface gravity was calculated from the NLTE ionisation\nbalance between Fe I and Fe II. Accurate abundances were determined for a total\nof 38 elements, including 22 neutron-capture elements beyond Sr and up to Th.\nThis object is deficient in carbon, as expected for a giant star with Teff <\n4800 K. The stellar Na-Zn abundances are well fitted by the yields of a single\nsupernova of 14.4 Msun. For the neutron-capture elements in the Sr-Ru, Ba-Yb,\nand Os-Ir regions, the abundance pattern of HE 2252-4225 is in excellent\nagreement with the average abundance pattern of the strongly r-process enhanced\nstars CS 22892-052, CS 31082-001, HE 1219-0312, and HE 1523-091.

Aims: We wish to\nexploit the unmatched combination of high angular resolution, high sensitivity,\nhigh-imaging fidelity, and spectral coverage provided by ALMA to shed light on\nthe complex kinematics of the innermost central regions of HH212. Methods: We\nmapped the inner 10\" (4500 AU) of the HH212 system at about 0.5 arcsec\nresolution in several molecular tracers and in the 850 $\\mu$m dust continuum\nusing the ALMA interferometer in band 7 in the extended configuration of the\nEarly Science Cycle 0 operations. Results: Within a single ALMA spectral\nset-up, we simultaneously identify all the crucial ingredients known to be\ninvolved in the star formation recipe namely: (i) the fast, collimated bipolar\nSiO jet driven by the protostar, (ii) the large-scale swept-up CO outflow,\n(iii) the flattened rotating and infalling envelope, with bipolar cavities\ncarved by the outflow (in C$^{17}$O(3--2)), and (iv) a rotating wide-angle flow\nthat fills the cavities and surrounding the axial jet (in C$^{34}$S(7--6)).

The rotating disk is possibly Keplerian.\nConclusions: HH212 is the third Class 0 protostar with possible signatures of a\nKeplerian disk of radius $\\geq 30 AU$. The warped geometry in our CS data\nsuggests that this large keplerian disk might result from misaligned magnetic\nand rotation axes during the collapse phase.

    "abstract": "This paper makes several important contributions to the literature about\nnonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) estimation and inference on a\nstructural function $h_0$ and its functionals. First, we derive sup-norm\nconvergence rates for computationally simple sieve NPIV (series 2SLS)\nestimators of $h_0$ and its derivatives. Second, we derive a lower bound that\ndescribes the best possible (minimax) sup-norm rates of estimating $h_0$ and\nits derivatives, and show that the sieve NPIV estimator can attain the minimax\nrates when $h_0$ is approximated via a spline or wavelet sieve. Our optimal\nsup-norm rates surprisingly coincide with the optimal root-mean-squared rates\nfor severely ill-posed problems, and are only a logarithmic factor slower than\nthe optimal root-mean-squared rates for mildly ill-posed problems. Third, we\nuse our sup-norm rates to establish the uniform Gaussian process strong\napproximations and the score bootstrap uniform confidence bands (UCBs) for\ncollections of nonlinear functionals of $h_0$ under primitive conditions,\nallowing for mildly and severely ill-posed problems. Fourth, as applications,\nwe obtain the first asymptotic pointwise and uniform inference results for\nplug-in sieve t-statistics of exact consumer surplus (CS) and deadweight loss\n(DL) welfare functionals under low-level conditions when demand is estimated\nvia sieve NPIV.

Using ASTE we\nmapped a 2.4' $\\times$ 2.4' region towards the molecular cloud N159-W in the\n$^{13}$CO J=3-2 line and observed several molecular lines at an IR peak very\nclose to a massive young stellar object. $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO J=3-2 were\nobserved towards two positions in N166 and one position in N132. The $^{13}$CO\nJ=3-2 map of the N159-W cloud shows that the molecular peak is shifted\nsouthwest compared to the peak of the IR emission. Towards the IR peak we\ndetected emission from HCN, HNC, HCO$^{+}$, C$_{2}$H J=4-3, CS J=7-6, and\ntentatively C$^{18}$O J=3-2. This is the first reported detection of these\nmolecular lines in N159-W. The analysis of the C$_{2}$H line yields more\nevidence supporting that the chemistry involving this molecular species in\ncompact and/or UCHII regions in the LMC should be similar to that in Galactic\nones. A non-LTE study of the CO emission suggests the presence of both cool and\nwarm gas in the analysed region. The same analysis for the CS, HCO$^{+}$, HCN,\nand HNC shows that it is very likely that their emissions arise mainly from\nwarm gas with a density between $5 \\times 10^5$ to some $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. The\nobtained HCN/HNC abundance ratio greater than 1 is compatible with warm gas and\nwith an star-forming scenario.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a low-complexity channel estimation (CE) scheme based on\ncompressive sensing (CS) for time-domain synchronous (TDS) orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to overcome the performance loss under\ndoubly selective fading channels. Specifically, an overlap-add method of the\ntime-domain training sequence is first proposed to obtain the coarse estimates\nof the channel length, path delays and path gains of the wireless channel, by\nexploiting the channel's temporal correlation to improve the robustness of the\ncoarse CE under the severe fading channel with long delay spread. We then\npropose the priori-information aided (PA) iterative hard threshold (IHT)\nalgorithm, which utilizes the priori information of the acquired coarse\nestimate for the wireless channel and therefore is capable of obtaining an\naccurate channel estimate of the doubly selective fading channel. Compared with\nthe classical IHT algorithm whose convergence requires the $l_2$ norm of the\nmeasurement matrix being less than 1, the proposed PA-IHT algorithm exploits\nthe priori information acquired to remove such a limitation as well as to\nreduce the number of required iterations. Compared with the existing CS based\nCE method for TDS-OFDM, the proposed PA-IHT algorithm significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity of CE as well as enhances the CE accuracy. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that, without sacrificing spectral efficiency and changing\nthe current TDS-OFDM signal structure, the proposed scheme performs better than\nthe existing CE schemes for TDS-OFDM in various scenarios, especially under\nseverely doubly selective fading channels.",

    "title": "Probing gas and dust in the tidal tail of NGC 5221 with the type Ia\n  supernova iPTF16abc",
    "abstract": "Context. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to address numerous\nquestions in astrophysics and cosmology. Due to their well known spectral and\nphotometric properties, SNe Ia are well suited to study gas and dust along the\nlines-of-sight to the explosions. For example, narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K\nabsorption lines can be studied easily, because of the well-defined spectral\ncontinuum of SNe Ia around these features. Aims. We study the gas and dust\nalong the line-of-sight to iPTF16abc, which occurred in an unusual location, in\na tidal arm, 80 kpc from centre of the galaxy NGC 5221. Methods. Using a\ntime-series of high-resolution spectra, we examine narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K\nabsorption features for variations in time, which would be indicative for\ncircumstellar (CS) matter. Furthermore, we take advantage of the well known\nphotometric properties of SNe Ia to determine reddening due to dust along the\nline-of-sight. Results. From the lack of variations in Na I D and Ca II H&K, we\ndetermine that none of the detected absorption features originate from the CS\nmedium of iPTF16abc. While the Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption is found to be\noptically thick, a negligible amount of reddening points to a small column of\ninterstellar dust. Conclusions. We find that the gas along the line-of-sight to\niPTF16abc is typical of what might be found in the interstellar medium (ISM)\nwithin a galaxy. It suggests that we are observing gas that has been tidally\nstripped during an interaction of NGC 5221 with one of its neighbouring\ngalaxies in the past $\\sim10^9$ years. In the future, the gas clouds could\nbecome the locations of star formation. On a longer time scale, the clouds\nmight diffuse, enriching the circum-galactic medium (CGM) with metals. The gas\nprofile along the line-of-sight should be useful for future studies of the\ndynamics of the galaxy group containing NGC 5221.",

    "abstract": "The time-independent projection-operator formalism of Brey et al. [Physica\n109A, 425-444 (1981)] for the derivation of Burnett equations is extended and\nconsidered in the context of multispecies and magnetized plasmas. The procedure\nprovides specific formulas for the transport coefficients in terms of two-time\ncorrelation functions involving both two and three phase-space points. It is\nshown how to calculate those correlation functions in the limit of weak\ncoupling. The results are used to demonstrate, with the aid of a particular\nnontrivial example, that previously derived formulas from the two-time\nformalism [J. J. Brey, J. Chem. Phys. 79, 4585-598 (1983)] are consistent with\nthe Chapman-Enskog methodology employed later by Catto & Simakov (CS) [Phys.\nPlasmas 11, 90-102 (2004)] for the contributions to the parallel viscosity\ndriven by temperature gradients. The work serves to unify various previous work\non plasma kinetic theory with formalism usually applied to turbulence theory.\nAdditional contributions include discussions of (i) Braginskii-order\ninterspecies momentum exchange from the point of view of two-time correlations;\nand (ii) a simple stochastic model, unrelated to many-body theory, that\nexhibits Burnett effects. Insights from that model emphasize the role of\nnon-Gaussian statistics in the evaluation of Burnett transport coefficients,\nincluding the effects calculated by CS that stem from the nonlinear collision\noperator. Together, Parts I and II of this series provide a tutorial\nintroduction to projection-operator methods that should be broadly useful in\ntheoretical plasma physics. A Supplement (bundled at the end of Part II)\nprovides some technical details of the reduction of the general Burnett\nequations of Brey et al. (1981) to a one-component neutral fluid in order to\nsupport the result quoted by Brey (1983).",

    "abstract": "We compare multi-epoch sub-arcsecond VLA imaging of the 22 GHz water masers\ntoward the massive protocluster NGC6334I observed before and after the recent\noutburst of MM1B in (sub)millimeter continuum. Since the outburst, the water\nmaser emission toward MM1 has substantially weakened. Simultaneously, the\nstrong water masers associated with the synchrotron continuum point source CM2\nhave flared by a mean factor of 6.5 (to 4.2 kJy) with highly-blueshifted\nfeatures (up to 70 km/s from LSR) becoming more prominent. The strongest\nflaring water masers reside 3000 au north of MM1B and form a remarkable bow\nshock pattern whose vertex coincides with CM2 and tail points back to MM1B.\nExcited OH masers trace a secondary bow shock located ~120 au downstream. ALMA\nimages of CS (6-5) reveal a highly-collimated north-south structure\nencompassing the flaring masers to the north and the non-flaring masers to the\nsouth seen in projection toward the MM3-UCHII region. Proper motions of the\nsouthern water masers over 5.3 years indicate a bulk projected motion of 117\nkm/s southward from MM1B with a dynamical time of 170 yr. We conclude that CM2,\nthe water masers, and many of the excited OH masers trace the interaction of\nthe high velocity bipolar outflow from MM1B with ambient molecular gas. The\npreviously-excavated outflow cavity has apparently allowed the radiative energy\nof the current outburst to propagate freely until terminating at the northern\nbow shock where it strengthened the masers. Additionally, water masers have\nbeen detected toward MM7 for the first time, and a highly-collimated CS (6-5)\noutflow has been detected toward MM4.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of quasi-one-dimensional Chromium-based\nsuperconductivity has generated much excitement. We study in this work the\nsuperconducting instabilities of a representative compound, the newly\nsynthesized KCr$_3$As$_3$ superconductor. Based on inputs from density\nfunctional theory calculations, we first construct an effective multi-orbital\ntight-binding Hamiltonian to model its low-energy band structure. We then\nemploy standard random-phase approximation calculations to investigate the\nsuperconducting instabilities of the resultant multi-orbital Hubbard model. We\nfind various pairing symmetries in the phase diagram in different interaction\nparameter regimes, including the triplet $f$-wave, $p_z$-wave and singlet\n$s^\\pm$-wave pairings. We argue that the singlet $s^\\pm$-wave pairing, which\nemerges at intermediate interaction strength, is realized in this material.\nThis singlet pairing is driven by spin-density wave fluctuations enhanced by\nFermi-surface nesting. We point out that phase-sensitive measurement can\ndistinguish the $s$-wave pairing in KCr$_3$As$_3$ from the $p_z$-wave\npreviously proposed for a related compound K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$. The\n$s^{\\pm}$-wave pairing in KCr$_3$As$_3$ shall also exhibit a subgap spin\nresonance mode near the nesting vector, which can be tested by inelastic\nneutron scattering measurements. Another intriguing property of the\n$s^\\pm$-pairing is that it can induce time-reversal invariant topological\nsuperconductivity in a semiconductor wire with large Rashba spin-orbit coupling\nvia proximity effect. Our study shall be of general relevance to all\nsuperconductors in the family of ACr$_3$As$_3$ (A=K, Rb, Cs).",

    "title": "The Serpens filament: at the onset of slightly supercritical collapse",
    "abstract": "The Serpens filament, as one of the nearest infrared dark clouds, is regarded\nas a pristine filament at a very early evolutionary stage of star formation. In\norder to study its molecular content and dynamical state, we mapped this\nfilament in seven species. Among them, HCO$^{+}$, HNC, HCN, and CS show\nself-absorption, while C$^{18}$O is most sensitive to the filamentary\nstructure. A kinematic analysis demonstrates that this filament forms a\nvelocity-coherent (trans-)sonic structure, a large part of which is one of the\nmost quiescent regions in the Serpens cloud. Widespread C$^{18}$O depletion is\nfound throughout the Serpens filament. Based on the Herschel dust-derived\nH$_{2}$ column density map, the line mass of the filament is\n36--41~M$_{\\odot}$~pc$^{-1}$, and its full width at half maximum is\n0.17$\\pm$0.01~pc, while its length is ~1.6~pc. The inner radial column density\nprofile of this filament can be well fitted with a Plummer profile with an\nexponent of 2.2$\\pm$0.1, a scale radius of $0.018\\pm 0.003$ pc, and a central\ndensity of $(4.0\\pm 0.8)\\times 10^{4}$~cm$^{-3}$. The Serpens filament appears\nto be slightly supercritical. The widespread blue-skewed HNC and CS line\nprofiles and HCN hyperfine line anomalies across this filament indicate radial\ninfall in parts of the Serpens filament. C$^{18}$O velocity gradients also\nindicate accretion flows along the filament. The velocity and density\nstructures suggest that such accretion flows are likely due to a longitudinal\ncollapse parallel to the filament's long axis. Both the radial infall rate and\nthe longitudinal accretion rate along the Serpens filament are lower than all\npreviously reported values in other filaments. This indicates that the Serpens\nfilament lies at an early evolutionary stage when collapse has just begun, or\nthat thermal and non-thermal support are effective in providing support against\ngravity.",

Thus, a survey and study of lines at the 345 GHz window is required\nin order to have a more complete understanding of the chemistry and excitation\nconditions of the region.

    "title": "Robust Bayesian compressive sensing for signals in structural health\n  monitoring",
    "abstract": "In structural health monitoring (SHM) systems, massive amounts of data are\noften generated that need data compression techniques to reduce the cost of\nsignal transfer and storage. Compressive sensing (CS) is a novel data\nacquisition method whereby the compression is done in a sensor simultaneously\nwith the sampling. If the original sensed signal is sufficiently sparse in\nterms of some basis, the decompression can be done essentially perfectly up to\nsome critical compression ratio. In this article, a Bayesian compressive\nsensing (BCS) method is investigated that uses sparse Bayesian learning to\nreconstruct signals from a compressive sensor. By explicitly quantifying the\nuncertainty in the reconstructed signal, the BCS technique exhibits an obvious\nbenefit over existing regularized norm-minimization CS methods that provide a\nsingle signal estimate. However, current BCS algorithms suffer from a\nrobustness problem: sometimes the reconstruction errors are very large when the\nnumber of measurements is a lot less than the number of signal degrees of\nfreedom that are needed to capture the signal accurately in a directly sampled\nform. In this paper, we present improvements to the BCS reconstruction method\nto enhance its robustness so that even higher compression ratios can be used\nand we examine the tradeoff between efficiently compressing data and accurately\ndecompressing it. Synthetic data and actual acceleration data collected from a\nbridge SHM system are used as examples. Compared with the state-of-the-art BCS\nreconstruction algorithms, the improved BCS algorithm demonstrates superior\nperformance. With the same reconstruction error, the proposed BCS algorithm\nworks with relatively large compression ratios and it can achieve perfect\nlossless compression performance with quite high compression ratios.\nFurthermore, the error bars for the signal reconstruction are also quantified\neffectively.",

Determining line\nparameters and optical depths and performing Large Velocity Gradient radiative\ntransfer calculations, the aims of this study are (1) to evaluate physical\nparameters of the absorbing foreground gas at z~0.89, in particular its\nhomogeneity, and (2) to monitor the spectroscopic time variability caused by\nfluctuations of the z~2.5 background continuum source. We find, that the gas is\nquite inhomogeneous with n(H2)~2 x 10^3 cm^-3 for most molecular species but\nwith higher values for H2CO and lower ones for SO. Measuring the CS J=1-0\ntransition during a time interval of more than a decade, from 2001 to 2012, the\npeak absorption depth of the line remains approximately constant, while the\nline shape undergoes notable variations. Covering the time between 1996 and\n2013, CS, HCO+, and CH3OH data indicate maximal integrated optical depths in\n~2001 and 2011/2012. This is compatible with a ~10 yr periodicity, which,\nhowever, needs confirmation by substantially longer time monitoring. Comparing\nmolecular abundances with those of different types of Galactic and nearby\nextragalactic clouds we find that the observed cloud complex does not\ncorrespond to one particular type but to a variety of cloud types with more\ndiffuse and denser components as can be expected for an observed region with a\ntransverse linear scale of several parsec and a likely larger depth along the\nline-of-sight.

The bright sources in the\ncenter show spectral indices around -0.1 implying Bremsstrahlung emission,\nwhile dust emission is emerging in the minispiral exterior. Apart from CS,\nwhich is most widespread in the center, H13CO+, HC3N, SiO, SO, C2H, CH3OH, 13CS\nand N2H+ are also detected. The bulk of the clumpy emission regions is at\npositive velocities and in a region confined by the minispiral northern arm,\nbar and the sources IRS 3 and 7. Although partly spatially overlapping with the\nradio recombination line (RRL) emission at same negative velocities, the\nrelation to the minispiral remains unclear. A likely explanation is an\ninfalling clump consisting of denser cloud cores embedded in diffuse gas. The\ncentral association of clouds (CA) shows three times higher CS/X (X: any other\nobserved molecule) ratios than the circumnuclear disk (CND) suggesting a\ncombination of higher excitation, by a temperature gradient and/or IR-pumping,\nand abundance enhancement due to UV- and/or X-ray emission. Hence, we conclude\nthat this CA is closer to the center than the CND is to the center. Moreover,\nwe find molecular emission at velocities up to 200 km s-1. ...",

We attempt to derive physical parameters\nfor BHR 160 and to understand its structure and the origin of its peculiar\nbright rim. BHR 160 was mapped in the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (2-1)\nand (1-0) and CS (3-2) and (2-1) lines. These data, augmented with stellar\nphotometry derived from the ESO VVV survey, were used to derive the mass and\ndistribution of molecular material in BHR 160 and its surroundings. Archival\nmid-infrared data from the WISE satellite was used to find IR excess stars in\nthe globule and its neighbourhood. An elongated 1' by 0.6' core lies adjacent\nto the globule bright rim. $^{12}$CO emission covers the whole globule, but the\n$^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O and CS emission is more concentrated to the core. The\n$^{12}$CO line profiles indicate the presence of outflowing material near the\ncore, but the spatial resolution of the mm data is not sufficient for a\ndetailed spatial analysis. The BHR 160 mass estimated from the C$^{18}$O\nmapping is 100$\\pm$50Msun(d/1.6kpc)$^2$ where d is the distance to the globule.\nApproximately 70 percent of the mass lies in the dense core. The total mass of\nmolecular gas in the direction of BHR 160 is 210$\\pm$(d/1.6kpc)$^2$ Msun when\nestimated from the more extended VVV NIR photometry. We argue that the bright\nrim of BHR 160 is produced by a close-by early B-type star, HD 319648, that was\nlikely recently born in the globule. This star is likely to have triggered the\nformation of a source, IRS 1, that is embedded within the core of the globule\nand detected only in Ks and by WISE and IRAS.",

We use the IRAM 30m telescope and the PdBI to study\nthe chemical and physical properties of the starless core FeSt 1-457 (Core\n109), in the Pipe nebula. We fit the hyperfine structure of the N2H+(1-0) IRAM\n30m data.

We use a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere model adding a temperature\ngradient towards the center to fit the 1.2 mm continuum emission and visual\nextinction maps. Using this model, we estimate the abundances of the N2H+ and\nthe rest of molecular lines detected in the 30 GHz wide line survey performed\nat 3 mm with IRAM 30m using ARTIST software. The core presents a rich chemistry\nwith emission from early (C3H2, HCN, CS) and late-time molecules (e.g., N2H+),\nwith a clear chemical spatial differentiation for nitrogen, oxygen and\nsulphurated molecules. For most of the molecules detected (HCN, HCO+, CH3OH,\nCS, SO, 13CO and C18O), abundances are best fitted with three values,\npresenting a clear decrease of abundance of at least 1 or 2 orders of magnitude\ntowards the center of the core. The Bonnor-Ebert analysis indicates the core is\ngravitationally unstable and the magnetic field is not strong enough to avoid\nthe collapse. Depletion of molecules onto the dust grains occurs at the\ninterior of the core, where dust grain growth and dust depolarization also\noccurs. This suggests that these properties may be related. On the other hand,\nsome molecules exhibit asymmetries in their integrated emission maps, which\nappear to be correlated with a previously reported submillimetre polarization\nasymmetry.

We present a method based on the tomographic study\nof an edge-on disk. Using ALMA, we observe at 0.5$\"$ resolution the Flying\nSaucer in CO J=2-1 and CS J=5-4. This edge-on disk appears in silhouette\nagainst the CO J=2-1 emission from background molecular clouds in $\\rho$ Oph.\nThe combination of velocity gradients due to the Keplerian rotation of the disk\nand intensity variations in the CO background as a function of velocity provide\na direct measure of the gas temperature as a function of radius and height\nabove the disk mid-plane. The overall thermal structure is consistent with\nmodel predictions, with a cold ($< 15-12 $~K), CO-depleted mid-plane, and a\nwarmer disk atmosphere. However, we find evidence for CO gas along the\nmid-plane beyond a radius of about 200\\,au, coincident with a change of grain\nproperties. Such a behavior is expected in case of efficient rise of UV\npenetration re-heating the disk and thus allowing CO thermal desorption or\nfavoring direct CO photo-desorption.

In a variety of recently developed sub-Doppler laser\nspectroscopy techniques for gases one-dimensionally confined in a thin cell,\nthe specific contribution of atoms moving nearly parallel to the boundary of\nthe vapor container becomes essential. We report here on the implementation of\nan experiment to probe effectively the distribution of atomic velocities\nparallel to the windows for a thin (60 microns) Cs vapor cell. The principle of\nthe set-up relies on a spatially separated pump-probe experiment, where the\nvariations of the signal amplitude with the pump-probe separation provide the\ninformation on the velocity distribution. The experiment is performed in a\nsapphire cell on the Cs resonance line, which benefits of a long-lived\nhyperfine optical pumping. Presently, we can analyze specifically the density\nof atoms with slow normal velocities ~ 5-20 m/s, already corresponding to\nunusual grazing flight theta at ~85{\\deg}-88.5{\\deg} from the normal to the\nsurface and no deviation from the M-B law is found within the limits of our\nelementary set-up.

Sub-Nyquist radars exploit the fact that the\ntarget scene is sparse facilitating the use of compressed sensing (CS) methods\nin signal recovery. In this chapter, we review several pulse-Doppler radar\nsystems based on these principles.

This paves the\nway to cognitive radars which share their transmit spectrum with other\ncommunication services, thereby providing a robust solution for coexistence in\nspectrally crowded environments. Next, without impairing Doppler resolution, we\nreduce the dwell time by transmitting interleaved radar pulses in a scarce\nmanner within a coherent processing interval or \"slow time\".

In analogy with the standard theory of accretion discs, our theory is\nbased on shear viscous forces among nested annuli of gas.

Our theory allows us to approximately predict the size of the ring\ngiven the underlying gravitational potential. The size of the ring is loosely\nrelated to the location of the Inner Lindblad Resonance in the epicyclic\napproximation, but the predicted location is more accurate and is also valid\nfor strongly barred potentials. By comparing analytical predictions with the\nresults of hydrodynamical simulations, we find that our theory provides a\nviable mechanism for ring formation if the effective sound speed of the gas is\nlow ($\\cs\\lesssim1\\kms$), but that nuclear spirals/shocks created by pressure\ndestroy the ring when the sound speed is high ($\\cs\\simeq10\\kms$). We conclude\nthat whether this mechanism for ring formation is relevant for real galaxies\nultimately depends on the effective equation of state of the ISM. Promising\nconfirmation comes from simulations in which the ISM is modelled using\nstate-of-the-art cooling functions coupled to live chemical networks, but more\ntests are needed regarding the role of turbulence driven by stellar feedback.\nIf the mechanism is relevant in real galaxies, it could provide a powerful tool\nto constrain the gravitational potential, in particular the bar pattern speed.",

When compared\nto other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed deep cascaded CNN method and\nits stochastic variation demonstrated significant improvements. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first study using deep CNN based CS for the DT-CMR\nreconstruction. In addition, with relatively straightforward modifications to\nthe acquisition scheme, our method can easily be translated into a method for\nonline, at-the-scanner reconstruction enabling the deployment of accelerated\nDT-CMR in various clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Studying molecular species in protoplanetary disks is very useful to\ncharacterize the properties of these objects, which are the site of planet\nformation. We attempt to constrain the chemistry of S-bearing molecules in the\ncold parts of circumstellar disk of GG Tau A. We searched for H$_2$S, CS, SO,\nand SO$_2$ in the dense disk around GG Tau A with the NOrthem Extended\nMillimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer. We detected H$_2$S emission from the\ndense and cold ring orbiting around GG Tau A. This is the first detection of\nH$_2$S in a protoplanetary disk. We also detected HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, and\nDCO$^+$ in the disk. Upper limits for other molecules, CCS, SO$_2$, SO,\nHC$_3$N, and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ are also obtained. The observed DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$\nratio is similar to those in other disks. The observed column densities,\nderived using our radiative transfer code DiskFit, are then compared with those\nfrom our chemical code Nautilus. The column densities are in reasonable\nagreement for DCO$^{+}$, CS, CCS, and SO$_2$. For H$_2$S and SO, our predicted\nvertical integrated column densities are more than a factor of 10 higher than\nthe measured values. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that only a strong\nsulfur depletion may explain the low observed H$_2$S column density in the\ndisk. The H$_2$S detection in GG Tau A is most likely linked to the much larger\nmass of this disk compared to that in other T Tauri systems.",

    "abstract": "It has been conjectured that Chern-Simons (CS) gauged `regular' bosons in the\nfundamental representation are `level-rank' dual to CS gauged critical fermions\nalso in the fundamental representation. Generic relevant deformations of these\nconformal field theories lead to one of two distinct massive phases. In\nprevious work, the large $N$ thermal free energy for the bosonic theory in the\nunHiggsed phase has been demonstrated to match the corresponding fermionic\nresults under duality. In this note we evaluate the large $N$ thermal free\nenergy of the bosonic theory in the Higgsed phase and demonstrate that our\nresults, again, perfectly match the predictions of duality. Our computation is\nperformed in a unitary gauge by integrating out the physical excitations of the\ntheory - i.e. W bosons - at all orders in the 't Hooft coupling. Our results\nallow us to construct an exact quantum effective potential for ${\\bar \\phi}\n\\phi$, the lightest gauge invariant scalar operator in the theory. In the zero\ntemperature limit this exact Landau-Ginzburg potential is non-analytic at\n${\\bar \\phi \\phi}=0$. The extrema of this effective potential at positive\n${\\bar \\phi}\\phi$ solve the gap equations in the Higgsed phase while the\nextrema at negative ${\\bar \\phi} \\phi$ solve the gap equations in the unHiggsed\nphase. Our effective potential is bounded from below only for a certain range\nof $x_6$ (the parameter that governs sextic interactions of $\\phi$).

Here we report the discovery of a rigid dichotomy in\ncircumstellar (CS) environments around two subclasses of type Ia supernovae\n(SNe Ia) as defined by their distinct photospheric velocities. For the SNe Ia\nwith high photospheric velocities (HV), we found a significant excess flux in\nblue light during 60-100 days past maximum, while this phenomenon is absent for\nSNe with normal photospheric velocity (Normal). This blue excess can be\nattributed to light echoes by circumstellar dust located at a distance of about\n1-3x10^{17} cm from the HV subclass. Moreover, we also found that the HV SNe Ia\nshow systematically evolving Na I absorption line by performing a systematic\nsearch of variable Na I absorption lines in spectra of all SNe Ia, whereas this\nevolution is rarely seen in Normal ones. The evolving Na I absorption can be\nmodeled in terms of photoionization model, with the location of the gas clouds\nat a distance of about 2x10^{17} cm, in striking agreement with the location of\nCS dust inferred from B-band light curve excess.

    "abstract": "Nonlocal compensation of magnetic damping by spin injection has been\ntheoretically shown to establish dynamic, noncollinear magnetization states\nthat carry spin currents over micrometer distances. Such states can be\ngenerically referred to as dissipative exchange flows (DEFs) because spatially\ndiffusing spin currents are established by the mutual exchange torque exerted\nby neighboring spins. Analytical studies to date have been limited to the weak\nspin injection assumption whereby the equation of motion for the magnetization\nis mapped to hydrodynamic equations describing spin flow and then linearized.\nHere, we analytically and numerically study easy-plane ferromagnetic channels\nsubject to spin injection of arbitrary strength at one extremum under a unified\nhydrodynamic framework. We find that DEFs generally exhibit a nonlinear profile\nalong the channel accompanied by a nonlinear frequency tuneability. At large\ninjection strengths, we fully characterize a novel magnetization state we call\na contact-soliton DEF (CS-DEF) composed of a stationary soliton at the\ninjection site, which smoothly transitions into a DEF and exhibits a negative\nfrequency tuneability. The transition between a DEF and a CS-DEF occurs at the\nmaximum precessional frequency and coincides with the Landau criterion: a\nsubsonic to supersonic flow transition. Leveraging the hydraulic-electrical\nanalogy, the current-voltage characteristics of a nonlinear DEF circuit are\npresented. Micromagnetic simulations of nanowires that include\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy and non-local dipole fields are in qualitative\nagreement with the analytical results. The magnetization states found here\nalong with their characteristic profile and spectral features provide\nquantitative guidelines to pursue an experimental demonstration of DEFs in\nferromagnetic materials and establishes a unified description for long-distance\nspin transport.",

Starting from sparsity, recovery methods\nhave steadily moved towards more complex structures. Emerging machine learning\ntools such as generative functions that are based on neural networks are able\nto learn general complex structures from training data. This makes them\npotentially powerful tools for designing CS algorithms. Consider a desired\nclass of signals $\\cal Q$, ${\\cal Q}\\subset{R}^n$, and a corresponding\ngenerative function $g:{\\cal U}^k\\rightarrow {R}^n$, ${\\cal U}\\subset {R}$,\nsuch that $\\sup_{{\\bf x}\\in {\\cal Q}}\\min_{{\\bf u}\\in{\\cal U}^k}{1\\over\n\\sqrt{n}}\\|g({\\bf u})-{\\bf x}\\|\\leq \\delta$. A recovery method based on $g$\nseeks $g({\\bf u})$ with minimum measurement error. In this paper, the\nperformance of such a recovery method is studied, under both noisy and\nnoiseless measurements. In the noiseless case, roughly speaking, it is proven\nthat, as $k$ and $n$ grow without bound and $\\delta$ converges to zero, if the\nnumber of measurements ($m$) is larger than the input dimension of the\ngenerative model ($k$), then asymptotically, almost lossless recovery is\npossible.

The\nauto-encoder is defined by encoder and decoder (generative) functions\n$f:{R}^n\\to{\\cal U}^k$ and $g:{\\cal U}^k\\to{R}^n$, respectively. We\ntheoretically prove that, roughly, given $m>40k\\log{1\\over \\delta}$\nmeasurements, such an algorithm converges to the vicinity of the desired\nresult, even in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise.

Our goal is to complete the inventory of S-bearing molecules and their\nabundances in the prototypical photodissociation region (PDR) the Horsehead\nnebula to gain insight into sulphur chemistry in UV irradiated regions. Based\non the WHISPER millimeter (mm) line survey, our goal is to provide an improved\nand more accurate description of sulphur species and their abundances towards\nthe core and PDR positions in the Horsehead.\n  Methods. The Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) methodology and the molecular\nexcitation and radiative transfer code RADEX were used to explore the parameter\nspace and determine physical conditions and beam-averaged molecular abundances.\n  Results. A total of 13 S-bearing species (CS, SO, SO2, OCS, H2CS - both ortho\nand para - HDCS, C2S, HCS+, SO+, H2S, S2H, NS and NS+) have been detected in\nthe two targeted positions. This is the first detection of SO+ in the Horsehead\nand the first detection of NS+ in any PDR. We find a differentiated chemical\nbehaviour between C-S and O-S bearing species within the nebula. The C-S\nbearing species C2S and o-H2CS present fractional abundances a factor grater\nthan two higher in the core than in the PDR. In contrast, the O-S bearing\nmolecules SO, SO2, and OCS present similar abundances towards both positions. A\nfew molecules, SO+, NS, and NS+, are more abundant towards the PDR than towards\nthe core, and could be considered as PDR tracers.\n  Conclusions. This is the first complete study of S-bearing species towards a\nPDR. Our study shows that CS, SO, and H2S are the most abundant S-bearing\nmolecules in the PDR with abundances of a few 1E-9.

    "abstract": "Prompt double-$J/\\psi$ production at high-energy hadron colliders can be\nconsidered as a golden channel to probe double parton scatterings (DPS) --in\nparticular to study gluon-gluon correlations inside the proton-- and, at the\nsame time, to measure the distribution of linearly-polarised gluons inside the\nproton. Such studies however require a good control of both single and DPS in\nthe respective regions where they are carried out. In this context, we have\ncritically examined two mechanisms of single parton scatterings (SPS) that may\nbe kinematically enhanced where DPS are thought to be dominant, even though\nthey are either at higher orders in the strong-coupling or velocity expansion.\nFirst, we have considered a gauge-invariant and infrared-safe subset of the\nloop-induced contribution via Colour-Singlet (CS) transitions. We have found it\nto become the leading CS SPS contributions at large rapidity separation, yet\ntoo small to account for the data without invoking the presence of DPS yields.\nSecond, we have surveyed the possible Colour-Octet (CO) contributions using\nboth old and up-to-date non-perturbative long distance matrix elements (LDMEs).\nWe have found that the pure CO yields crucially depend on the LDMEs. Among all\nthe LDMEs we used, only two result into a visible modification of the NRQCD\n(CS+CO) yield, but only in two kinematical distributions measured by ATLAS,\nthose of the rapidity separation and of the pair invariant mass. These\nmodifications however do not impact the control region used for their DPS\nstudy.",

    "abstract": "There is a sharp disconnect between the programming and mathematical portions\nof the standard undergraduate computer science curriculum, leading to student\nmisunderstanding about how the two are related. We propose connecting the\nsubjects early in the curriculum---specifically, in CS1 and the introductory\ndiscrete mathematics course---by using formal reasoning about programs as a\nbridge between them.\n  This article reports on Haverford and Grinnell College's experience in\nconstructing the end points of this bridge between CS1 and discrete\nmathematics. Haverford's long-standing \"3-2-1\" curriculum introduces code\nreasoning in conjunction with introductory programming concepts, and Grinnell's\ndiscrete mathematics introduces code reasoning as a motivation for logic and\nformal deduction. Both courses present code reasoning in a style based on\nsymbolic code execution techniques from the programming language community, but\ntuned to address the particulars of each course.\n  These courses rely primarily on traditional means of proof authoring with\npen-and-paper. This is unsatisfactory for students who receive no feedback\nuntil grading on their work and instructors who must shoulder the burden of\ninterpreting students' proofs and giving useful feedback. To this end, we also\ndescribe the current state of Orca, an in-development proof assistant for\nundergraduate education that we are developing to address these issues in our\ncourses.\n  Finally, in teaching our courses, we have discovered a number of educational\nresearch questions about the effectiveness of code reasoning in bridging the\ngap between programming and mathematics, and the ability of tools like \\orca to\nsupport this pedagogy. We pose these research questions as next steps to\nformalize our initial experiences in our courses with the hope of eventually\ngeneralizing our approaches for wider adoption.",

    "abstract": "In compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI), k-space measurements are under-sampled to\nachieve accelerated scan times. CS-MRI presents two fundamental problems: (1)\nwhere to sample and (2) how to reconstruct an under-sampled scan. In this\npaper, we tackle both problems simultaneously for the specific case of 2D\nCartesian sampling, using a novel end-to-end learning framework that we call\nLOUPE (Learning-based Optimization of the Under-sampling PattErn). Our method\ntrains a neural network model on a set of full-resolution MRI scans, which are\nretrospectively under-sampled on a 2D Cartesian grid and forwarded to an\nanti-aliasing (a.k.a. reconstruction) model that computes a reconstruction,\nwhich is in turn compared with the input. This formulation enables a\ndata-driven optimized under-sampling pattern at a given sparsity level. In our\nexperiments, we demonstrate that LOUPE-optimized under-sampling masks are\ndata-dependent, varying significantly with the imaged anatomy, and perform well\nwith different reconstruction methods. We present empirical results obtained\nwith a large-scale, publicly available knee MRI dataset, where LOUPE offered\nsuperior reconstruction quality across different conditions. Even with an\naggressive 8-fold acceleration rate, LOUPE's reconstructions contained much of\nthe anatomical detail that was missed by alternative masks and reconstruction\nmethods. Our experiments also show how LOUPE yielded optimal under-sampling\npatterns that were significantly different for brain vs knee MRI scans.

Measuring and\neliminating gerrymandering has enormous implications to sustain the backbone of\ndemocratic principles of a society. Although there is no dearth of legal briefs\ninvolving gerrymandering over many years, it is only more recently that\nmathematicians and applied computational researchers have started to\ninvestigate this topic. However, it has received relatively little attention so\nfar from the computational complexity researchers dealing with theoretical\nanalysis of computational complexity issues, such as computational hardness,\napproximability issues, etc. There could be many reasons for this, such as\ndescriptions of these problem non-CS non-math (often legal or political)\njournals that theoretical CS (TCS) people usually do not follow, or the lack of\ncoverage of these topics in TCS publication venues. One of our modest goals in\nwriting this article is to improve upon this situation by stimulating further\ninteractions between the gerrymandering and TCS researchers. To this effect,\nour main contributions are twofold: (1) we provide formalization of several\nmodels, related concepts, and corresponding problem statements using TCS\nframeworks from the descriptions of these problems as available in existing\nnon-TCS (perhaps legal) venues, and (2) we also provide computational\ncomplexity analysis of some versions of these problems, leaving other versions\nfor future research.\n  The goal of writing this article is not to have the final word on\ngerrymandering, but to introduce a series of concepts, models and problems to\nthe TCS community and to show that science of gerrymandering involves an\nintriguing set of partitioning problems involving geometric and combinatorial\noptimization.",

Thus far, most of the candidates are found in $4d$- and\n$5d$-electron compounds, in which the low-spin $d^5$ electron configuration\nsubject to strong spin-orbit coupling comprises a Kramers doublet with the\neffective angular momentum $j_{\\rm eff}=1/2$ and gives rise to the\nbond-dependent anisotropic interactions in the Kitaev model. Here we\ntheoretically investigate other candidates in $4f$-electron compounds with the\n$f^1$ electron configuration on both quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb and\nthree-dimensional hyperhoneycomb structures, $A_2$PrO$_3$ with $A$=Li, Na, K,\nRb, and Cs.

The most remarkable\nfeature is that the Kitaev interaction $K$ is antiferromagnetic, in contrast to\nthe ferromagnetic one in the $d^5$ candidates at hand.

As\na consequence, the compounds with $A$=Li and Na may have a dominant\nantiferromagnetic $K$, but $J$ dominates $K$ and $\\Gamma'$ in the cases with\n$A$=Rb and Cs. Also, by computing the ground states of the $J$-$K$-$\\Gamma'$\nmodel by using the exact diagonalization, we map out the systematic evolution\nof the model parameters in the phase diagram.

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the main surface characteristics which control the\nfoamability of solutions of various surfactants. Experiments with anionic,\ncationic and nonionic surfactants with different head groups and chain lengths\nare performed in a wide concentration range, from 0.001 mM to 100 mM. The\nelectrolyte concentration is also varied from 0 up to 100 mM. For all\nsurfactants studied, three regions in the dependence of the foamability, VA, on\nthe logarithm of surfactant concentration, lgCS, are observed. In Region 1, VA\nis very low and depends weakly on CS. In Region 2, VA increases steeply with\nCS. In Region 3, VA reaches a plateau. A key new element in our interpretation\nof the foaming data is that we use the surface tension measurements to\ndetermine the dependence of the main surface properties (surfactant adsorption,\nsurface coverage and surface elasticity) on the surface age of the bubbles. In\nthis way we interpret the results from the foaming tests by considering the\nproperties of the dynamic adsorption layers, formed during foaming. The data\nfor the nonionic and ionic surfactants merge around two master curves when\nplotted as a function of the surface coverage, the surface mobility factor, or\nthe Gibbs elasticity of the dynamic adsorption layers. This difference between\nthe ionic and nonionic surfactants is explained with the important contribution\nof the electrostatic repulsion between the foam film surfaces for the ionic\nsurfactants which stabilizes the dynamic foam films even at moderate surface\ncoverage and at relatively high ionic strength. In contrast, the films formed\nfrom solutions of nonionic surfactants are stabilized via steric repulsion\nwhich becomes sufficiently high to prevent bubble coalescence only at rather\nhigh surface coverage (> 90 %) which corresponds to related high Gibbs\nelasticity (> 150 mN/m) and low surface mobility of the dynamic adsorption\nlayers.",

Yet, unlike\ntraditional algorithms in this field, little is known about DNNs from the\nprinciples of numerical analysis, e.g., stability, accuracy, computational\nefficiency and sample complexity. In this paper we introduce a computational\nframework for examining DNNs in practice, and use it to study empirical\nperformance with regard to these issues. We study performance of DNNs of\ndifferent widths & depths on test functions in various dimensions, including\nsmooth and piecewise smooth functions. We also compare DL against best-in-class\nmethods for smooth function approx. based on compressed sensing (CS). Our main\nconclusion from these experiments is that there is a crucial gap between the\napproximation theory of DNNs and their practical performance, with trained DNNs\nperforming relatively poorly on functions for which there are strong\napproximation results (e.g. smooth functions), yet performing well in\ncomparison to best-in-class methods for other functions. To analyze this gap\nfurther, we provide some theoretical insights. We establish a practical\nexistence theorem, asserting existence of a DNN architecture and training\nprocedure that offers the same performance as CS. This establishes a key\ntheoretical benchmark, showing the gap can be closed, albeit via a strategy\nguaranteed to perform as well as, but no better than, current best-in-class\nschemes. Nevertheless, it demonstrates the promise of practical DNN approx., by\nhighlighting potential for better schemes through careful design of DNN\narchitectures and training strategies.",

The framework is built\nupon a novel compressive sensing (CS) regularized maximum likelihood\nformulation of the discrete-input detection problem, in which the L0-norm is\nintroduced to enforce adherence of the solution to the prescribed discrete\nsymbol constellation. Unlike much of preceding literature, the method is not\nrelaxed into the L1-norm, but rather approximated with a continuous and\nasymptotically exact expression without resorting to parallel interference\ncancellation. The objective function of the resulting formulation is thus a sum\nof concave-over-convex ratios, which is then tightly convexized via the\nquadratic transform, such that its solution can be obtained via the iteration\nof a simple closed-form expression that closely resembles that of the classic\nzero-forcing (ZF) receiver. By further transforming the aforementioned problem\ninto a quadratically constrained quadratic program with one convex constraint\n(QCQP-1), the optimal regularization parameter to be used at each step of the\niterative algorithm is then shown to be the largest generalized eigenvalue of a\npair of matrices which are given in closed-form. The method so obtained,\nreferred to as the IDLS, is then extended to address several factors of\npractical relevance, such as noisy conditions, imperfect CSI, and hardware\nimpairments, thus yielding the Robust IDLS algorithm.

We considered two values for\nthe energy barrier of the surface reaction, Ea = 2500 K (as originally\nimplemented in the networks) and Ea = 0 K (as measured in the laboratory and\ncomputed by quantum chemistry simulations). We find that if the C + H2 = CH2\nsurface reaction is barrierless, a more rapid conversion of the surface carbon\natoms into methane ice occurs. Overproduction of the CHn hydrocarbon ices\naffects the surface formation of more complex hydrocarbons, cyanides and\nnitriles, and CS-bearing species at low temperatures < 10-15 K. The surface\nhydrogenation of CO and hence the synthesis of complex (organic) molecules\nbecome affected as well. As a result, important species whose abundances may\nchange by more than a factor of two at 1 Myr include atomic carbon, small\nmono-carbonic (C1) and di-carbonic (C2) hydrocarbons, CO2, CN, HCN, HNC, HNCO,\nCS, H2CO, H2CS, CH2CO, and CH3OH (in either gas and/or ice). The abundances of\nkey species, CO, H2O, and N2 as well as O, HCO+, N2H+, NH3, NO, and most of the\nS-bearing molecules, remain almost unaffected. Further accurate laboratory\nmeasurements and quantum chemical calculations of the surface reaction barriers\nwill be crucial to improve the accuracy of astrochemical models.",

    "abstract": "Recently, halide perovskites have gained significant attention from the\nperspective of efficient spintronics owing to Rashba effect. This effect occurs\nas a consequence of strong spin-orbit coupling under noncentrosymmetric\nenvironment, which can be dynamic and/or static. However, there exist intense\ndebates on the origin of broken inversion symmetry since the halide perovskites\ntypically crystallize into a centrosymmetric structure. In order to clarify the\nissue, we examine both dynamic and static effects in the all-inorganic CsPbBr3\nand organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals by\nemploying temperature- and polarization-dependent photoluminescence excitation\nspectroscopy. The perovskite single crystals manifest the dynamic effect by\nphoton recycling in the indirect Rashba gap, causing dual peaks in the\nphotoluminescence. But the effect vanishes in CsPbBr3 at low temperatures (< 50\nK), accompanied by a striking color change of the crystal, arising presumably\nfrom lower degrees of freedom for inversion symmetry breaking associated with\nthe thermal motion of the spherical Cs cation, compared with the polar MA\ncation in MAPbBr3. We also show that static Rashba effect occurs only in\nMAPbBr3 below 90 K due to surface reconstruction via MA-cation ordering, which\nlikely extends across a few layers from the crystal surface to the interior. We\nfurther demonstrate that this static Rashba effect can be completely suppressed\nupon surface treatment with poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) coating. We believe\nthat our results provide a rationale for the Rashba effects in halide\nperovskites.",

Deep learning models (DLMs) can be\nleveraged to learn from large complex datasets and construct predictive\nclinical tools. This retrospective study was performed using 42,818 hospital\nadmissions involving 35,348 patients, which is a subset of the MIMIC-III\ndataset. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques were applied to build\nDLMs to predict in-hospital mortality (IHM) and length of stay >=7 days (LOS).\nOver 75 million events across multiple data sources were processed, resulting\nin over 355 million tokens. DLMs for predicting IHM using data from all sources\n(AS) and chart data (CS) achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.9178 and 0.9029,\nrespectively, and PR-AUC of 0.6251 and 0.5701, respectively. DLMs for\npredicting LOS using AS and CS achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.8806 and 0.8642,\nrespectively, and PR-AUC of 0.6821 and 0.6575, respectively. The observed\nAUC-ROC difference between models was found to be significant for both IHM and\nLOS at p=0.05. The observed PR-AUC difference between the models was found to\nbe significant for IHM and statistically insignificant for LOS at p=0.05. In\nthis study, deep learning models were constructed using data combined from a\nvariety of sources in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) such as chart data,\ninput and output events, laboratory values, microbiology events, procedures,\nnotes, and prescriptions. It is possible to predict in-hospital mortality with\nmuch better confidence and higher reliability from models built using all\nsources of data.",

We\nthen introduce the Wilson line and discuss the effective action on an $n$-sheet\nmanifold from the back-reaction of the Wilson line. The reason is that the U(1)\nChern-Simons theory can provide an exact effective action when introducing the\nWilson line. This study cannot be done in the SL(2) Chern-Simons formulation of\npure AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity theory. It is known that the expectation value of\nthe Wilson line in the pure AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity is equivalent to\nentanglement entropy in the boundary theory up to classical gravity. We show\nthat the boundary theory of the U(1) Chern-Simons theory deviates by a\nself-interaction term from the boundary theory of the AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity\ntheory. It provides a convenient path to the building of \"minimum\nsurface=entanglement entropy\" in the SL(2) Chern-Simons formulation. We also\ndiscuss the Hayward term in the SL(2) Chern-Simons formulation to compare with\nthe Wilson line approach. To reproduce the entanglement entropy for a single\ninterval at the classical level, we introduce two wedges under a regularization\nscheme. We propose the quantum generalization by combining the bulk and Hayward\nterms. The quantum correction of the partition function vanishes. In the end,\nwe exactly calculate the entanglement entropy for a single interval. The pure\nAdS$_3$ Einstein gravity theory shows a shift of central charge by 26 at the\none-loop level. The U(1) Chern-Simons theory does not have such a shift from\nthe quantum effect, and the result is the same in the weak gravitational\nconstant limit. The non-vanishing quantum correction shows the naive quantum\ngeneralization of the Hayward term is incorrect.",

The introduction of UV and IR 3-branes makes the anomaly\nstory remarkably rich and many interesting aspects can be obtained, including\nweakly gauging and spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global symmetries of\nthe dual 4D CFT. Our main contribution is to provide a unified and\ncomprehensive discussion of the subject, together with a detailed description\nof the dual CFT picture for each case.

In addition, we show that anomaly matching\noccurs for ABJ anomalies as well as 't Hooft anomalies, which suggests\nanomalies inflowed from the bulk CS theory are necessarily free of mixed\nanomalies with the confining gauge force of the 4D dual CFT. In the case of\nbroken symmetry, we prove that the \"would-be\" Goldstone bosons associated with\nthe weakly gauged symmetry are completely removed by a proper field\nredefinition, provided the anomaly from the bulk is exactly cancelled by the\nboundary contribution, hence confirming the standard expectation. Moreover, we\npresent a holographic formulation of Witten's argument for the quantization\ncondition for the WZW action, and argue in favor of an alternative way to\nobtain the same condition using a \"deformed\" theory (different BCs).

This leads to modification of JT\nstabilization energy and to the warping of the trough at each fullerene site,\nas well as to the interaction of JT distortions at different sites. Here we\ninvestigate these effects in three fcc fullerides with A=K,Rb,Cs and in\nCs$_3$C$_{60}$ with bcc (A15) structure. DFT calculations of orbital vibronic\ncoupling constants at C$_{60}$ sites and of phonon spectra have been done for\nfully ordered lattices (1 C$_{60}$/u.c.). Based on them the elastic response\nfunction for local JT distortions has been evaluated and the lowest APES\ninvestigated. To this end an expression for the latter in function of trough\ncoordinates of all sites has been derived. The results show that the JT\nstabilization energy slightly increases compared to an isolated C$_{60}^{3-}$\nand a warping of the trough of few meV occurs. The interaction of JT\ndistortions on nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor fullerene sites is of similar\norder of magnitude. These effects arise first of all due to the interaction of\nC$_{60}$ sites with the displacements of neighbor alkali atoms and are more\npronounced in fcc fullerides than in the A15 compound. The results of this\nstudy support the picture of weakly hindered independent rotations of JT\ndeformations at C$_{60}$ sites in cubic A$_3$C$_{60}$.",

    "title": "Geometric and computational aspects of chiral topological quantum matter",
    "abstract": "In this thesis, we study chiral topological phases of 2+1 dimensional quantum\nmatter. Such phases are abstractly characterized by their non-vanishing chiral\ncentral charge $c$, a topological invariant which appears as the coefficient of\na gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) action in bulk, and of corresponding\ngravitational anomalies at boundaries. The chiral central charge is of\nparticular importance in chiral superfluids and superconductors (CSF/Cs), where\n$U(1)$ particle-number symmetry is broken, and $c$ is, in some cases, the only\ntopological invariant characterizing the system. However, as opposed to\ninvariants which can be probed by gauge fields in place of gravity, the\nconcrete physical implications of $c$ in the context of condensed matter\nphysics is quite subtle, and has been the subject of ongoing research and\ncontroversy. The first two parts of this thesis are devoted to the physical\ninterpretation of the gCS action and gravitational anomalies in the context of\nCSF/Cs, where they are of particular importance, but have nevertheless remained\npoorly understood. We then turn to a seemingly unrelated aspect of chiral\ntopological phases - their computational complexity. The infamous $sign\\\nproblem$ leads to an exponential complexity in Monte Carlo simulations of\ngeneric many-body quantum systems. Nevertheless, many phases of matter are\nknown to admit a sign-problem-free representative, allowing an efficient\nclassical simulation. The possibility of $intrinsic$ sign problems, where a\nphase of matter admits no sign-problem-free representative, was recently raised\nbut remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish the existence of an\nintrinsic sign problem in a broad class of chiral topological phases, both\nbosonic and fermionic, defined by the requirement that $e^{2\\pi i c/24}$ is\n$not$ the topological spin of an anyon.",

Using the technique pioneered by\nLada et al 1994, we construct a Gaussian smoothed map of the infrared\nextinction with the same resolution as the molecular line observations in order\nto examine correlations of integrated intensities and molecular abundances with\nextinction for C17O, C34S, and N2H+. We find that over a visual extinction\nrange of 0 to 40 magnitudes, there is good evidence for the presence of\ndifferential gas-phase depletions in the densest portions of IC 5146. Both CO\nand CS exhibit a statistically significant (factor of ~3) abundance reduction\nnear Av ~ 12 magnitudes while, in direct contrast, at the highest extinctions,\nAv > 10 magnitudes, N2H+ appears relatively undepleted. Moreover, for Av < 4\nmagnitudes there exists little or no N2H+. This pattern of depletions is\nconsistent with the predictions of chemical theory.",

We derive physical parameters of\nthese cores using different approaches to the line radiative transfer problem.\nThe local radiative transfer approximations fail to provide reliable values\nexcept for the column densities. A self-consistent explanation of the observed\nline profiles is only possible when taking density gradients and an internal\nturbulent structure of the cores into account. The observational data can be\nfitted by a spherically symmetric radiative transfer model including such\ngradients and a turbulent clumping. We find that the observed massive cores are\napproximately virialised with a clumpy density profile that decays with a\nradial exponent of about -1.6 down to a relatively sharp outer boundary.\n  We show that a careful analysis of spatially unresolved multi-line\nobservations using a physical radiative transfer model can provide values for\nphysical parameters that could be obtained otherwise only by direct\nobservations with much higher spatial resolution. This applies to all\nquantities directly affecting the line excitation, like the mass and size of\ndense cores.

NIR spectroscopy\nrevealed a large amount of emission lines, including forbidden iron lines and\nP-Cygni profiles. The spectral energy distribution of the source points towards\na high luminosity and a high temperature, with an absorption greater than the\ninterstellar absorption, but two orders of magnitude lower than the X-ray\nabsorption. We show that the source is an High Mass X-ray binary (HMXB) at a\ndistance between ~1 and 6 kpc, the mass donor being an early-type star,\nprobably a sgB[e] star, surrounded by a rich and absorbing circumstellar\nmaterial. This would make the second High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) with a\nsgB[e] star after CI Cam, indicating that a new class of strongly absorbed\nX-ray binaries is being unveiled by INTEGRAL.",

The material is described by a spin Hamiltonian, determined\nwith precision in high field measurements, in which the main interaction is\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange between neighboring spins on an\nanisotropic triangular lattice. An additional, weak Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya\ninteraction introduces easy-plane anisotropy, so that behavior is different for\ntransverse and longitudinal field directions. We determine the phase diagram as\na function of field strength for both field directions at zero temperature,\nusing a classical approximation as a first step. Building on this, we calculate\nthe effect of quantum fluctuations on the ordering wavevector and components of\nthe ordered moments, using both linear spinwave theory and a mapping to a Bose\ngas which gives exact results when the magnetization is almost saturated.

This is true\nof mechanisms for combinatorial auctions, which have in recent years assumed\npractical importance, and in particular of the gold standard for combinatorial\nauctions, the Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). Traditional analysis of these\nmechanisms - in particular, their truth revelation properties - assumes that\nthe optimization problems are solved precisely. In reality, these optimization\nproblems can usually be solved only in an approximate fashion. We investigate\nthe impact on such mechanisms of replacing exact solutions by approximate ones.\nSpecifically, we look at a particular greedy optimization method. We show that\nthe GVA payment scheme does not provide for a truth revealing mechanism. We\nintroduce another scheme that does guarantee truthfulness for a restricted\nclass of players. We demonstrate the latter property by identifying natural\nproperties for combinatorial auctions and showing that, for our restricted\nclass of players, they imply that truthful strategies are dominant.

In all of the\nelicitation schemes under study, as the number of items for sale increases, the\namount of information elicited is a vanishing fraction of the information\ncollected in traditional ``direct revelation mechanisms'' where bidders reveal\nall their valuation information. Most of the elicitation schemes also maintain\nthe benefit as the number of agents increases. We develop more effective\nelicitation policies for existing query types.

Assuming that psi ->eta' gamma decay is dominated by psi ->eta_c\ntransition, we obtain |f_eta'^(c)| = 2.4 MeV which could imply that the (b ->\nc\\bar cs) mechanism does not play a major role in the B -> K eta' decay mode.",

At that time, I felt that there might not be a sound\nconsensus of opinion on the subject. Now, I would like to show my understanding\nhere, the essential part of which is based on hep-th/0110197.\n  The first problem discussed is a notion of ``bosonized electrons\n(bosonization)\", which are unphysical objects from the standpoint of the\nChern-Simons gauge invariance. Therefore, their condensate is merely of\nmathematical concept and the true physical state realized is a liquid-like one\nmade of degeneration of anyons. Based on this recognition, I argue about a\nmechanism of the degeneration that results from the genuine CS gauge field\ntheory. It is noted that the Ginzburg-Landau effective theory is not necessary.\nAs the last problem, the gauge invariance in the \"composite-fermion theories\"\nis discussed.",

    "abstract": "Using the {\\it analytic representation} of the so-called Gazeau-Klauder\ncoherent states(CSs), we shall demonstrate that how a new class of generalized\nCSs namely the {\\it family of dual states} associated with theses states can be\nconstructed through viewing these states as {\\it temporally stable nonlinear\nCSs}. Also we find that the ladder operators, as well as the displacement type\noperator corresponding to these two pairs of generalized CSs, may be easily\nobtained using our formalism, without employing the {\\it supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics}(SUSYQM) techniques. Then, we have applied this method to some\nphysical systems with known spectrum, such as P\\\"{o}schl-Teller, infinite well,\nMorse potential and Hydrogen-like spectrum as some quantum mechanical systems.\nFinally, we propose the generalized form of Gazeau-Klauder CS and the\ncorresponding dual family.",

An integral part of the four-wave mixing process is a\ncollective instability which spontaneously generates a periodic density\nmodulation in the cold atomic sample with a period equal to half of the\nwavelength of the generated high-frequency optical field. Due to the generation\nof this density modulation, phase-matching between the pump and scattered\nfields is not a necessary initial condition for this wave-mixing process to\noccur, rather the density modulation acts to \"self phase-match\" the fields\nduring the course of the wave-mixing process. We describe a one-dimensional\nmodel of this process, and suggest a proof-of-principle experiment which would\ninvolve pumping a sample of cold Cs atoms with three infra-red pump fields to\nproduce blue light.",

After integrating the system of\nEinstein-Maxwell equations with an arbitrary cosmological constant, we present\nthe complete family of solutions. In odd spacetime dimensions they represent\n(generalized) Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes. The event horizon (more\ngenerically, the transverse space) may be any Einstein space, and the full\nmetric is specified by three independent parameters related to mass, electric\ncharge and cosmological constant. These solutions also exhaust the class of\nRobinson-Trautman spacetimes with an aligned Maxwell-Chern-Simons field (the CS\nterm must vanish because of the alignment assumption and of the Einstein\nequations). In even dimensions an additional magnetic \"monopole-like\" parameter\nis also allowed provided now the transverse space is an (almost-)Kahler\nEinstein manifold. The Weyl tensor of all such solutions is of algebraic type\nD. We also consider the possible inclusion of aligned pure radiation.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the effects of different forms of the sound-velocity function\ncs(T) on the hydrodynamic evolution of matter formed in the central region of\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions. At high temperatures (above the critical\ntemperature Tc) the sound velocity is calculated from the recent lattice\nsimulations of QCD, while in the low temperature region it is obtained from the\nhadron gas model. In the intermediate region we use different interpolations\ncharacterized by the values of the sound velocity at the local maximum (at T =\n0.4 Tc) and local minimum (at T = Tc). In all considered cases the temperature\ndependent sound velocity functions yield the entropy density, which is\nconsistent with the lattice QCD simulations at high temperature. Our\ncalculations show that the presence of a distinct minimum of the sound velocity\nleads to a very long (about 20 fm/c) evolution time of the system, which is not\ncompatible with the recent estimates based on the HBT interferometry. Hence, we\nconclude that the hydrodynamic description is favored in the case where the\ncross-over phase transition renders the smooth sound velocity function with a\npossible shallow minimum at Tc.",

We observe a fast and\nefficient accumulation, about 70% of the initially detected molecules, in the\nlowest vibrational level, v = 0, of the singlet electronic state. The validity\nof this incoherent depopulation pumping method is very general and opens\nexciting prospects for laser cooling and manipulation of molecules.",

    "abstract": "We report magnetocaloric and magnetic-torque evidence that in\nCs$_{2}$CuBr$_{4}$ -- a geometrically frustrated Heisenberg $S=1/2$\ntriangular-lattice antiferromagnet -- quantum fluctuations stabilize a series\nof spin states at simple increasing fractions of the saturation magnetization\n$M_{s}$. Only the first of these states -- at $M={1/3}M_{s}$ -- has been\ntheoretically predicted. We discuss how the higher fraction quantum states\nmight arise and propose model spin arrangements. We argue that the first-order\nnature of the transitions into those states is due to strong lowering of the\nenergies by quantum fluctuations, with implications for the general character\nof quantum phase transitions in geometrically frustrated systems.",

The 32S/34S isotopic ratio is\n~10, supporting the idea of an isotopical 34S enrichment due to massive star\nformation in the nuclear regions of galaxies. Although C32S and C34S do not\nseem to be significantly affected by the activity type, the HNCO abundance\nappears highly contrasted among starburst. We observed HNCO abundance\nvariations of nearly two orders of magnitude. The HNCO molecule is shown to be\na good tracer of the amount of molecular material fueling the starburst and\ntherefore can be used as a diagnostics of the evolutionary state of a nuclear\nstarburst.",

Local\nelimination algorithms for discrete optimization (DO) problems (DOPs) with\nconstraints are considered; a classification of dynamic programming\ncomputational procedures is given. We introduce Elimination Game and\nElimination tree. Application of bucket elimination algorithm from constraint\nsatisfaction (CS) to solving DOPs is done.

Clustering that merges several\nvariables into single meta-variable defines a promising approach to solve DOPs.\nThis allows to create a quotient (condensed) graph and apply a local block\nelimination algorithm. In order to describe a block elimination process, we\nintroduce Block Elimination Game.
