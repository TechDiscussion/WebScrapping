      "abstract": "\n\n    A new type of message has been added to the LINE Messaging API, Flex Message. We\u2019ve been using a template-typed message in which you could place plain text, stickers, images, media types like videos, buttons and URLs. This type is quite useful for where the user had to select an option from available options, but there were restrictions such as the maximum number of buttons allowed, which is 4, for the button template, or the order in which you had to arrange the elements for a layout \u2014 title, content, and buttons.\n\nWhat is Flex Message?\n\n    The Flex Message type frees you from the old restrictions and enables you to arrange layouts as desired. There is a display frame, but you can change the layout as you do with HTML code, and each component is neatly displayed. Here are a few of the layouts you can compose with Flex Message.\n\n\n#LINE BOT #Messaging API\n",

For long, there has been no module system for JavaScript, but ever since Node.js started to use a module system called CommonJS from 2009, modular programming became a common practice.

I am back with a report on running the LINE Security Bug Bounty Program for the first half of 2017. For those of you who are new to this program, the purpose of this program is to provide LINE users the most secure service possible by letting external security researchers submit bug (vulnerability) reports which we would then immediately fix. Since our official launch of the program on June 2, 2016, we have expanded the program scope to include the following: \n\n\nLINE: Chrome version and Windows 10 Mobile version\n\n\nWebsite: LINE STORE, LINE NEWS, LINE MUSIC, and LINE LIVE\n\nFor those of you who are interested, check the press release on the program scope expansion.\n\n\n#Bug-Bounty #LINE-Bug-Bounty\n",

      "title": "Why we use Kotlin in LINE Creators Studio",
      "date": " 2017.07.20",
      "abstract": "\nBefore we begin\nHi everyone, I am Freddie Wang from LINE Fukuoka\u2019s development team. I\u2019m currently in charge of developing a new Android app called LINE Creators Studio. LINE Creators Studio is a sticker creation tool that lets anyone create his or her own stickers and sell them on LINE Store.\nIn this blog, I\u2019d like to talk about Kotlin, the programming language which the LINE Creators Studio app is built on. I will explain why we chose Kotlin as our main language and introduce some of the Kotlin features we are using.\nNote: LINE Creators Studio is currently available in Japan only. It will be released to other regions soon.\nAdvantages and key features of Kotlin\nWhy Kotlin?\nAt Google I/O 2017, Google announced that Kotlin is now officially supported in Android Studio 3.0. When we kicked off the development project for LINE Creators Studio at the end of 2016, we were tasked with the challenge of growing it into an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) project in a very short time. Although Kotlin 1.0 had been released quite some time ago, no one in our team had the experience of using Kotlin. We spent some time to conduct a survey on Kotlin before starting the development and eventually decided to use Kotlin because of the benefits it provides as described below.\n100% interoperable with Java\nThe most appealing aspect of Kotlin is that you can mix Kotlin code and Java code in the same project and continue to use all existing Java libraries. Although we don\u2019t have any legacy Java code in our project, we wanted to use some awesome libraries such as Dagger 2, Retrofit, and RxJava.\nConcise syntax\nKotlin is designed for solving problems. One of its main goals is to write clean code more easily than Java. This is the first and foremost essential factor for us when developing Android applications.\nReduced dependencies\nKotlin has a compact runtime library which can replace some large Java libraries such as Guava. Using large libraries may not be a problem in server or desktop environments but it can be problematic in Android. Because the Android environment puts 65K methods limit on Android apps, we should avoid using large Java libraries. Kotlin\u2019s stdlib library (version 1.1.3-2) has only 6306 methods, which means it has less impact than the Guava libraries in terms of the number of methods.\nCompatible with old Android devices\nKotlin 1.0 is based on Java 6, which means it can support Android devices whose version is 2.3 or higher. This is another very important factor for Android developers.\n#Android #Kotlin #Programming language\n",

      "date": " 2017.07.12",
      "abstract": "\nBefore we begin\nHello, we are Jongkyu Lim and Joonghoon Shin responsible for processing of ads data and development of ads platform in LINE. In this blog post, I\u2019d like to talk about BigDB: a big data processing pipeline for LINE ads. I\u2019ll go into detail about how BigDB came to be, what BigDB is, how it\u2019s structured, what it does, and what use cases it has.\nHow BigDB came to be\nAs we gather data from various services that are growing in size, the size of the data grows larger as well, making it difficult to properly use them for analysis. Up until now, we\u2019ve used several open solutions that support big data to tackle this problem. While using several of these open solutions that have different strengths and weaknesses, we felt the need for a more simple and standardized way to collect, process, and look up data. And that is where the idea for BigDB began. Below are some of the key features we had in mind for BigDB. \nIntroducing BigDB\nWhat is BigDB\nBigDB is a big data processing pipeline for LINE ads. It can collect, reprocess, and look up data. LINE ads are analyzed in two ways: The first is in real-time whenever an ad is shown to a user. The second is batch analysis, where events are collected and analyzed after a set time, such as hourly or daily. BigDB fluidly provides the data used for analysis. Sometimes combining time series and static data if necessary.  \n\n#Big-Database #Big-DB #Data-pipeline\n",

      "date": " 2017.07.10",
      "abstract": "\nHello, my name is Charlotte Yu and I am currently in charge of the business development and planning of the LINE Beacon platform in Taiwan.\nOne of the projects I\u2019m working on involves using LINE Beacon as a feasible location contextual technology which can play an important role in LINE\u2019s \u201cSmart Portal\u201d concept to bring people, information and services closer together and march toward our mission of \u201cCLOSING THE DISTANCE\u201d.\nCurrently, at this early stage, we are focusing on creating successful beacon deployments and use cases to raise user awareness and usage rates.\nOur strategy behind the LINE Beacon platform is to take advantage of LINE\u2019s extensive user base and other LINE services and features popular in Taiwan. We believe that location-awareness will be a driving force in the advancement of mobile technology, and that\u2019s why we are building a beacon network by deploying LINE Beacon to as many places as possible. This is in line with two key factors of the online-to-offline (O2O) ecosystem: geo-linked applications using location-aware technology and platforms with a high user base.\nO2O messaging is used to connect the online digital platform to offline merchants. In terms of commerce, the aim of O2O is to drive customers from the online marketplace and platforms (where they spend most of their time) to offline brick-and-mortar stores. This can happen through digital coupons, membership cards, and proximity marketing. That\u2019s why we designed various beacon applications to build online-to-offline networks where the virtual world expands to the real world.\nO2O and beacons link everyday products and features such as LINE Coupon, LINE Points, and LINE Shop Card to drive sales. We can push GeoADs (geo-linked advertisements) to promote stores, clients, and events with LINE business accounts (such as official accounts or LINE@ accounts) to nearby LINE users. By encouraging LINE users to walk into stores using LBS (location-based service) incentives such as coupons and stickers, we can enhance the user experience and help LINE@ owners, who have an LBS add-on such as indoor navigation or a shopping guide, achieve higher user retention rates.\n\n#Beacon #Bot #o2o\n",

On this post, I\u2019d like to share my visit to Elastic{ON} 2017 along with some pictures and brief summaries of each session I attended.\nIntroducing Elastic{ON} 2017\nOn Site\nElastic{ON} 2017 was held at Pier 48 in San Francisco, U.S.A from March 7th to 9th, 2017. As you can probably tell by the venue name, the conference was held in a warehouse-like building located near the AT&T Park. More than two thousand attendees came from all over the world. The conference was huge.\nElastic Stack products, especially Elasticsearch and Kibana, are widely used at LINE in various ways. I myself am using Elastic Stack in the monitoring system I am in charge of, to save, analyze and visualize events. Our monitoring system had no analyzing feature or visualizing feature until we used Elastic Stack to add these two features. Implementing the new features was simpler than I expected, thanks to Elastic Stack. However, I did encounter some issues while the system was up and running and solving the problems was quite difficult. Now, we are about to upgrade Elastic Stack to version 5.x. I was in a need to learn from other users\u2019 experiences and to learn new features and the optimal ways to implement the new features. This is why I attended the conference.\nLet me start by showing you some pictures of the conference.\nThe first thing I did at the conference was getting an attendee card. The conference site was bigger than I expected. The site consisted of session halls, AMA (Ask Me Anything) section, promotional booths, and Elastic booths where I was able to get my hands on the Elastic Stack products.\n\n#Elastic{ON} 2017 #elasticsearch #LINE Elasticsearch\n",

In this post, I\u2019d like to explain the architecture behind the chatting function of LINE LIVE, a video streaming service.\nIntroduction\nLINE LIVE for iOS and Android has a chat feature that lets its users send comments in real-time while they are watching a live-streaming video. This not only lets users (or viewers in this case) communicate with each other, but it also lets the streamers connect with their viewers. Streamers can chat with their viewers back and forth, and sometimes plan their videos according to what the viewers say in the chat. This is why the chat is an integral part of the streaming experience.\nAs you can probably imagine, celebrity live streams attract a large number of viewers, and along with them a torrent of comments. Comments sent to the stream must be simultaneously broadcast to every other viewer, and effectively distributing the load has always been one of our top-priority tasks. There are sometimes 10,000 comments sent per minute on just one stream alone.\nWe took the possibility of large amounts of comments into consideration when we were developing LINE LIVE and presently have over 100 server instances in operation for the chat feature.\n#Architecture #LINE LIVE\n",

There are many places in various LINE services where the number of characters must be counted such as profile or group names, and status messages. Counting the characters on-screen is important for several reasons. The text must not be shorter or longer than necessary, and storage capacity must be allocated accordingly. As LINE is used worldwide, it is crucial that string length can be precisely calculated for various languages. One day, we encountered an issue where emojis would be counted as 2 when they should count as 1. Originating from Japan, emoji is a language comprised of images used all around the world today.\n",

HTTP, well known for its use in web browsers, has its strengths and is well understood. It has its downsides as well, however. Simply put, HTTP was not designed for the types of real-time applications we see nowadays. HTTP is based on a simple request/response model: you send a request over a TCP connection, and wait for its response. HTTP does not fit well with a messaging service for the following reasons:\n",

BBFD is an internal CLI and continuous deployment tool that we use to build, package, test and deploy our Docker services.

When references access that object in different ways\u2014as both reads and stores\u2014there are consequences for the order in which these mixed accesses can happen. The value that is stored first is expected to be read by the subsequent access. In many instances, aliasing is harmless: It is common, safe, and usually optimally efficient to use two pointers of the same type to read, and even to write to the same object. But in some cases, using aliasing symbols for mixed accesses is less benign, and can adversely affect the correctness or efficiency of your code.",

On Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift, you can deploy Kafka Connect using the Strimzi and Red Hat AMQ Streams Operators. Kafka Connect lets users run sink and source connectors. Source connectors are used to load data from an external system into Kafka. Sink connectors work the other way around and let you load data from Kafka into another external system. In most cases, the connectors need to authenticate when connecting to the other systems, so you will need to provide credentials as part of the connector\u2019s configuration. This article shows you how you can use Kubernetes secrets to store the credentials and then use them in the connector\u2019s configuration.",

Whatever the case, chances are you’ve underestimated what it takes to build and maintain IoT devices and make everything reliable enough to serve your business properly.\nTwilio’s decades of collective experience helping companies bring IoT products to market unfortunately show us that too many businesses simply fail their business case: it takes them years – not months – to establish reliable connectivity, and many give up before reaching a return on investment or even a functioning deployment.\nIn this post, I’ll explain the challenges of IoT, …",

As we look towards 2021, questions remain around the timing of full ecosystem adoption, what processes and requirements may change, and the impact on deliverability and throughput.It’s best to think of the A2P 10DLC changes in two main categories: (1) Routes, and (2) Registration.

Read more on gas prices, and how they skyrocketed earlier this summer here. Savvy users wait for lower gas prices to interact with Ethereum smart contracts. Twilio’s SMS API is the perfect tool to keep you updated on prices.  I am going to show you how to write a serverless application to send SMS notifications when gas fees are below a certain level.\nIf you aren’t interested in gas prices, the flow in this tutorial can be used to query and connect any https REST api via Serverless to Twilio’s SMS api. …",

And, if a development team has decided upon a Node.js stack for the back-end, the benefits of TypeScript are enormous for safety, developer productivity, and new developer onboarding.\nTypeScript is an extension of pure JavaScript - a “superset”, if you will - and adds static typing to the language. It enforces type safety, makes code easier to reason about, and permits the implementation of classic patterns in a more “traditional” manner. As a language extension, all JavaScript is valid TypeScript, and TypeScript is compiled down to JavaScript.\nWith Twilio Functions, you can easily create “serverless” applications that are natively integrated with the Twilio ecosystem. That means support for SMS messages, for example, is first-class. You won’t have to manage infrastructure or provision servers, and you can very quickly move from development to production. …",

Omid complements Apache HBase, a distributed key-value store in Apache Hadoop suite, with a capability to clip multiple operations into logically indivisible (atomic) units named transactions. This programming model has been extremely popular since the dawn of SQL databases, and has more recently become indispensable in the NoSQL world.

The data we have in this database must be persistent, and the working set is larger than what we can fit in memory. Therefore, a key component of the database performance is a fast storage engine.

Modern decision support and machine intelligence engines strive to continuously ingest large volumes of data while providing up-to-date insights with minimum delay. For example, in Flurry Analytics, an Oath service which provides mobile developers with rich tools to explore user behavior in real time, it only takes seconds to reflect the events that happened on mobile devices in its numerous dashboards. The scalability demand is immense – as of late 2017, the Flurry SDK was installed on 2.6B devices and monitored 1M+ mobile apps. Mobile data hits the Flurry backend at a huge rate, updates statistics across hundreds of dimensions, and becomes queryable immediately. Flurry harnesses the open-source distributed interactive analytics engine named Druid to ingest data and serve queries at this massive rate.",

It launched with a whopping 552 apps available for download, including the Yelp app!

While we love seeing screenshots of these reviews shared on other websites, they don’t make for a great user experience. Their image formats make it easy to create and share but they become outdated, load slower than text, and make it hard for users to find out more about the business. We wanted to build something that retains screenshots’ ease of sharing while solving some their biggest shortcomings, so we created embedded reviews. Now,...",

At first, new flowers are welcome — maybe the new pattern seems easier to use, more scalable, more efficient, or more suited to some particular task than the old. As a code base grows, and the flowers proliferate, however, it becomes clear which patterns work and which don’t. Suddenly, code patterns that...",
