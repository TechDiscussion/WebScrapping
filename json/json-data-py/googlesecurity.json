      "title": "A New Standard for Mobile App Security",
      "date": "April 15, 2021",
      "abstract": "A New Standard for Mobile App Security\nWith all of the challenges from this past year, users have become increasingly dependent on their mobile devices to create fitness routines, stay connected with loved ones, work remotely, and order things like groceries with ease. According to eMarketer, in 2020 users spent over three and a half hours per day using mobile apps. With so much time spent on mobile devices, ensuring the safety of mobile apps is more important than ever. Despite the importance of digital security, there isn\u2019t a consistent industry standard for assessing mobile apps. Existing guidelines tend to be either too lightweight or too onerous for the average developer, and lack a compliance arm. That\u2019s why we're excited to share ioXt\u2019s announcement of a new Mobile Application Profile which provides a set of security and privacy requirements with defined acceptance criteria which developers can certify their apps against.eMarketerioXt\u2019s announcementMobile Application Profile\nOver 20 industry stakeholders, including Google, Amazon, and a number of certified labs such as NCC Group and Dekra, as well as automated mobile app security testing vendors like NowSecure collaborated to develop this new security standard for mobile apps. We\u2019ve seen early interest from Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual private network (VPN) developers, however the standard is appropriate for any cloud connected service such as social, messaging, fitness, or productivity apps.\nThe Internet of Secure Things Alliance (ioXt) manages a security compliance assessment program for connected devices. ioXt has over 300 members across various industries, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, T-Mobile, Comcast, Zigbee Alliance, Z-Wave Alliance, Legrand, Resideo, Schneider Electric, and many others. With so many companies involved, ioXt covers a wide range of device types, including smart lighting, smart speakers, and webcams, and since most smart devices are managed through apps, they have expanded coverage to include mobile apps with the launch of this profile.Internet of Secure Things Alliance (ioXt)\nThe ioXt Mobile Application Profile provides a minimum set of commercial best practices for all cloud connected apps running on mobile devices.  This security baseline helps mitigate against common threats and reduces the probability of significant vulnerabilities.  The profile leverages existing standards and principles set forth by OWASP MASVS and the VPN Trust Initiative, and allows developers to differentiate security capabilities around cryptography, authentication, network security, and vulnerability disclosure program quality. The profile also provides a framework to evaluate app category specific requirements which may be applied based on the features contained in the app. For example, an IoT app only needs to certify under the Mobile Application profile, whereas a VPN app must comply with the Mobile Application profile, plus the VPN extension.Mobile Application ProfileOWASP MASVSVPN Trust Initiative\nCertification allows developers to demonstrate product safety and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity for this standard to push the industry forward. We observed that app developers were very quick to resolve any issues that were identified during their blackbox evaluations against this new standard, oftentimes with turnarounds in a matter of days. At launch, the following apps have been certified: Comcast, ExpressVPN, GreenMAX, Hubspace, McAfee Innovations, NordVPN, OpenVPN for Android, Private Internet Access, VPN Private, as well as the Google One app, including VPN by Google One.ComcastExpressVPNGreenMAXHubspaceMcAfee InnovationsNordVPNOpenVPN for AndroidPrivate Internet AccessVPN PrivateGoogle OneVPN by Google One\nWe look forward to seeing adoption of the standard grow over time and for those app developers that are already investing in security best practices to be able to highlight their efforts. The standard also serves as a guiding light to inspire more developers to invest in mobile app security.

      "title": "Rust in the Linux kernel",
      "date": "April 14, 2021",
      "abstract": "Rust in the Linux kernel\nIn our previous post, we announced that Android now supports the Rust programming language for developing the OS itself. Related to this, we are also participating in the effort to evaluate the use of Rust as a supported language for developing the Linux kernel. In this post, we discuss some technical aspects of this work using a few simple examples.previous postRust\nC has been the language of choice for writing kernels for almost half a century because it offers the level of control and predictable performance required by such a critical component. Density of memory safety bugs in the Linux kernel is generally quite low due to high code quality, high standards of code review, and carefully implemented safeguards. However, memory safety bugs do still regularly occur. On Android, vulnerabilities in the kernel are generally considered high-severity because they can result in a security model bypass due to the privileged mode that the kernel runs in.memory safety bugs do still regularly occur\nWe feel that Rust is now ready to join C as a practical language for implementing the kernel. It can help us reduce the number of potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in privileged code while playing nicely with the core kernel and preserving its performance characteristics.\nWe developed an initial prototype of the Binder driver to allow us to make meaningful comparisons between the safety and performance characteristics of the existing C version and its Rust counterpart. The Linux kernel has over 30 million lines of code, so naturally our goal is not to convert it all to Rust but rather to allow new code to be written in Rust. We believe this incremental approach allows us to benefit from the kernel\u2019s existing high-performance implementation while providing kernel developers with new tools to improve memory safety and maintain performance going forward.initial prototypeWe joined the Rust for Linux organization, where the community had already done and continues to do great work toward adding Rust support to the Linux kernel build system. We also need designs that allow code in the two languages to interact with each other: we're particularly interested in safe, zero-cost abstractions that allow Rust code to use kernel functionality written in C, and how to implement functionality in idiomatic Rust that can be called seamlessly from the C portions of the kernel.Rust for Linux\nSince Rust is a new language for the kernel, we also have the opportunity to enforce best practices in terms of documentation and uniformity. For example, we have specific machine-checked requirements around the usage of unsafe code: for every unsafe function, the developer must document the requirements that need to be satisfied by callers to ensure that its usage is safe; additionally, for every call to unsafe functions (or usage of unsafe constructs like dereferencing a raw pointer), the developer must document the justification for why it is safe to do so.\nJust as important as safety, Rust support needs to be convenient and helpful for developers to use. Let\u2019s get into a few examples of how Rust can assist kernel developers in writing drivers that are safe and correct.\nWe'll use an implementation of a semaphore character device. Each device has a current value; writes of n bytes result in the device value being incremented by n; reads decrement the value by 1 unless the value is 0, in which case they will block until they can decrement the count without going below 0.\n  Suppose semaphore is a file representing our device. We can interact with it from the shell as follows: > cat semaphore\n  When semaphore is a newly initialized device, the command above will block because the device's current value is 0. It will be unblocked if we run the following command from another shell because it increments the value by 1, which allows the original read to complete:\n> echo -n a > semaphoreWe could also increment the count by more than 1 if we write more data, for example:\n> echo -n abc > semaphore\nincrements the count by 3, so the next 3 reads won't block.\nTo allow us to show a few more aspects of Rust, we'll add the following features to our driver: remember what the maximum value was throughout the lifetime of a device, and remember how many reads each file issued on the device.\nWe'll now show how such a driver would be implemented in Rust, contrasting it with a C implementation. We note, however, we are still early on so this is all subject to change in the future. How Rust can assist the developer is the aspect that we'd like to emphasize. For example, at compile time it allows us to eliminate or greatly reduce the chances of introducing classes of bugs, while at the same time remaining flexible and having minimal overhead.implemented in RustC implementation\nA developer needs to do the following to implement a driver for a new character device in Rust:FileOperationsstruct file_operationsFileOpener\nThe following outlines how the first two steps of our example compare in Rust and C:\nCharacter devices in Rust benefit from a number of safety features:PointerWrapperBox<T>Arc<T>interior mutabilityMutex<T>SpinLock<T>atomicsmiscdevicecdevcontainer_ofneovimrust-analyzerdeclare_file_operations\nFor a driver to provide a custom ioctl handler, it needs to implement the\u00a0ioctl function that is part of the FileOperations trait, as exemplified in the table below.ioctl\nIoctl commands are standardized such that, given a command, we know whether a user buffer is provided, its intended use (read, write, both, none), and its size. In Rust, we provide a dispatcher (accessible by calling cmd.dispatch) that uses this information to automatically create user memory access helpers and pass them to the caller.dispatcher\nA driver is not required to use this though. If, for example, it doesn't use the standard ioctl encoding, Rust offers the flexibility of simply calling cmd.raw to extract the raw arguments and using them to handle the ioctl (potentially with unsafe code, which will need to be justified).\nHowever, if a driver implementation does use the standard dispatcher, it will benefit from not having to implement any unsafe code, and:UserSlicePtrWriterUserSlicePtrWriterUserSlicePtrReader\nAll of the above could potentially also be done in C, but it's very easy for developers to (likely unintentionally) break contracts that lead to unsafety; Rust requires unsafe blocks for this, which should only be used in rare cases and brings additional scrutiny. Additionally, Rust offers the following:SendSyncWe allow developers to use mutexes and spinlocks to provide interior mutability. In our example, we use a mutex to protect mutable data; in the tables below we show the data structures we use in C and Rust, and how we implement a wait until the count is nonzero so that we can satisfy a read:\nWe note that such waits are not uncommon in the existing C code, for example, a pipe waiting for a \"partner\" to write, a unix-domain socket waiting for data, an inode search waiting for completion of a delete, or a user-mode helper waiting for state change.pipe waitingunix-domain socket waitinginode search waitinguser-mode helper waiting\nThe following are benefits from the Rust implementation:be synchronized\nIn the tables below, we show how open, read, and write are implemented in our example driver:\nThey illustrate other benefits brought by Rust:\nThe examples above are only a small part of the whole project. We hope it gives readers a glimpse of the kinds of benefits that Rust brings. At the moment we have nearly all generic kernel functionality needed by Binder neatly wrapped in safe Rust abstractions, so we are in the process of gathering feedback from the broader Linux kernel community with the intent of upstreaming the existing Rust support.gathering feedback from the broader Linux kernel community\nWe also continue to make progress on our Binder prototype, implement additional abstractions, and smooth out some rough edges. This is an exciting time and a rare opportunity to potentially influence how the Linux kernel is developed, as well as inform the evolution of the Rust language.

      "date": "April 6, 2021",
      "abstract": "Rust in the Android platform\nCorrectness of code in the Android platform is a top priority for the security, stability, and quality of each Android release. Memory safety bugs in C and C++ continue to be the most-difficult-to-address source of incorrectness. We invest a great deal of effort and resources into detecting, fixing, and mitigating this class of bugs, and these efforts are effective in preventing a large number of bugs from making it into Android releases. Yet in spite of these efforts, memory safety bugs continue to be a top contributor of stability issues, and consistently represent ~70% of Android\u2019s high severity security vulnerabilities.70%\nIn addition to ongoing and upcoming efforts to improve detection of memory bugs, we are ramping up efforts to prevent them in the first place. Memory-safe languages are the most cost-effective means for preventing memory bugs. In addition to memory-safe languages like Kotlin and Java, we\u2019re excited to announce that the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) now supports the Rust programming language for developing the OS itself.ongoingupcoming\nManaged languages like Java and Kotlin are the best option for Android app development. These languages are designed for ease of use, portability, and safety. The Android Runtime (ART) manages memory on behalf of the developer. The Android OS uses Java extensively, effectively protecting large portions of the Android platform from memory bugs. Unfortunately, for the lower layers of the OS, Java and Kotlin are not an option.Android Runtime (ART)\nLower levels of the OS require systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. These languages are designed with control and predictability as goals. They provide access to low level system resources and hardware. They are light on resources and have more predictable performance characteristics.For C and C++, the developer is responsible for managing memory lifetime. Unfortunately, it's easy to make mistakes when doing this, especially in complex and multithreaded codebases.it's easy to make mistakes\nRust provides memory safety guarantees by using a combination of compile-time checks to enforce object lifetime/ownership and runtime checks to ensure that memory accesses are valid. This safety is achieved while providing equivalent performance to C and C++.\nC and C++ languages don\u2019t provide these same safety guarantees and require robust isolation. All Android processes are sandboxed and we follow the Rule of 2 to decide if functionality necessitates additional isolation and deprivileging. The Rule of 2 is simple: given three options, developers may only select two of the following three options.Rule of 2\nFor Android, this means that if code is written in C/C++ and parses untrustworthy input, it should be contained within a tightly constrained and unprivileged sandbox. While adherence to the Rule of 2 has been effective in reducing the severity and reachability of security vulnerabilities, it does come with limitations. Sandboxing is expensive: the new processes it requires consume additional overhead and introduce latency due to IPC and additional memory usage. Sandboxing doesn\u2019t eliminate vulnerabilities from the code and its efficacy is reduced by high bug density, allowing attackers to chain multiple vulnerabilities together.adherence to the Rule of 2consume additional overhead and introduce latencyhigh bug density\nMemory-safe languages like Rust help us overcome these limitations in two ways:\nOf course, introducing a new programming language does nothing to address bugs in our existing C/C++ code. Even if we redirected the efforts of every software engineer on the Android team, rewriting tens of millions of lines of code is simply not feasible.\nThe above analysis of the age of memory safety bugs in Android (measured from when they were first introduced) demonstrates why our memory-safe language efforts are best focused on new development and not on rewriting mature C/C++ code. Most of our memory bugs occur in new or recently modified code, with about 50% being less than a year old.\nThe comparative rarity of older memory bugs may come as a surprise to some, but we\u2019ve found that old code is not where we most urgently need improvement. Software bugs are found and fixed over time, so we would expect the number of bugs in code that is being maintained but not actively developed to go down over time. Just as reducing the number and density of bugs improves the effectiveness of sandboxing, it also improves the effectiveness of bug detection.\nBug detection via robust testing, sanitization, and fuzzing is crucial for improving the quality and correctness of all software, including software written in Rust. A key limitation for the most effective memory safety detection techniques is that the erroneous state must actually be triggered in instrumented code in order to be detected. Even in code bases with excellent test/fuzz coverage, this results in a lot of bugs going undetected.sanitizationfuzzing\nAnother limitation is that bug detection is scaling faster than bug fixing. In some projects, bugs that are being detected are not always getting fixed. Bug fixing is a long and costly process.bug detection is scaling faster than bug fixingbugs that are being detected are not always getting fixed\n Each of these steps is costly, and missing any one of them can result in the bug going unpatched for some or all users. For complex C/C++ code bases, often there are only a handful of people capable of developing and reviewing the fix, and even with a high amount of effort spent on fixing bugs, sometimes the fixes are incorrect.sometimes the fixes are incorrect\nBug detection is most effective when bugs are relatively rare and dangerous bugs can be given the urgency and priority that they merit. Our ability to reap the benefits of improvements in bug detection require that we prioritize preventing the introduction of new bugs.\nRust modernizes a range of other language aspects, which results in improved correctness of code:Fearless ConcurrencyRage Against the Cageauto initializing memory in C/C++\nAdding a new language to the Android platform is a large undertaking. There are toolchains and dependencies that need to be maintained, test infrastructure and tooling that must be updated, and developers that need to be trained. For the past 18 months we have been adding Rust support to the Android Open Source Project, and we have a few early adopter projects that we will be sharing in the coming months. Scaling this to more of the OS is a multi-year project. Stay tuned, we will be posting more updates on this blog.\nJava is a registered trademark of Oracle and/or its affiliates.\nThanks Matthew Maurer, Bram Bonne, and Lars Bergstrom for contributions to this post.

      "abstract": "A Spectre proof-of-concept for a Spectre-proof webPosted by Stephen R\u00f6ttger and Artur Janc, Information Security EngineersThree years ago, Spectre changed the way we think about security boundaries on the web. It quickly became clear that flaws in modern processors undermined the guarantees that web browsers could make about preventing data leaks between applications. As a result, web browser vendors have been continuously collaborating on approaches intended to harden the platform at scale. Nevertheless, this class of attacks still remains a concern and requires web developers to deploy application-level mitigations.Spectreflaws in modern processorsapplication-level mitigationsIn this post, we will share the results of Google Security Team's research on the exploitability of Spectre against web users, and present a fast, versatile proof-of-concept (PoC) written in JavaScript which can leak information from the browser's memory. We've confirmed that this proof-of-concept, or its variants, function across a variety of operating systems, processor architectures, and hardware generations.By sharing our findings with the security community, we aim to give web application owners a better understanding of the impact Spectre vulnerabilities can have on the security of their users' data. Finally, this post describes the protections available to web authors and best practices for enabling them in web applications, based on our experience across Google.A bit of backgroundThe Spectre vulnerability, disclosed to the public in January 2018, makes use of a class of processor (CPU) design vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to change the intended program control flow while the CPU is speculatively executing subsequent instructions. For example, the CPU may speculate that a length check passes, while in practice it will access out-of-bounds memory. While the CPU state is rolled back once the misprediction is noticed, this behavior leaves observable side effects which can leak data to an attacker.SpectredisclosedIn 2019, the team responsible for V8, Chrome\u2019s JavaScript engine, published a blog post and whitepaper concluding that such attacks can\u2019t be reliably mitigated at the software level. Instead, robust solutions to these issues require security boundaries in applications such as web browsers to be aligned with low-level primitives, for example process-based isolation.blog postwhitepapercan\u2019t be reliably mitigatedprocess-based isolationIn parallel, browser vendors and standards bodies developed security mechanisms to protect web users from these classes of attacks. This included both architectural changes which offer default protections enabled in some browser configurations (such as Site Isolation, out-of-process iframes, and Cross-Origin Read Blocking), as well as broadly applicable opt-in security features that web developers can deploy in their applications: Cross-Origin Resource Policy, Cross-Origin Opener Policy, Cross-Origin Embedder Policy, and others.Site Isolationout-of-process iframesCross-Origin Read BlockingCross-Origin Resource PolicyCross-Origin Opener PolicyCross-Origin Embedder PolicyThese mechanisms, while crucially important, don't prevent the exploitation of Spectre; rather, they protect sensitive data from being present in parts of the memory from which they can be read by the attacker. To evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it's therefore important to develop security tools that help security engineers understand the practical implications of speculative execution attacks for their applications.Demonstrating Spectre in a web browserToday, we\u2019re sharing proof-of-concept (PoC) code that confirms the practicality of Spectre exploits against JavaScript engines. We use Google Chrome to demonstrate our attack, but these issues are not specific to Chrome, and we expect that other modern browsers are similarly vulnerable to this exploitation vector. We have developed an interactive demonstration of the attack available at https://leaky.page/; the code and a more detailed writeup are published on Github here.https://leaky.page/hereThe demonstration website can leak data at a speed of 1kB/s when running on Chrome 88 on an Intel Skylake CPU. Note that the code will likely require minor modifications to apply to other CPUs or browser versions; however, in our tests the attack was successful on several other processors, including the Apple M1 ARM CPU, without any major changes.While experimenting, we also developed other PoCs with different properties. Some examples include:A PoC which can leak 8kB/s of data at a cost of reduced stability using performance.now() as a timer with 5\u03bcs precision.performance.now()A PoC which leaks data at 60B/s using timers with a precision of 1ms or worse.We chose to release the current PoC since it has a negligible setup time and works in the absence of high precision timers, such as SharedArrayBuffer.The main building blocks of the PoC are:A Spectre gadget: code that triggers attacker-controlled transient execution.A side-channel: a way to observe side effects of the transient execution.1. The gadgetFor the published PoC, we implemented a simple Variant 1 gadget: a JavaScript array is speculatively accessed out of bounds after training the branch predictor that the compiler-inserted length check will succeed. This particular gadget can be mitigated at the software level; however, Chrome's V8 team concluded that this is not the case for other gadgets: \u201cwe found that effective mitigation of some variants of Spectre, particularly variant 4, to be simply infeasible in software.\u201dVariant 1concludedWe invite the security community to extend our research and develop code that makes use of other Spectre gadgets.2. The side-channelA common way to leak secret data via speculative execution is to use a cache side-channel. By observing if a certain memory location is present in the cache or not, we can infer if it has been accessed during the speculative execution. The challenge in JavaScript is to find a high resolution timer allowing to distinguish cache from memory accesses, as modern browsers have reduced the timer granularity of the performance.now() API and disabled SharedArrayBuffers in contexts without cross-origin isolation to prevent timing attacks.side-channelperformance.now()SharedArrayBuffersAlready in 2018, the V8 team shared their observation that reduced timer granularity is not sufficient to mitigate Spectre, since attackers can arbitrarily amplify timing differences. The presented amplification technique was based on reading secret data multiple times which can, however, reduce the effectiveness of the attack if the information leak is probabilistic.observationIn our PoC, we developed a new technique that overcomes this limitation. By abusing the behavior of the Tree-PLRU cache eviction strategy commonly found in modern CPUs, we were able to significantly amplify the cache timing with a single read of secret data. This allowed us to leak data efficiently even with low precision timers. For technical details, see the demonstration at https://leaky.page/plru.html.Tree-PLRUhttps://leaky.page/plru.htmlWhile we don't believe this particular PoC can be re-used for nefarious purposes without significant modifications, it serves as a compelling demonstration of the risks of Spectre. In particular, we hope it provides a clear signal for web application developers that they need to consider this risk in their security evaluations and take active steps to protect their sites.Deploying web defenses against SpectreThe low-level nature of speculative execution vulnerabilities makes them difficult to fix comprehensively, as a proper patch can require changes to the firmware or hardware on the user's device. While operating system and web browser developers have implemented important built-in protections where possible (including Site Isolation with out-of-process iframes and Cross-Origin Read Blocking in Google Chrome, or Project Fission in Firefox), the design of existing web APIs still makes it possible for data to inadvertently flow into an attacker's process.difficultSite Isolationout-of-process iframesCross-Origin Read BlockingProject FissionWith this in mind, web developers should consider more robustly isolating their sites by using new security mechanisms that actively deny attackers access to cross-origin resources. These protections mitigate Spectre-style hardware attacks and common web-level cross-site leaks, but require developers to assess the threat these vulnerabilities pose to their applications and understand how to deploy them. To assist in that evaluation, Chrome's web platform security team has published Post-Spectre Web Development and Mitigating Side-Channel Attacks with concrete advice for developers; we strongly recommend following their guidance and enabling the following protections:new security mechanismscross-site leaksPost-Spectre Web DevelopmentMitigating Side-Channel AttacksCross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP) and Fetch Metadata Request Headers allow developers to control which sites can embed their resources, such as images or scripts, preventing data from being delivered to an attacker-controlled browser renderer process. See resourcepolicy.fyi and web.dev/fetch-metadata.Cross-Origin Resource PolicyFetch Metadata Request Headersrenderer processresourcepolicy.fyiweb.dev/fetch-metadataCross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP) lets developers ensure that their application window will not receive unexpected interactions from other websites, allowing the browser to isolate it in its own process. This adds an important process-level protection, particularly in browsers which don't enable full Site Isolation; see web.dev/coop-coep.Cross-Origin Opener Policyweb.dev/coop-coepCross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP) ensures that any authenticated resources requested by the application have explicitly opted in to being loaded.\u00a0 Today, to guarantee process-level isolation for highly sensitive applications in Chrome or Firefox, applications must enable both COEP and COOP; see web.dev/coop-coep.Cross-Origin Embedder Policyweb.dev/coop-coepIn addition to enabling these isolation mechanisms, ensure your application also enables standard protections, such as the X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options headers, and uses SameSite cookies. Many Google applications have already deployed, or are in the process of deploying these mechanisms, providing a defense against speculative execution bugs in situations where default browser protections are insufficient.X-Frame-OptionsX-Content-Type-OptionsSameSite cookiesIt's important to note that while all of the mechanisms described in this article are important and powerful security primitives, they don't guarantee complete protection against Spectre; they require a considered deployment approach which takes behaviors specific to the given application into account.

      "date": "March 11, 2021",
      "abstract": "Continuing to Raise the Bar for Verifiable Security on Pixel\nEvaluating the security of mobile devices is difficult, and a trusted way to validate a company\u2019s claims is through independent, industry certifications. When it comes to smartphones one of the most rigorous end-to-end certifications is the Common Criteria (CC) Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF) Protection Profile. Common Criteria is the driving force for establishing widespread mutual recognition of secure IT products across 31 countries . Over the past few years only three smartphone manufacturers have continually been certified on every OS version: Google, Samsung, and Apple. At the beginning of February, we successfully completed this certification for all currently supported Pixel smartphones running Android 11. Google is the first manufacturer to be certified on the latest OS version.Common Criteria (CC) Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF) Protection ProfileCommon CriteriaPixel smartphones running Android 11This specific certification is designed to evaluate how a device defends against the real-world threats facing both consumers and businesses. The table below outlines the threats and mitigations provided in the CC MDF protection profile:ThreatsMitigationsNetwork Eavesdropping - An attacker is positioned on a wireless communications channel or elsewhere on the network infrastructureNetwork Attack - An attacker is positioned on a wireless communications channel or elsewhere on the network infrastructureProtected Communications - Standard protocols such as IPsec, DTLS, TLS, HTTPS, and Bluetooth to ensure encrypted communications are secureAuthorization and Authentication - Secure authentication for networks and backendsMobile Device Configuration - Capabilities for configuring and applying security policies defined by the user and/or Enterprise AdministratorPhysical Access - An attacker, with physical access, may attempt to retrieve user data on the mobile device, including credentialsProtected Storage - Secure storage (that is, encryption of data-at-rest) for data contained on the deviceAuthorization and Authentication - Secure device authentication using a known unlock factor, such as a password, PIN, fingerprint, or face authenticationEnd User Privacy and Device Functionality - Application isolation/sandboxing and framework permissions provide separation and privacy between user activitiesEnd User Privacy and Device Functionality - Application isolation/sandboxing and framework permissions provide separation and privacy between user activities\nWhat makes this certification important is the fact that it is a hands on evaluation done by an  authorized lab to evaluate the device and perform a variety of tests to ensure that:\nAt a high level, the target of evaluation (TOE) is the combination of device hardware (i.e. system on chip) and operating system (i.e. Android). In order to validate our mitigations for the threats listed above, the lab looks at the following security functionality:Titan Mfile-based encryptionkeystore operationsunlocking the user\u2019s devicesBiometricFalse Acceptance and Spoof Acceptance RatesVerified BootGoogle Play System UpdatesSeamless OS Updateslog eventsusing Android EnterpriseWhy this is important for enterprises\nIt\u2019s incredibly important to ensure Pixel security can specifically support enterprise needs. Many regulated industries require the use of Common Criteria certified devices to ensure that sensitive data is backed by the strongest possible protections. The Android Enterprise management framework enables enterprises to do things like control devices by setting restrictions around what the end user can do and audit devices to ensure all software settings are configured properly. For example, enterprise IT admins wish to enforce policies for features like the camera, location services or app installation process.Why this is important for consumers\nSecurity isn\u2019t just an enterprise concern and many of the protections validated by Common Criteria certification apply to consumers as well. For example, when you\u2019re connecting to Wi-Fi, you want to ensure no one can spy on your web browsing. If your device is lost or stolen, you want to be confident that your lock screen can reduce the chances of someone accessing your personal information.\nWe believe in making security & privacy accessible to all of our users. This is why we  take care to ensure that Pixel devices meet or exceed these certification standards.. We\u2019re committed to meeting these standards moving forward, so you can rest assured that your Pixel phone comes with top-of-the-line security built in, from the moment you turn it on.Why this is important to the Android Ecosystem\nWhile certifications are a great form of third party validation, they often fall under what we like to call the 3 C\u2019s:hundreds of individual tests\nWe have been working these last three years to reduce this complexity for our OEM partners. We are excited to tell you that the features required to satisfy the necessary security requirements are baked directly into the Android Open Source Project. We\u2019ve also added all of the management and auditability requirements into the Android Enterprise Management framework. Last year we started publishing the tools we have developed for this on GitHub to allow other Android OEMs to take advantage of our efforts as they go through their certification.GitHub\nWhile we continue certifying Pixel smartphones with new Android OS versions, we have worked to enable other Android OEMs to achieve this certification as well as others, such as:National Institute of Technology\u2019sCryptographic AlgorithmModule Validation ProgramsCertificate #3753US Department of Defense's Security Technical Implementation Guide\nWe\u2019ll continue to invest in additional ways to measure security for both enterprises and consumers, and we welcome the industry to join us in this effort.\n                        Google",

      "date": "February 5, 2021",
      "abstract": "Launching OSV - Better vulnerability triage for open sourceWe are excited to launch OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities), our first step towards improving vulnerability triage for developers and consumers of open source software. The goal of OSV is to provide precise data on where a vulnerability was introduced and where it got fixed, thereby helping consumers of open source software accurately identify if they are impacted and then make security fixes as quickly as possible. We have started OSV with a data set of fuzzing vulnerabilities found by the OSS-Fuzz service. OSV project evolved from our recent efforts to improve vulnerability management in open source (\"Know, Prevent, Fix\" framework).OSVOSS-Fuzz\"Know, Prevent, Fix\" frameworkVulnerability management can be painful for both consumers and maintainers of open source software, with tedious manual work involved in many cases.For consumers of open source software, it is often difficult to map a vulnerability such as a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entry to the package versions they are using. This comes from the fact that versioning schemes in existing vulnerability standards (such as Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)) do not map well with the actual open source versioning schemes, which are typically versions/tags and commit hashes. The result is missed vulnerabilities that affect downstream consumers.Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)Similarly, it is time consuming for maintainers to determine an accurate list of affected versions or commits across all their branches for downstream consumers after a vulnerability is fixed, in addition to the process required for publication. Unfortunately, many open source projects, including ones that are critical to modern infrastructure, are under resourced and overworked. Maintainers don't always have the bandwidth to create and publish thorough, accurate information about their vulnerabilities even if they want to.including ones that are critical to modern infrastructureThese challenges result in open source consumers not incorporating important security fixes promptly. OSV aims to:OSVReduce the work required by maintainers to publish vulnerabilities, andImprove the accuracy of vulnerability queries for downstream consumers by providing precise vulnerability metadata in an easy-to-query database (complementing existing vulnerability databases).OSV aims to simplify the vulnerability reporting process for an open source package maintainer by accurately determining the list of affected versions and commits. This requires providing both the commits that introduce and fix the bugs. If that information is not available, OSV requires providing a reproduction test case and steps to generate an application build, and then it performs bisection to find these commits in an automated fashion. OSV takes care of the rest of the analysis to figure out impacted commit ranges (accounting for cherry picks) and versions/tags.bisectionHow OSV worksOSV automates the triage workflow for an open source package consumer by providing an API to query for vulnerabilities. A typical OSV workflow for a package consumer looks like the picture above:A package consumer sends a query to OSV with a package version or commit hash as input.\u00a0\u00a0curl -X POST -d \\\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'{\"commit\": \"6879efc2c1596d11a6a6ad296f80063b558d5e0f\"}' \\\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'https://api.osv.dev/v1/query?key=$API_KEY'\u00a0\u00a0curl -X POST -d \\\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'{\"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"package\": {\"name\": \"pkg\", \"ecosystem\": \"pypi\"}' \\\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'https://api.osv.dev/v1/query?key=$API_KEY'https://api.osv.dev/v1/query?key=$API_KEYOSV looks up the set of vulnerabilities affecting that particular version and returns a list of vulnerabilities impacting the package. The vulnerability metadata is returned in a machine-readable JSON format.machine-readable JSON formatThe package consumer uses this information to either cherry-pick security fixes (based on precise fix metadata) or update to a later version.OSV currently provides access to thousands of vulnerabilities from 380+ critical OSS projects integrated with OSS-Fuzz. We are planning to work with open source communities to extend with data from various language ecosystems (e.g. NPM, PyPI) and work out a pipeline for package maintainers to submit vulnerabilities with minimal work.380+ critical OSS projectsOSS-FuzzOur goal with OSV is to rethink and promote better, scalable vulnerability tracking for open source.

      "title": "Know, Prevent, Fix: A framework for shifting the discussion around vulnerabilities in open source",
      "date": "February 3, 2021",
      "abstract": "Know, Prevent, Fix: A framework for shifting the discussion around vulnerabilities in open source\nExecutive Summary:\nThe security of open source software has rightfully garnered the industry\u2019s attention, but solutions require consensus about the challenges and cooperation in the execution. The problem is complex and there are many facets to cover: supply chain, dependency management, identity, and build pipelines. Solutions come faster when the problem is well-framed; we propose a framework (\u201cKnow, Prevent, Fix\u201d) for how the industry can think about vulnerabilities in open source and concrete areas to address first, including:\nThe following framework and goals are proposed with the intention of sparking industry-wide discussion and progress on the security of open source software.\nDue to recent events, the software world gained a deeper understanding about the real risk of supply-chain attacks. Open source software should be less risky on the security front, as all of the code and dependencies are in the open and available for inspection and verification. And while that is generally true, it assumes people are actually looking. With so many dependencies, it is impractical to monitor them all, and many open source packages are not well maintained.recent events\nIt is common for a program to depend, directly or indirectly, on thousands of packages and libraries. For example, Kubernetes now depends on about 1,000 packages. Open source likely makes more use of dependencies than closed source, and from a wider range of suppliers; the number of distinct entities that need to be trusted can be very high. This makes it extremely difficult to understand how open source is used in products and what vulnerabilities might be relevant. There is also no assurance that what is built matches the source code.dependenciesvery high\nTaking a step back, although supply-chain attacks are a risk, the vast majority of vulnerabilities are mundane and unintentional\u2014honest errors made by well-intentioned developers. Furthermore, bad actors are more likely to exploit known vulnerabilities than to find their own: it\u2019s just easier. As such, we must focus on making fundamental changes to address the majority of vulnerabilities, as doing so will move the entire industry far along in addressing the complex cases as well, including supply-chain attacks.\nFew organizations can verify all of the packages they use, let alone all of the updates to those packages. In the current landscape, tracking these packages takes a non-trivial amount of infrastructure, and significant manual effort. At Google, we have those resources and go to extraordinary lengths to manage the open source packages we use\u2014including keeping a private repo of all open source packages we use internally\u2014and it is still challenging to track all of the updates. The sheer flow of updates is daunting. A core part of any solution will be more automation, and this will be a key theme for our open source security work in 2021 and beyond.\nBecause this is a complex problem that needs industry cooperation, our purpose here is to focus the conversation around concrete goals. Google co-founded the OpenSSF to be a focal point for this collaboration, but to make progress, we need participation across the industry, and agreement on what the problems are and how we might address them. To get the discussion started, we present one way to frame this problem, and a set of concrete goals that we hope will accelerate industry-wide solutions.OpenSSF\nWe suggest framing the challenge as three largely independent problem areas, each with concrete objectives:\nA related but separate problem, which is critical to securing the supply chain, is improving the security of the development process. We\u2019ve outlined the challenges of this problem and proposed goals in the fourth section, Prevention for Critical Software.\nKnowing your vulnerabilities is harder than expected for many reasons. Although there are mechanisms for reporting vulnerabilities, it is hard to know if they actually affect the specific versions of software you are using.\nGoal: Precise Vulnerability Data\nFirst, it is crucial to capture precise vulnerability metadata from all available data sources. For example, knowing which version introduced a vulnerability helps determine if one's software is affected, and knowing when it was fixed results in accurate and timely patching (and a reduced window for potential exploitation). Ideally, this triaging workflow should be automated.\nSecond, most vulnerabilities are in your dependencies, rather than the code you write or control directly. Thus, even when your code is not changing, there can be a constant churn in your vulnerabilities: some get fixed and others get added.11\nGoal: Standard Schema for Vulnerability Databases\nInfrastructure and industry standards are needed to track and maintain open source vulnerabilities, understand their consequences, and manage their mitigations. A standard vulnerability schema would allow common tools to work across multiple vulnerability databases and simplify the task of tracking, especially when vulnerabilities touch multiple languages or subsystems.\nGoal: Accurate Tracking of Dependencies\nBetter tooling is needed to understand quickly what software is affected by a newly discovered vulnerability, a problem made harder by the scale and dynamic nature of large dependency trees. Current practices also often make it difficult to predict exactly what versions are used without actually doing an installation, as the software for version resolution is only available through the installer.\nIt would be ideal to prevent vulnerabilities from ever being created, and although testing and analysis tools can help, prevention will always be a hard problem. Here we focus on two specific aspects:\nGoal: Understand the Risks for New Dependencies\nThe first category is essentially knowing about vulnerabilities at the time you decide to use a package. Taking on a new dependency has inherent risk and it needs to be an informed decision. Once you have a dependency, it generally becomes harder to remove over time.\nKnowing about vulnerabilities is a great start, but there is more that we can do.\nMany vulnerabilities arise from lack of adherence to security best practices in software development processes. Are all contributors using two-factor authentication (2FA)? Does the project have continuous integration set up and running tests? Is fuzzing integrated? These are the types of security checks that would help consumers understand the risks they\u2019re taking on with new dependencies. Packages with a low \u201cscore\u201d warrant a closer review, and a plan for remediation.\nThe recently announced Security Scorecards project from OpenSSF attempts to generate these data points in a fully automated way. Using scorecards can also help defend against prevalent typosquatting attacks (malevolent packages with names similar to popular packages), since they would score much lower and fail many security checks.Security Scorecardsprevalent typosquatting attacks\nImproving the development processes for critical software is related to vulnerability prevention, but deserves its own discussion further down in our post.\nThe general problem of fixing vulnerabilities is beyond our scope, but there is much we can do for the specific problem of managing vulnerabilities in software dependencies. Today there is little help on this front, but as we improve precision it becomes worthwhile to invest in new processes and tooling.\nOne option of course is to fix the vulnerability directly. If you can do this in a backwards-compatible way, then the fix is available for everyone. But a challenge is that you are unlikely to have expertise on the problem, nor the direct ability to make changes. Fixing a vulnerability also assumes the software maintainers are aware of the issue, and have the knowledge and resources for vulnerability disclosure.\nConversely, if you simply remove the dependency that contains the vulnerability, then it is fixed for you and those that import or use your software, but not for anyone else. This is a change that is under your direct control.\nThese scenarios represent the two ends of the chain of dependencies between your software and the vulnerability, but in practice there can be many intervening packages. The general hope is that someone along that dependency chain will fix it. Unfortunately, fixing a link is not enough: Every link of the dependency chain between you and the vulnerability needs to be updated before your software will be fixed. Each link must include the fixed version of the thing below it to purge the vulnerability. Thus, the updates need to be done from the bottom up, unless you can eliminate the dependency altogether, which may require similar heroics and is rarely possible\u2014but is the best solution when it is.\nGoal: Understand your Options to Remove Vulnerabilities\nToday, we lack clarity on this process: what progress has been made by others and what upgrades should be applied at what level? And where is the process stuck? Who is responsible for fixing the vulnerability itself? Who is responsible for propagating the fix?\nGoal: Notifications to Speed Repairs\nEventually, your dependencies will be fixed and you can locally upgrade to the new versions. Knowing when this happens is an important goal as it accelerates reducing the exposure to vulnerabilities. We also need a notification system for the actual discovery of vulnerabilities; often new vulnerabilities represent latent problems that are newly discovered even though the actual code has not changed (such as this 10-year old vulnerability in the Unix utility sudo). For large projects, most such issues will arise in the indirect dependencies. Today, we lack the precision required to do notification well, but as we improve vulnerability precision and metadata (as above), we should also drive notification.10-year old vulnerability in the Unix utility sudo\nSo far, we have only described the easy case: a sequence of upgrades that are all backwards compatible, implying that the behavior is the same except for the absence of the vulnerability.\nIn practice, an upgrade is often not backward compatible, or is blocked by restrictive version requirements. These issues mean that updating a package deep in the dependency tree must cause some churn, or at least requirement updates, in the things above it. The situation often arises when the fix is made to the latest version, say 1.3, but your software or intervening packages request 1.2. We see this situation often, and it remains a big challenge that is made even harder by the difficulty of getting owners to update intervening packages. Moreover, if you use a package in a thousand places, which is not crazy for a big enterprise, you might need to go through the update process a thousand times.version\nGoal: Fix the Widely Used Versions\nIt\u2019s also important to fix the vulnerability in the older versions, especially those in heavy use. Such repair is common practice for the subset of software that has long-term support, but ideally all widely used versions should be fixed, especially for security risks.\nAutomation could help: given a fix for one version, perhaps we can generate good candidate fixes for other versions. This process is sometimes done by hand today, but if we can make it significantly easier, more versions will actually get patched, and there will be less work to do higher in the chain.\nTo summarize, we need ways to make fixing vulnerabilities, especially in dependencies, both easier and more timely. We need to increase the chance that there is a fix for widely used versions and not just for the latest version, which is often hard to adopt due to the other changes it includes.\nFinally, there are many other options on the \u201cfixing\u201d front, including various kinds of mitigations, such as avoiding certain methods, or limiting risk through sandboxes or access controls. These are important practical options that need more discussion and support.\nThe framing above applies broadly to vulnerabilities, regardless of whether they are due to bad actors or are merely innocent mistakes. Although the suggested goals cover most vulnerabilities, they are not sufficient to prevent malicious behavior. To have a meaningful impact on prevention for bad actors, including supply-chain attacks, we need to improve the processes used for development.\nThis is a big task, and currently unrealistic for the majority of open source. Part of the beauty of open source is its lack of constraints on the process, which encourages a wide range of contributors. However, that flexibility can hinder security considerations. We want contributors, but we cannot expect everyone to be equally focused on security. Instead, we must identify critical packages and protect them. Such critical packages must be held to a range of higher development standards, even though that might add developer friction.\nGoal: Define Criteria for \u201cCritical\u201d Open Source Projects that Merit Higher Standards\nIt is important to identify the \u201ccritical\u201d packages that we all depend upon and whose compromise would endanger critical infrastructure or user privacy. These packages need to be held to higher standards, some of which we outline below.\nIt is not obvious how to define \u201ccritical\u201d and the definition will likely expand over time. Beyond obvious software, such as OpenSSL or key cryptographic libraries, there are widely used packages where their sheer reach makes them worth protecting. We started the Criticality Score project to brainstorm this problem with the community, as well collaborating with Harvard on the Open Source Census efforts.Criticality Score project\nGoal: No Unilateral Changes to Critical Software\nOne principle that we follow across Google is that changes should not be unilateral\u2014that is, every change involves at least an author and a reviewer or approver. The goal is to limit what an adversary can do on their own\u2014we need to make sure someone is actually looking at the changes. To do this well for open source is actually quite a bit harder than just within a single company, which can have strong authentication and enforce code reviews and other checks.\nAvoiding unilateral changes can be broken down into two sub-goals:\nGoal: Require Code Review for Critical Software\n\n    Besides being a great process for improving code, reviews ensure that at least one person other than the author is looking at every change. Code reviews are a standard practice for all changes within Google.\nGoal: Changes to Critical Software Require Approval by Two Independent Parties\n\n    To really achieve the \u201csomeone is looking\u201d goal, we need the reviewer to be independent from the contributor. And for critical changes, we probably want more than one independent review. We need to sort out what counts as \u201cindependent\u201d review, of course, but the idea of independence is fundamental to reviews in most industries.\nGoal: Authentication for Participants in Critical Software\nAny notion of independence also implies that you know the actors\u2014an anonymous actor cannot be assumed to be independent or trustworthy. Today, we essentially have pseudonyms: the same person uses an identity repeatedly and thus can have a reputation, but we don\u2019t always know the individual\u2019s trustworthiness. This leads to a range of subgoals:\nGoal: For Critical Software, Owners and Maintainers Cannot be Anonymous\n\n    Attackers like to have anonymity. There have been past supply-chain attacks where attackers capitalized on anonymity and worked their way through package communities to become maintainers, without anyone realizing this \u201cnew maintainer\u201d had malicious intent (compromising source code was eventually injected upstream). To mitigate this risk, our view is that owners and maintainers of critical software must not be anonymous.\n\n    It is conceivable that contributors, unlike owners and maintainers, could be anonymous, but only if their code has passed multiple reviews by trusted parties.\n\n    It is also conceivable that we could have \u201cverified\u201d identities, in which a trusted entity knows the real identity, but for privacy reasons the public does not. This would enable decisions about independence as well as prosecution for illegal behavior.\nGoal: Strong Authentication for Contributors of Critical Software\n\n    Malicious actors look for easy attack vectors, so phishing attacks and other forms of theft related to credentials are common. One obvious improvement would be the required use of two-factor authentication, especially for owners and maintainers.\nGoal: A Federated Model for Identities\n\n    To continue the inclusive nature of open source, we need to be able to trust a wide range of identities, but still with verified integrity. This implies a federated model for identities, perhaps similar to how we support federated SSL certificates today\u2014a range of groups can generate valid certificates, but with strong auditing and mutual oversight.\nDiscussions on this topic are starting to take place in the OpenSSF\u2019s Digital Identity Attestation Working Group.DiscussionsDigital Identity Attestation Working Group\nGoal: Notification for Changes in Risk\nWe should extend notifications to cover changes in risk. The most obvious is ownership changes, which can be a prelude to new attacks (such as the recent NPM event-stream compromise). Other examples include discovery of stolen credentials, collusion, or other bad actor behavior.event-stream compromise\nGoal: Transparency for Artifacts\nIt is common to use secure hashes to detect if an artifact has arrived intact, and digital signatures to prove authenticity. Adding \u201ctransparency\u201d means that these attestations are logged publicly and thus document what was intended. In turn, external parties can monitor the logs for fake versions even if users are unaware. Going a step further, when credentials are stolen, we can know what artifacts were signed using those credentials and work to remove them. This kind of transparency, including the durable public logs and the third-party monitoring, has been used to great success for SSL certificates, and we have proposed one way to do this for package managers. Knowing you have the right package or binary is similar to knowing you are visiting the real version of a web site.SSL certificatesproposed\nGoal: Trust the Build Process\nKen Thompson's Turing Award lecture famously demonstrated in 1984 that authentic source code alone is not enough, and recent events have shown this attack is a real threat. How do you trust your build system? All the components of it must be trusted and verified through a continuous process of building trust.lecturerecent events\nReproducible builds help\u2014there is a deterministic outcome for the build and we can thus verify that we got it right\u2014but are harder to achieve due to ephemeral data (such as timestamps) ending up in the release artifact. And safe reproducible builds require verification tools, which in turn must be built verifiably and reproducibly, and so on. We must construct a network of trusted tools and build products.\nTrust in both the artifacts and the tools can be established via \u201cdelegation\u201d, through a variant of the transparency process described above called binary authorization. Internally, the Google build system signs all artifacts and produces a manifest that ties it to the source code. For open source, one or more trusted agents could run the build as a service, signing the artifact to prove that they are accountable for its integrity. This kind of ecosystem should exist and mostly needs awareness and some agreements on the format of attestations, so that we can automate the processes securely.binary authorization\nThe actions in this section are great for software in general, and are essentially in use today within Google, but they are heavier weight than usual for open source. Our hope is that by focusing on the subset of software that is critical, we can achieve these goals at least for that set. As the tooling and automation get better, these goals will become easier to adopt more widely.\nThe nature of open source requires that we solve problems through consensus and collaboration. For complex topics such as vulnerabilities, this implies focused discussion around the key issues. We presented one way to frame this discussion, and defined a set of goals that we hope will accelerate industry-wide discourse and the ultimate solutions. The first set of goals apply broadly to vulnerabilities and are really about enabling automation and reducing risk and toil.However, these goals are not enough in the presence of adversaries or to prevent \u201csupply chain\u201d attacks. Thus we propose a second set of goals for critical software. The second set is more onerous and therefore will meet some resistance, but we believe the extra constraints are fundamental for security. The intention is to define collectively the set of \u201ccritical\u201d software packages, and apply these higher standards only to this set.Although we have various opinions on how to meet both sets of goals, we are but one voice in a space where consensus and sustainable solutions matter most of all. We look forward to this discussion, to promoting the best ideas, and eventually to solutions that both strengthen and streamline the security of open source that we all depend on.\n     Ideally, depended-upon versions should be stable absent an explicit upgrade, but behavior varies depending on the packaging system. Two that aim for stability rather than fast upgrades are Go Modules and NuGet, both of which by default install upgrades only when the requirements are updated; the dependencies might be wrong, but they only change with explicit updates.\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\n                        Google",

      "title": "Data Driven Security Hardening in Android",
      "date": "January 29, 2021",
      "abstract": "Data Driven Security Hardening in Android\nThe Android platform team is committed to securing Android for every user across every device. In addition to monthly security updates to patch vulnerabilities reported to us through our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP), we also proactively architect Android to protect against undiscovered vulnerabilities through hardening measures such as applying compiler-based mitigations and improving sandboxing. This post focuses on the decision-making process that goes into these proactive measures: in particular, how we choose which hardening techniques to deploy and where they are deployed. As device capabilities vary widely within the Android ecosystem, these decisions must be made carefully, guided by data available to us to maximize the value to the ecosystem as a whole.monthly security updatesVulnerability Rewards Program (VRP)compiler-based mitigations\nThe overall approach to Android Security is multi-pronged and leverages several principles and techniques to arrive at data-guided solutions to make future exploitation more difficult. In particular, when it comes to hardening the platform, we try to answer the following questions:\nBy shedding some light on the process we use to choose security features for Android, we hope to provide a better understanding of Android's overall approach to protecting our users.\nWe use a variety of sources to determine what areas of the platform would benefit the most from different types of security mitigations. The Android Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) is one very informative source: all vulnerabilities submitted through this program are analyzed by our security engineers to determine the root cause of each vulnerability and its overall severity (based on these guidelines). Other sources are internal and external bug-reports, which identify vulnerable components and reveal coding practices that commonly lead to errors. Knowledge of problematic code patterns combined with the prevalence and severity of the vulnerabilities they cause can help inform decisions about which mitigations are likely to be the most beneficial.Android Vulnerability Rewards Programthese guidelinesTypes of Critical and High severity vulnerabilities fixed in Android Security Bulletins in 2019\nRelying purely on vulnerability reports is not sufficient as the data are inherently biased: often, security researchers flock to \"hot\" areas, where other researchers have already found vulnerabilities (e.g. Stagefright). Or they may focus on areas where readily-available tools make it easier to find bugs (for instance, if a security research tool is posted to Github, other researchers commonly utilize that tool to explore deeper).Stagefright\nTo ensure that mitigation efforts are not biased only toward areas where bugs and vulnerabilities have been reported, internal Red Teams analyze less scrutinized or more complex parts of the platform. Also, continuous automated fuzzers run at-scale on both Android virtual machines and physical devices. This also ensures that bugs can be found and fixed early in the development lifecycle. Any vulnerabilities uncovered through this process are also analyzed for root cause and severity, which inform mitigation deployment decisions.\nThe Android VRP rewards submissions of full exploit-chains that demonstrate a full end-to-end attack. These exploit-chains, which generally utilize multiple vulnerabilities, are very informative in demonstrating techniques that attackers use to chain vulnerabilities together to accomplish their goals. Whenever a researcher submits a full exploit chain, a team of security engineers analyzes and documents the overall approach, each link in the chain, and any innovative attack strategies used. This analysis informs which exploit mitigation strategies could be employed to prevent pivoting directly from one vulnerability to another (some examples include Address Space Layout Randomization and Control-Flow Integrity) and whether the process\u2019s attack surface could be reduced if it has unnecessary access to resources.full exploit-chainsAddress Space Layout RandomizationControl-Flow Integrity\nThere are often multiple different ways to use a collection of vulnerabilities to create an exploit chain. Therefore a defense-in-depth approach is beneficial, with the goal of reducing the usefulness of some vulnerabilities and lengthening exploit chains so that successful exploitation requires more vulnerabilities. This increases the cost for an attacker to develop a full exploit chain.\nKeeping up with developments in the wider security community helps us understand the current threat landscape, what techniques are currently used for exploitation, and what future trends look like. This involves but is not limited to:KSPP\nAll of these data sources provide feedback for the overall security hardening strategy, where new mitigations should be deployed, and what existing security mitigations should be improved.\nAnalyzing the data reveals areas where broader mitigations can eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities.  For instance, if parts of the platform show a large number of vulnerabilities due to integer overflow bugs, they are good candidates to enable Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan) mitigations such as the Integer Overflow Sanitizer.  When common patterns in memory access vulnerabilities appear, they inform efforts to build hardened memory allocators (enabled by default in Android 11) and implement mitigations (such as CFI) against exploitation techniques that provide better resilience against memory overflows or Use-After-Free vulnerabilities.UBSanhardened memory allocatorsAndroid 11CFI\nBefore discussing how the data can be used, it is important to understand how we classify our overall efforts in hardening the platform. There are a few broadly defined buckets that hardening techniques and mitigations fit into (though sometimes a particular mitigation may not fit cleanly into any single one):Integer SanitizerBounds Sanitizeruninitialized memoryAndroid PermissionsUnix PermissionsLinux CapabilitiesSELinuxSeccompmajority\nWith the broad arsenal of mitigation techniques available, which of these to employ and where to apply them depends on the type of problem being solved. For instance, a monolithic process that handles a lot of untrusted data and does complex parsing would be a good candidate for all of these. The media frameworks provide an excellent historical example where an architectural decomposition enabled incrementally turning on more exploit mitigations and deprivileging.Architectural decomposition and isolation of the Media Frameworks over time\nRemotely reachable attack surfaces such as NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi, and media components have historically housed the most severe vulnerabilities, and as such these components are also prioritized for hardening. These components often contain some of the most common vulnerability root causes that are reported in the VRP, and we have recently enabled sanitizers in all of them.\nLibraries and processes that enforce or sit at security boundaries, such as libbinder, and widely-used core libraries such as libui, libcore, and libcutils are good targets for exploit mitigations since these are not process-specific. However, due to performance and stability sensitivities around these core libraries, mitigations need to be supported by strong evidence of their security impact.libbinderlibuilibcorelibcutils\nFinally, the kernel\u2019s high level of privilege makes it an important target for hardening as well. Because different codebases have different characteristics and functionality, susceptibility to and prevalence of certain kinds of vulnerabilities will differ. Stability and performance of mitigations here are exceptionally important to avoid negatively impacting the user experience, and some mitigations that make sense to deploy in user space may not be applicable or effective. Therefore our considerations for which hardening strategies to employ in the kernel are based on a separate analysis of the available kernel-specific data.\nThis data-driven approach has led to tangible and measurable results. Starting in 2015 with Stagefright, a large number of Critical severity vulnerabilities were reported in Android's media framework. These were especially sensitive because many of these vulnerabilities were remotely reachable. This led to a large architectural decomposition effort in Android Nougat, followed by additional efforts to improve our ability to patch media vulnerabilities quickly. Thanks to these changes, in 2020 we had no internet-reachable Critical severity vulnerabilities reported to us in the media frameworks.Critical severitya large architectural decomposition effort in Android Nougatimprove our ability to patch media vulnerabilities quickly\nSome of these mitigations provide more value than others, so it is important to focus engineering resources where they are most effective. This involves weighing the performance cost of each mitigation as well as how much work is required to deploy it and support it without negatively affecting device stability or user experience.\nUnderstanding the performance impact of a mitigation is a critical step toward enabling it. Adding too much overhead to some components or the entire system can negatively impact user experience by reducing battery life and making the device less responsive. This is especially true for entry-level devices, which should benefit from hardening as well. We thus want to prioritize engineering efforts on impactful mitigations with acceptable overheads.\nWhen investigating performance, important factors include not just CPU time but also memory increase, code size, battery life, and UI jank. These factors are especially important to consider for more constrained entry-level devices, to ensure that the mitigations perform well across the entire Android ecosystem.UI jank\nThe system-wide performance impact of a mitigation is also dependent on where that mitigation is enabled, as certain components are more performance-sensitive than others. For example, binder is one of the most used paths for interprocess communication, so even small additional overhead could significantly impact user experience on a device. On the other hand, video players only need to ensure that frames are rendered at the source framerate; if frames are rendered much faster than the rate at which they are displayed, additional overhead may be more acceptable.\nBenchmarks, if available, can be extremely useful to evaluate the performance impact of a mitigation. If there are no benchmarks for a certain component, new ones should be created, for instance by calling impacted codec code to decode a media file. If this testing reveals unacceptable overhead, there are often a few options to address it:HereIntegerOverflowBoundstunable parameters\nMost of these improvements involve changes or contributions to the LLVM project. By working with upstream LLVM, these improvements have impact and benefit beyond Android. At the same time Android benefits from upstream improvements when others in the LLVM community make improvements as well.\nThere is more to consider when enabling a mitigation than its security benefit and performance cost, such as the cost of short-term deployment and long-term support.\nOne important issue is whether a mitigation can contain false positives. For example, if the Bounds Sanitizer produces an error, there is definitely an out-of-bounds access (although it might not be exploitable). But the Integer Overflow Sanitizer can produce false positives, as many integer overflows are harmless or even perfectly expected and correct.\nIt is thus important to consider the impact of a mitigation on the stability of the system. Whether a crash is due to a false positive or a legitimate security issue, it still disrupts the user experience and so is undesirable. This is another reason to carefully consider which components should have which mitigations, as crashes in some components are worse than others. If a mitigation causes a crash in a media codec, the user\u2019s video playback will be stopped, but if netd crashes during an update, the phone could be bricked. For a mitigation like Bounds Sanitizer, where false positives are not an issue, we still need to perform extensive testing to ensure the device remains stable. Off-by-one errors, for example, may not crash during normal operation, but Bounds Sanitizer would abort execution and result in instability.\nAnother consideration is whether it is possible to enumerate everything a mitigation might break. For example, it is not easy to contain the risk of the Integer Overflow Sanitizer without extensive testing, as it is difficult to determine which overflows are intentional/benign (and thus should be allowed) and which could lead to vulnerabilities.\nWe must consider not just issues caused by deploying mitigations but also how to support them long-term. This includes the developer time to integrate a mitigation into existing systems, enable and debug it, deploy it onto devices, and support it after launch. SELinux is a good example of this; it takes a significant amount of effort to write the policy for a new device, and even once enforcing mode is enabled, the policy must be supported for years as code changes and functionality is added or removed.\nWe try to make mitigations less disruptive and spread awareness of how they affect developers. This is done by making documentation available on source.android.com and by improving existing algorithms to reduce false positives. Making it easier to debug mitigations when something goes wrong reduces the developer maintenance burden that can accompany mitigations. For example, when developers found it difficult to identify UBSan errors, we enabled support for the UBSan Minimal Runtime by default in the Android build system. The minimal runtime itself was first upstreamed by others at Google specifically for this purpose. When the Integer Overflow Sanitizer crashes a program, that adds the following hint to the generic SIGABRT crash message:source.android.comsupportupstreamed\nDevelopers who see this message then know to enable diagnostics mode, which prints out details about the crash:enable diagnostics mode\nSimilarly, upstream SELinux provides a tool called audit2allow that can be used to suggest rules to allow blocked behaviors:\nA debugging tool does not need to be perfect to be helpful; audit2allow does not always suggest the correct options, but for developers without detailed knowledge of SELinux it provides a strong starting point.\nWith every Android release, our team works hard to balance security improvements that benefit the entire ecosystem with performance and stability, drawing heavily from the data that are available to us. We hope that this sheds some light on the particular challenges involved and the overall process that leads to mitigations introduced in each Android release.\n                        Google\nandroid\nandroid security",

      "date": "December 9, 2020",
      "abstract": "How the Atheris Python Fuzzer WorksannouncedAtheris Python fuzzing enginelibFuzzerimport sysdef TestOneInput(data):\u00a0 # Our entry point\u00a0\u00a0if data == b\"bad\":\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0raise RuntimeError(\"Badness!\")atheris.Setup(sys.argv, TestOneInput)atheris.Fuzz()Atheris is a native Python extension, and uses libFuzzer to provide its code coverage and input generation capabilities. The entry point passed to atheris.Setup() is wrapped in the C++ entry point that\u2019s actually passed to libFuzzer. This wrapper will then be invoked by libFuzzer repeatedly, with its data proxied back to Python.libFuzzerPython Code CoverageAtheris is a native Python extension, and is typically compiled with libFuzzer linked in. When you initialize Atheris, it registers a tracer with CPython to collect information about Python code flow. This tracer can keep track of every line reached and every function executed.tracerWe need to get this trace information to libFuzzer, which is responsible for generating code coverage information. There\u2019s a problem, however: libFuzzer assumes that the amount of code is known at compile-time. The two primary code coverage mechanisms are __sanitizer_cov_pcs_init (which registers a set of program counters that might be visited) and __sanitizer_cov_8bit_counters_init (which registers an array of booleans that are to be incremented when a basic block is visited). Both of these need to know at initialization time how many program counters or basic blocks exist. But in Python, that isn\u2019t possible, since code isn\u2019t loaded until well after Python starts. We can\u2019t even know it when we start the fuzzer: it\u2019s possible to dynamically import code later, or even generate code on the fly.Thankfully, libFuzzer supports fuzzing shared libraries loaded at runtime. Both __sanitizer_cov_pcs_init and __sanitizer_cov_8bit_counters_init are able to be safely called from a shared library in its constructor (called when the library is loaded). So, Atheris simulates loading shared libraries! When tracing is initialized, Atheris first calls those functions with an array of 8-bit counters and completely made-up program counters. Then, whenever a new Python line is reached, Atheris allocates a PC and 8-bit counter to that line; Atheris will always report that line the same way from then on. Once Atheris runs out of PCs and 8-bit counters, it simply loads a new \u201cshared library\u201d by calling those functions again. Of course, exponential growth is used to ensure that the number of shared libraries doesn\u2019t become excessive.What's Special about Python 3.8+?In the README, we advise users to use Python 3.8+ where possible. This is because Python 3.8 added a new feature: opcode tracing. Not only can we monitor when every line is visited and every function is called, but we can actually monitor every operation that Python performs, and what arguments it uses. This allows Atheris to find its way through if statements much better.READMEWhen a COMPARE_OP opcode is encountered, indicating a boolean comparison between two values, Atheris inspects the types of the values.

      "abstract": "Announcing Bonus Rewards for V8 Exploits\nStarting today, the Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program is offering a new bonus for reports which demonstrate exploitability in V8, Chrome\u2019s JavaScript engine. We have historically had many great V8 bugs reported (thank you to all of our reporters!) but we'd like to know more about the exploitability of different V8 bug classes, and what mechanisms are effective to go from an initial bug to a full exploit. That's why we're offering this additional reward for bugs that show how a V8 vulnerability could be used as part of a real world attack.V8\nIn the past, exploits had to be fully functional to be rewarded at our highest tier, high-quality report with functional exploit. Demonstration of how a bug might be exploited is one factor that the panel may use to determine that a report is high-quality, our second highest tier, but we want to encourage more of this type of analysis. This information is very useful for us when planning future mitigations, making release decisions, and fixing bugs faster. We also know it requires a bit more effort for our reporters, and that effort should be rewarded. For the time being this only applies to V8 bugs, but we\u2019re curious to see what our reporters come up with!\nThe full details are available on the Chrome VRP rules page. At a high-level, we\u2019re offering increased reward amounts, up to double, for qualifying V8 bugs.Chrome VRP rules page\nThe following table shows the updated reward amounts for reports qualifying for this new bonus. These new, higher values replace the normal reward. If a bug in V8 doesn\u2019t fit into one of these categories, it may still qualify for an increased reward at the panel\u2019s discretion.\nSo what does a report need to do to demonstrate that a bug is likely exploitable? Any V8 bug report which would have previously been rewarded at the high-quality report with functional exploit level will likely qualify with no additional effort from the reporter. By definition, these demonstrate that the issue was exploitable. V8 reports at the high-quality level may also qualify if they include evidence that the bug is exploitable as part of their analysis. See the rules page for more information about our reward levels.rules page\nThe following are some examples of how a report could demonstrate that exploitation is likely, but any analysis or proof of concept will be considered by the panel:d8\nFor example reports, see issues 914736 and 1076708.9147361076708\nWe\u2019d like to thank all of our VRP reporters for helping us keep Chrome users safe!

      "title": "Privacy-preserving features in the Mobile Driving License",
      "date": "October 28, 2020",
      "abstract": "Privacy-preserving features in the Mobile Driving License\nIn the United States and other countries a Driver's License is not only used to convey driving privileges, it is also commonly used to prove identity or personal details.Driver's License\nPresenting a Driving License is simple, right? You hand over the card to the individual wishing to confirm your identity (the so-called \u201cRelying Party\u201d or \u201cVerifier\u201d); they check the security features of the plastic card (hologram, micro-printing, etc.) to ensure it\u2019s not counterfeit; they check that it\u2019s really your license, making sure you look like the portrait image printed on the card; and they read the data they\u2019re interested in, typically your age, legal name, address etc. Finally, the verifier needs to hand back the plastic card.security features of the plastic card\nMost people are so familiar with this process that they don\u2019t think twice about it, or consider the privacy implications. In the following we\u2019ll discuss how the new and soon-to-be-released ISO 18013-5 standard will improve on nearly every aspect of the process, and what it has to do with Android.ISO 18013-5\nThe ISO 18013-5 \u201cMobile driving licence (mDL) application\u201d standard has been written by a diverse group of people representing driving license issuers (e.g. state governments in the US), relying parties (federal and state governments, including law enforcement), academia, industry (including Google), and many others. This ISO standard allows for construction of Mobile Driving License (mDL) applications which users can carry in their phone and can use instead of the plastic card.ISO 18013-5 \u201cMobile driving licence (mDL) application\u201d\nInstead of handing over your plastic card, you open the mDL application on your phone and press a button to share your mDL. The Verifier (aka \u201cRelying Party\u201d) has their own device with an mDL reader application and they either scan a QR code shown in your mDL app or do an NFC tap. The QR code (or NFC tap) conveys an ephemeral cryptographic public key and hardware address the mDL reader can connect to.\nOnce the mDL reader obtains the cryptographic key it creates its own ephemeral keypair and establishes an encrypted and authenticated, secure wireless channel (BLE, Wifi Aware or NFC)). The mDL reader uses this secure channel to request data, such as the portrait image or what kinds of vehicles you're allowed to drive, and can also be used to ask more abstract questions such as \u201cis the holder older than 18?\u201dask more abstract questions\nCrucially, the mDL application can ask the user to approve which data to release and may require the user to authenticate with fingerprint or face \u2014 none of which a passive plastic card could ever do.\nWith this explanation in mind, let\u2019s see how presenting an mDL application compares with presenting a plastic-card driving license:lockdown mode2D barcode on the backcashier to scanyour licenseleak their whole database\nThese are some of the reasons why we think mDL is a big win for end users in terms of privacy.\nOne commonality between plastic-card driving licences and the mDL is how the relying party verifies that the person presenting the license is the authorized holder. In both cases, the verifier manually compares the appearance of the individual against a portrait photo, either printed on the plastic or transmitted electronically and research has shown that it\u2019s hard for individuals to match strangers to portrait images.research has shown\nThe initial version of ISO 18013-5 won\u2019t improve on this but the ISO committee working on the standard is already investigating ways to utilize on-device biometrics sensors to perform this match in a secure and privacy-protecting way. The hope is that improved fidelity in the process helps reduce unauthorized use of identity documents.\nThrough facilities such as hardware-based Keystore, Android already offers excellent support for security and privacy-sensitive applications and in fact it\u2019s already possible to implement the ISO 18013-5 standard on Android without further platform changes. Many organizations participating in the ISO committee have already implemented 18013-5 Android apps.ISO 18013-5\nThat said, with purpose-built support in the operating system it is possible to provide better security and privacy properties. Android 11 includes the Identity Credential APIs at the Framework level along with a Hardware Abstraction Layer interface which can be implemented by Android OEMs to enable identity credential support in Secure Hardware. Using the Identity Credential API, the Trusted Computing Base of mDL applications does not include the application or even Android itself. This will be particularly important for future versions where the verifier must trust the device to identify and authenticate the user, for example through fingerprint or face matching on the holder's own device. It\u2019s likely such a solution will require certified hardware and/or software and certification is not practical if the TCB includes the hundreds of millions of lines of code in Android and the Linux kernel.Identity Credential APIsHardware Abstraction Layer interfaceTrusted Computing Basecertified\nOne advantage of plastic cards is that they don't require power or network communication to be useful. Putting all your licenses on your phone could seem inconvenient in cases where your device is low on battery, or does not have enough battery life to start. The Android Identity Credential HAL therefore provides support for a mode called Direct Access, where the license is still available through an NFC tap even when the phone's battery is too low to boot it up. Device makers can implement this mode, but it will require hardware support that will take several years to roll out.\nFor devices without the Identity Credential HAL, we have an Android Jetpack which implements the same API and works on nearly every Android device in the world (API level 24 or later). If the device has hardware-backed Identity Credential support then this Jetpack simply forwards calls to the platform API. Otherwise, an Android Keystore-backed implementation will be used. While the Android Keystore-backed implementation does not provide the same level of security and privacy, it is perfectly adequate for both holders and issuers in cases where all data is issuer-signed. Because of this, the Jetpack is the preferred way to use the Identity Credential APIs. We also made available sample open-source mDL and mDL Reader applications using the Identity Credential APIs.Android Jetpack sample open-source mDL and mDL Reader applications\nAndroid now includes APIs for managing and presenting with identity documents in a more secure and privacy-focused way than was previously possible. These can be used to implement ISO 18013-5 mDLs but the APIs are generic enough to be usable for other kinds of electronic documents, from school ID or bonus program club cards to passports.\nAdditionally, the Android Security and Privacy team actively participates in the ISO committees where these standards are written and also works with civil liberties groups to ensure it has a positive impact on our end users.ensure it has a positive impact on our end users\n                        Google\nandroid security",

      "abstract": "Fuzzing internships for Open Source Software\nOpen source software is the foundation of many modern software products. Over the years, developers increasingly have relied on reusable open source components for their applications. It is paramount that these open source components are secure and reliable, as weaknesses impact those that build upon it.relied on\nGoogle cares deeply about the security of the open source ecosystem and recently launched the Open Source Security Foundation with other industry partners. Fuzzing is an automated testing technique to find bugs by feeding unexpected inputs to a target program. At Google, we leverage fuzzing at scale to find tens of thousands of security vulnerabilities and stability bugs. This summer, as part of Google\u2019s OSS internship initiative, we hosted 50 interns to improve the state of fuzz testing in the open source ecosystem.Open Source Security FoundationFuzzingGoogle\u2019s OSS internship initiative\nThe fuzzing interns worked towards integrating new projects and improving existing ones in OSS-Fuzz, our continuous fuzzing service for the open source community (which has 350+ projects, 22,700 bugs, 89% fixed). Several widely used open source libraries including but not limited to nginx, postgresql, usrsctp, and openexr, now have continuous fuzzing coverage as a result of these efforts.OSS-Fuzz350+22,700nginxpostgresqlusrsctpopenexr\nAnother group of interns focused on improving the security of the Linux kernel. syzkaller, a kernel fuzzing tool from Google, has been instrumental in finding kernel vulnerabilities in various operating systems. The interns were tasked with improving the fuzzing coverage by adding new descriptions to syzkaller like ip tunnels, io_uring, and bpf_lsm for example, refining the interface description language, and advancing kernel fault injection capabilities.Linux kernelsyzkallerfinding kernel vulnerabilitiesip tunnelsio_uringbpf_lsminterface description languagefault injection capabilities\nSome interns chose to write fuzzers for Android and Chrome, which are open source projects that billions of internet users rely on. For Android, the interns contributed several new fuzzers for uncovered areas - network protocols such as pppd and dns, audio codecs like monoblend, g722, and android framework. On the Chrome side, interns improved existing blackbox fuzzers, particularly in the areas: DOM, IPC, media, extensions, and added new libprotobuf-based fuzzers for Mojo.pppddnsmonoblendg722android frameworklibprotobuf-based fuzzers for Mojo\nOur last set of interns researched quite a few under-explored areas of fuzzing, some of which were fuzzer benchmarking, ML based fuzzing, differential fuzzing, bazel rules for build simplification and made useful contributions.fuzzer benchmarkingML based fuzzingdifferential fuzzingbazel rules for build simplification\nOver the course of the internship, our interns have reported over 150 security vulnerabilities and 750 functional bugs.

      "date": "October 7, 2020",
      "abstract": "Privacy-Preserving Smart Input with Gboard\nGoogle Keyboard (a.k.a Gboard) has a critical mission to provide frictionless input on Android to empower users to communicate accurately and express themselves effortlessly. In order to accomplish this mission, Gboard must also protect users' private and sensitive data. Nothing users type is sent to Google servers.  We recently launched privacy-preserving input by further advancing the latest federated technologies. In Android 11, Gboard also launched the contextual input suggestion experience by integrating on-device smarts into the user's daily communication in a privacy-preserving way.federated technologies\nBefore Android 11, input suggestions were surfaced to users in several different places. In Android 11, Gboard launched a consistent and coordinated approach to access contextual input suggestions. For the first time, we've brought Smart Replies to the keyboard suggestions - powered by system intelligence running entirely on device. The smart input suggestions are rendered with a transparent layer on top of Gboard\u2019s suggestion strip.  This structure maintains the trust boundaries between the Android platform and Gboard, meaning sensitive personal content cannot be not accessed by Gboard. The suggestions are only sent to the app after the user taps to accept them.\nFor instance, when a user receives the message \u201cHave a virtual coffee at 5pm?\u201d in Whatsapp, on-device system intelligence predicts smart text and emoji replies \u201cSounds great!\u201d and \u201c\ud83d\udc4d\u201d. Android system intelligence can see the incoming message but Gboard cannot. In Android 11, these Smart Replies are rendered by the Android platform on Gboard\u2019s suggestion strip as a transparent layer. The suggested reply is generated by the system intelligence. When the user taps the suggestion, Android platform sends it to the input field directly. If the user doesn't tap the suggestion, gBoard and the app cannot see it. In this way, Android and Gboard surface the best of Google smarts whilst keeping users' data private: none of their data goes to any app, including the keyboard, unless they've tapped a suggestion.\nAdditionally, federated learning has enabled Gboard to train intelligent input models across many devices while keeping everything individual users type on their device. Today, the emoji is as common as punctuation - and have become the way for our users to express themselves in messaging. Our users want a way to have fresh and diversified emojis to better express their thoughts in messaging apps. Recently, we launched new on-device transformer models that are fine-tuned with federated learning in Gboard, to produce more contextual emoji predictions for English, Spanish and Portuguese.federated learning\nFurthermore, following the success of privacy-preserving machine learning techniques, Gboard continues to leverage federated analytics to understand how Gboard is used from decentralized data. What we've learned from privacy-preserving analysis has let us make better decisions in our product.federated analytics\nWhen a user shares an emoji in a conversation, their phone keeps an ongoing count of which emojis are used. Later, when the phone is idle, plugged in, and connected to WiFi, Google\u2019s federated analytics server invites the device to join a \u201cround\u201d of federated analytics data computation with hundreds of other participating phones. Every device involved in one round will compute the emoji share frequency, encrypt the result and send it a federated analytics server. Although the server can\u2019t decrypt the data individually, the final tally of total emoji counts can be decrypted when combining encrypted data across devices. The aggregated data shows that the most popular emoji is \ud83d\ude02 in Whatsapp,  \ud83d\ude2d in Roblox(gaming), and \u2714 in Google Docs. Emoji \ud83d\ude37 moved up from 119th to 42nd in terms of frequency during COVID-19.federated analytics server\nGboard always has a strong commitment to Google\u2019s Privacy Principles. Gboard strives to build privacy-preserving effortless input products for users to freely express their thoughts in 900+ languages while safeguarding user data. We will keep pushing the state of the art in smart  input technologies on Android while safeguarding user data. Stay tuned!Privacy Principles\n                        Google\nandroid\nfederated learning\nGboard\nprivacy",

      "title": "Announcing the launch of the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative",
      "date": "October 2, 2020",
      "abstract": "Announcing the launch of the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative\nGoogle\u2019s Android Security & Privacy team has launched the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative (APVI) to manage security issues specific to Android OEMs. The APVI is designed to drive remediation and provide transparency to users about issues we have discovered at Google that affect device models shipped by Android partners.Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative\nAndroid incorporates industry-leading security features and every day we work with developers and device implementers to keep the Android platform and ecosystem safe. As part of that effort, we have a range of existing programs to enable security researchers to report security issues they have found. For example, you can report vulnerabilities in Android code via the Android Security Rewards Program (ASR), and vulnerabilities in popular third-party Android apps through the Google Play Security Rewards Program. Google releases ASR reports in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) based code through the Android Security Bulletins (ASB). These reports are issues that could impact all Android based devices. All Android partners must adopt ASB changes in order to declare the current month\u2019s Android security patch level (SPL). But until recently, we didn\u2019t have a clear way to process Google-discovered security issues outside of AOSP code that are unique to a much smaller set of specific Android OEMs. The APVI aims to close this gap, adding another layer of security for this targeted set of Android OEMs.Android Security Rewards ProgramGoogle Play Security Rewards ProgramAndroid Security Bulletins\nThe APVI covers Google-discovered issues that could potentially affect the security posture of an Android device or its user and is aligned to ISO/IEC 29147:2018 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Vulnerability disclosure recommendations. The initiative covers a wide range of issues impacting device code that is not serviced or maintained by Google (these are handled by the Android Security Bulletins).ISO/IEC 29147:2018\nThe APVI has already processed a number of security issues, improving user protection against permissions bypasses, execution of code in the kernel, credential leaks and generation of unencrypted backups. Below are a few examples of what we\u2019ve found, the impact and OEM remediation efforts.\nIn some versions of a third-party pre-installed over-the-air (OTA) update solution, a custom system service in the Android framework exposed privileged APIs directly to the OTA app. The service ran as the system user and did not require any permissions to access, instead checking for knowledge of a hardcoded password. The operations available varied across versions, but always allowed access to sensitive APIs, such as silently installing/uninstalling APKs, enabling/disabling apps and granting app permissions. This service appeared in the code base for many device builds across many OEMs, however it wasn\u2019t always registered or exposed to apps. We\u2019ve worked with impacted OEMs to make them aware of this security issue and provided guidance on how to remove or disable the affected code.\nA popular web browser pre-installed on many devices included a built-in password manager for sites visited by the user. The interface for this feature was exposed to WebView through JavaScript loaded in the context of each web page. A malicious site could have accessed the full contents of the user\u2019s credential store. The credentials are encrypted at rest, but used a weak algorithm (DES) and a known, hardcoded key. This issue was reported to the developer and updates for the app were issued to users.\nThe checkUidPermission method in the PackageManagerService class was modified in the framework code for some devices to allow special permissions access to some apps. In one version, the method granted apps with the shared user ID com.google.uid.shared any permission they requested and apps signed with the same key as the com.google.android.gsf package any permission in their manifest. Another version of the modification allowed apps matching a list of package names and signatures to pass runtime permission checks even if the permission was not in their manifest. These issues have been fixed by the OEMs.\nKeep an eye out at https://bugs.chromium.org/p/apvi/ for future disclosures of Google-discovered security issues under this program, or find more information there on issues that have already been disclosed.https://bugs.chromium.org/p/apvi/\nAcknowledgements: Scott Roberts, Shailesh Saini and \u0141ukasz Siewierski, Android Security and Privacy Team\n                        Google\nandroid\nandroid security\napp security\nvulnerabilities",

The team focuses on ensuring that Android devices respect the privacy and sensitivity of user data. A fundamental aspect of this work centers around the lockscreen, which acts as the proverbial front door to our devices. After all, the lockscreen ensures that only the intended user(s) of a device can access their private data.\nThis blog post outlines recent improvements around how users interact with the lockscreen on Android devices and more generally with authentication. In particular, we focus on two categories of authentication that present both immense potential as well as potentially immense risk if not designed well: biometrics and environmental modalities.\nBefore getting into the details of lockscreen and authentication improvements, we first want to establish some context to help relate these improvements to each other. A good way to envision these changes is to fit them into the framework of the tiered authentication model, a conceptual classification of all the different authentication modalities on Android, how they relate to each other, and how they are constrained based on this classification.\nThe model itself is fairly simple, classifying authentication modalities into three buckets of decreasing levels of security and commensurately increasing constraints. The primary tier is the least constrained in the sense that users only need to re-enter a primary modality under certain situations (for example, after each boot or every 72 hours) in order to use its capability. The secondary and tertiary tiers are more constrained because they cannot be set up and used without having a primary modality enrolled first and they have more constraints further restricting their capabilities.\n\n    Knowledge factors are especially useful on Android becauses devices offer hardware backed brute-force protection with exponential-backoff, meaning Android devices prevent attackers from repeatedly guessing a PIN, pattern, or password by having hardware backed timeouts after every 5 incorrect attempts. Knowledge factors also confer additional benefits to all users that use them, such as File Based Encryption (FBE) and encrypted device backup.File Based Encryptionencrypted device backup\n\tWe will delve into Android biometrics in the next section.\n\n    While both Trusted Places and Trusted Devices (and tertiary modalities in general) offer convenient ways to get access to the contents of your device, the fundamental issue they share is that they are ultimately a poor proxy for user identity. For example, an attacker could unlock a misplaced phone that uses Trusted Place simply by driving it past the user's home, or with moderate amount of effort, spoofing a GPS signal using off-the-shelf Software Defined Radios and some mild scripting. Similarly with Trusted Device, access to a safelisted bluetooth device also gives access to all data on the user\u2019s phone.\n\n    Because of this, a major improvement has been made to the environmental tier in Android 10. The Tertiary tier was switched from an active unlock mechanism into an extending unlock mechanism instead. In this new mode, a tertiary tier modality can no longer unlock a locked device. Instead, if the device is first unlocked using either a primary or secondary modality, it can continue to keep it in the unlocked state for a maximum of four hours.\nBiometric implementations come with a wide variety of security characteristics, so we rely on the following two key factors to determine the security of a particular implementation:Measuring Biometric Unlock Security\nWe use these two factors to classify biometrics into one of three different classes in decreasing order of security:\nEach class comes with an associated set of constraints that aim to balance their ease of use with the level of security they offer.\nThese constraints reflect the length of time before a biometric falls back to primary authentication, and the allowed application integration. For example, a Class 3 biometric enjoys the longest timeouts and offers all integration options for apps, while a Class 1 biometric has the shortest timeouts and no options for app integration. You can see a summary of the details in the table below, or the full details in the Android Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD).Android Android Compatibility Definition Document\n1 App integration means exposing an API to apps (e.g., via integration with BiometricPrompt/BiometricManager, androidx.biometric, or FIDO2 APIs)\n2 Keystore integration means integrating Keystore, e.g., to release app auth-bound keys\nBiometrics provide convenience to users while maintaining a high level of security. Because users need to set up a primary authentication modality in order to use biometrics, it helps boost the lockscreen adoption (we see an average of 20% higher lockscreen adoption on devices that offer biometrics versus those that do not). This allows more users to benefit from the security features that  the lockscreen provides: gates unauthorized access to sensitive user data and also confers other advantages of a primary authentication modality to these users, such as encrypted backups. Finally, biometrics also help reduce shoulder surfing attacks in which an attacker tries to reproduce a PIN, pattern, or password after observing a user entering the credential.\nHowever, it is important that users understand the trade-offs involved with the use of biometrics. Primary among these is that no biometric system is foolproof. This is true not just on Android, but across all operating systems, form-factors, and technologies. For example, a face biometric implementation might be fooled by family members who resemble the user or a 3D mask of the user. A fingerprint biometric implementation could potentially be bypassed by a spoof made from latent fingerprints of the user. Although anti-spoofing or Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) technologies have been actively developed to mitigate such spoofing attacks, they are mitigations, not preventions.\nOne effort that Android has made to mitigate the potential risk of using biometrics is the lockdown mode introduced in Android P. Android users can use this feature to temporarily disable biometrics, together with Smart Lock (for example, Trusted Places and Trusted Devices) as well as notifications on the lock screen, when they feel the need to do so.\nTo use the lockdown mode, users first need to set up a primary authentication modality and then enable it in settings. The exact setting where the lockdown mode can be enabled varies by device models, and on a Google Pixel 4 device it is under Settings > Display > Lock screen > Show lockdown option. Once enabled, users can trigger the lockdown mode by holding the power button and then clicking the Lockdown icon on the power menu. A device in lockdown mode will return to the non-lockdown state after a primary authentication modality (such as a PIN, pattern, or password) is used to unlock the device.\nIn order for developers to benefit from the security guarantee provided by Android biometrics and to easily integrate biometric authentication into their apps to better protect sensitive user data, we introduced the BiometricPrompt APIs in Android P.\nThere are several benefits of using the BiometricPrompt APIs. Most importantly, these APIs allow app developers to target biometrics in a modality-agnostic way across different Android devices (that is, BiometricPrompt can be used as a single integration point for various biometric modalities supported on devices), while controlling the security guarantees that the authentication needs to provide (such as requiring Class 3 or Class 2 biometrics, with device credential as a fallback). In this way, it helps protect app data with a second layer of defenses (in addition to the lockscreen) and in turn respects the sensitivity of user data. Furthermore, BiometricPrompt provides a persistent UI with customization options for certain information (for example, title and description), offering a consistent user experience across biometric modalities and across Android devices.\nAs shown in the following architecture diagram, apps can integrate with biometrics on Android devices through either the framework API or the support library (that is, androidx.biometric for backward compatibility). One thing to note is that FingerprintManager is deprecated because developers are encouraged to migrate to BiometricPrompt for modality-agnostic authentications.\nAndroid 10 introduced the BiometricManager class that developers can use to query the availability of biometric authentication and included fingerprint and face authentication integration for BiometricPrompt.BiometricManager\nIn Android 11, we introduce new features such as the BiometricManager.Authenticators interface which allows developers to specify the authentication types accepted by their apps, as well as additional support for auth-per-use keys within the BiometricPrompt class.\nMore details can be found in the Android 11 preview and Android Biometrics documentation.

While phone functionality and design can enhance the user experience, security is fundamental and foundational to our relationship with our phones.There are multiple ways to build trust around the security capabilities that a device provides and we continue to invest in verifiable ways to do just that.\nPixel 4a ioXt certification\nToday we are happy to announce that the Pixel 4/4 XL and the newly launched Pixel 4a are the first Android smartphones to go through ioXt certification against the Android Profile.Pixel 4/4 XLnewly launched Pixel 4aioXt certificationAndroid Profile.\nThe Internet of Secure Things Alliance (ioXt) manages a security compliance assessment program for connected devices. ioXt has over 200 members across various industries, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, T-Mobile, Comcast, Zigbee Alliance, Z-Wave Alliance, Legrand, Resideo, Schneider Electric, and many others. With so many companies involved, ioXt covers a wide range of device types, including smart lighting, smart speakers, webcams, and Android smartphones.Internet of Secure Things Alliance (ioXt)\nThe core focus of ioXt is \u201cto set security standards that bring security, upgradability and transparency to the market and directly into the hands of consumers.\u201d This is accomplished by assessing devices against a baseline set of requirements and relying on publicly available evidence.

      "date": "June 30, 2020",
      "abstract": "System hardening in Android 11In Android 11 we continue to increase the security of the Android platform.  We have moved to safer default settings, migrated to a hardened memory allocator, and expanded the use of compiler mitigations that defend against classes of vulnerabilities and frustrate exploitation techniques.\nWe\u2019ve enabled forms of automatic memory initialization in both Android 11\u2019s userspace and the Linux kernel. Uninitialized memory bugs occur in C/C++ when memory is used without having first been initialized to a known safe value. These types of bugs can be confusing, and even the term \u201cuninitialized\u201d is misleading. Uninitialized may seem to imply that a variable has a random value.  In reality it isn\u2019t random. It has whatever value was previously placed there. This value may be predictable or even attacker controlled. Unfortunately this behavior can result in a serious vulnerability such as information disclosure bugs like ASLR bypasses, or control flow hijacking via a stack or heap spray. Another possible side effect of using uninitialized values is advanced compiler optimizations may transform the code unpredictably, as this is considered undefined behavior by the relevant C standards.ASLRstack or heap sprayundefined behavior\nIn practice, uses of uninitialized memory are difficult to detect. Such errors may sit in the codebase unnoticed for years if the memory happens to be initialized with some \"safe\" value most of the time. When uninitialized memory results in a bug, it is often challenging to identify the source of the error, particularly if it is rarely triggered.Eliminating an entire class of such bugs is a lot more effective than hunting them down individually. Automatic stack variable initialization relies on a feature in the Clang compiler which allows choosing initializing local variables with either zeros or a pattern.Initializing to zero provides safer defaults for strings, pointers, indexes, and sizes. The downsides of zero init are less-safe defaults for return values, and exposing fewer bugs where the underlying code relies on zero initialization. Pattern initialization tends to expose more bugs and is generally safer for return values and less safe for strings, pointers, indexes, and sizes.\nAutomatic stack variable initialization is enabled throughout the entire Android userspace. During the development of Android 11, we initially selected pattern in order to uncover bugs relying on zero init and then moved to zero-init after a few months for increased safety. Platform OS developers can build with `AUTO_PATTERN_INITIALIZE=true m` if they want help uncovering bugs relying on zero init.\nAutomatic stack and heap initialization were recently merged in the upstream Linux kernel. We have made these features available on earlier versions of Android\u2019s kernel including 4.14, 4.19, and 5.4. These features enforce initialization of local variables and heap allocations with known values that cannot be controlled by attackers and are useless when leaked. Both features result in a performance overhead, but also prevent undefined behavior improving both stability and security.stackheap4.144.195.4\nFor kernel stack initialization we adopted the CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL from upstream Linux. It currently relies on Clang pattern initialization for stack variables, although this is subject to change in the future.\nHeap initialization is controlled by two boot-time flags, init_on_alloc and init_on_free, with the former wiping freshly allocated heap objects with zeroes (think s/kmalloc/kzalloc in the whole kernel) and the latter doing the same before the objects are freed (this helps to reduce the lifetime of security-sensitive data). init_on_alloc is a lot more cache-friendly and has smaller performance impact (within 2%), therefore it has been chosen to protect Android kernels.\nIn Android 11, Scudo replaces jemalloc as the default native allocator for Android. Scudo is a hardened memory allocator designed to help detect and mitigate memory corruption bugs in the heap, such as:Double freeArbitrary freeHeap-based buffer overflowUse-after-free\nScudo does not fully prevent exploitation but it does add a number of sanity checks which are effective at strengthening the heap against some memory corruption bugs.\nIt also proactively organizes the heap in a way that makes exploitation of memory corruption more difficult, by reducing the predictability of the allocation patterns, and separating allocations by sizes.\nIn our internal testing, Scudo has already proven its worth by surfacing security and stability bugs that were previously undetected.\nAndroid 11 introduces GWP-ASan, an in-production heap memory safety bug detection tool that's integrated directly into the native allocator Scudo. GWP-ASan probabilistically detects and provides actionable reports for heap memory safety bugs when they occur, works on 32-bit and 64-bit processes, and is enabled by default for system processes and system apps.\nGWP-ASan is also available for developer applications via a one line opt-in in an app's AndroidManifest.xml, with no complicated build support or recompilation of prebuilt libraries necessary.available for developer applications\nContinuing work on adopting the Arm Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) in Android, Android 11 includes support for kernel HWASAN, also known as Software Tag-Based KASAN. Userspace HWASAN is supported since Android 10.adopting the Arm Memory Tagging ExtensionHWASANSoftware Tag-Based KASANHWASAN\nKernelAddressSANitizer (KASAN) is a dynamic memory error detector designed to find out-of-bound and use-after-free bugs in the Linux kernel. Its Software Tag-Based mode is a software implementation of the memory tagging concept for the kernel. Software Tag-Based KASAN is available in 4.14, 4.19 and 5.4 Android kernels, and can be enabled with the CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS kernel configuration option. Currently Tag-Based KASAN only supports tagging of slab memory; support for other types of memory (such as stack and globals) will be added in the future.KernelAddressSANitizerSoftware Tag-Based mode\nCompared to Generic KASAN, Tag-Based KASAN has significantly lower memory requirements (see this kernel commit for details), which makes it usable on dog food testing devices. Another use case for Software Tag-Based KASAN is checking the existing kernel code for compatibility with memory tagging. As Tag-Based KASAN is based on similar concepts as the future in-kernel MTE support, making sure that kernel code works with Tag-Based KASAN will ease in-kernel MTE integration in the future.Generic KASANthis kernel commit\nWe\u2019ve continued to expand the compiler mitigations that have been rolled out in prior releases as well. This includes adding both integer and bounds sanitizers to some core libraries that were lacking them. For example, the libminikin fonts library and the libui rendering library are now bounds sanitized. We\u2019ve hardened the NFC stack by implementing both integer overflow sanitizer and bounds sanitizer in those components.priorreleases\nIn addition to the hard mitigations like sanitizers, we also continue to expand our use of CFI as an exploit mitigation.

      "date": "June 29, 2020",
      "abstract": "11 Weeks of Android: Privacy and Security\nThis blog post is part of a weekly series for #11WeeksOfAndroid. For each #11WeeksOfAndroid, we\u2019re diving into a key area so you don\u2019t miss anything. This week, we spotlighted Privacy and Security; here\u2019s a look at what you should know.#11WeeksOfAndroid#11WeeksOfAndroid\nPrivacy and security is core to how we design Android, and with every new release we increase our investment in this space. Android 11 continues to make important strides in these areas, and this week we\u2019ll be sharing a series of updates and resources about Android privacy and security. But first, let\u2019s take a quick look at some of the most important changes we\u2019ve made in Android 11 to protect user privacy and make the platform more secure.\nAs shared in the \u201cAll things privacy in Android 11\u201d video, we\u2019re giving users even more control over sensitive permissions. Throughout the development of this release, we have engaged deeply and frequently with our developer community to design these features in a balanced way - amplifying user privacy while minimizing developer impact. Let\u2019s go over some of these features:All things privacy in Android 11\nOne-time permission: In Android 10, we introduced a granular location permission that allows users to limit access to location only when an app is in use (aka foreground only). When presented with the new runtime permissions options, users choose foreground only location more than 50% of the time. This demonstrated to us that users really wanted finer controls for permissions. So in Android 11, we\u2019ve introduced one time permissions that let users give an app access to the device microphone, camera, or location, just that one time. As an app developer, there are no changes that you need to make to your app for it to work with one time permissions, and the app can request permissions again the next time the app is used. Learn more about building privacy-friendly apps with these new changes in this video.one time permissionsin this video\nBackground location: In Android 10 we added a background location usage reminder so users can see how apps are using this sensitive data on a regular basis. Users who interacted with the reminder either downgraded or denied the location permission over 75% of the time. In addition, we have done extensive research and believe that there are very few legitimate use cases for apps to require access to location in the background.\nIn Android 11, background location will no longer be a permission that a user can grant via a run time prompt and it will require a more deliberate action. If your app needs background location, the system will ensure that the app first asks for foreground location. The app can then broaden its access to background location through a separate permission request, which will cause the system to take the user to Settings in order to complete the permission grant.\nIn February, we announced that Google Play developers will need to get approval to access background location in their app to prevent misuse. We're giving developers more time to make changes and won't be enforcing the policy for existing apps until 2021. Check out this helpful video to find possible background location usage in your code.announcedto find possible background location usage in your code\nPermissions auto-reset: Most users tend to download and install over 60 apps on their device but interact with only a third of these apps on a regular basis. If users haven\u2019t used an app that targets Android 11 for an extended period of time, the system will \u201cauto-reset\u201d all of the granted runtime permissions associated with the app and notify the user. The app can request the permissions again the next time the app is used. If you have an app that has a legitimate need to retain permissions, you can prompt users to turn this feature OFF for your app in Settings.auto-reset\nData access auditing APIs: Android encourages developers to limit their access to sensitive data, even if they have been granted permission to do so. In Android 11, developers will have access to new APIs that will give them more transparency into their app\u2019s usage of private and protected data. The APIs will enable apps to track when the system records the app\u2019s access to private user data.new APIs\nScoped Storage: In Android 10, we introduced scoped storage which provides a filtered view into external storage, giving access to app-specific files and media collections. This change protects user privacy by limiting broad access to shared storage in many ways including changing the storage permission to only give read access to photos, videos and music and improving app storage attribution. Since Android 10, we\u2019ve incorporated developer feedback and made many improvements to help developers adopt scoped storage, including: updated permission UI to enhance user experience, direct file path access to media to improve compatibility with existing libraries, updated APIs for modifying media, Manage External Storage permission to enable select use cases that need broad files access, and protected external app directories. In Android 11, scoped storage will be mandatory for all apps that target API level 30. Learn more in this video and check out the developer documentation for further details.scoped storageManage External Storagevideodeveloper documentation\nGoogle Play system updates: Google Play system updates were introduced with Android 10 as part of Project Mainline. Their main benefit is to increase the modularity and granularity of platform subsystems within Android so we can update core OS components without needing a full OTA update from your phone manufacturer. Earlier this year, thanks to Project Mainline, we were able to quickly fix a critical vulnerability in the media decoding subsystem. Android 11 adds new modules, and maintains the security properties of existing ones. For example, Conscrypt, which provides cryptographic primitives, maintained its FIPS validation in Android 11 as well.Project Mainline\nBiometricPrompt API: Developers can now use the BiometricPrompt API to specify the biometric authenticator strength required by their app to unlock or access sensitive parts of the app. We are planning to add this to the Jetpack Biometric library to allow for backward compatibility and will share further updates on this work as it progresses.BiometricPrompt APIJetpack Biometric library\nIdentity Credential API: This will unlock new use cases such as mobile drivers licences, National ID, and Digital ID. It\u2019s being built by our security team to ensure this information is stored safely, using security hardware to secure and control access to the data, in a way that enhances user privacy as compared to traditional physical documents. We\u2019re working with various government agencies and industry partners to make sure that Android 11 is ready for such digital-first identity experiences.enhances user privacy\nThank you for your flexibility and feedback as we continue to build an increasingly more private and secure platform.

      "title": "Enhanced Safe Browsing Protection now available in Chrome",
      "date": "May 19, 2020",
      "abstract": "Enhanced Safe Browsing Protection now available in Chrome\nOver the past few years we\u2019ve seen threats on the web becoming increasingly sophisticated. Phishing sites rotate domains very quickly to avoid being blocked, and malware campaigns are directly targeting at-risk users. We\u2019ve realized that to combat these most effectively, security cannot be one-size-fits-all anymore: That\u2019s why today we are announcing Enhanced Safe Browsing protection in Chrome, a new option for users who require or want a more advanced level of security while browsing the web.\nTurning on Enhanced Safe Browsing will substantially increase protection from dangerous websites and downloads. By sharing real-time data with Google Safe Browsing, Chrome can proactively protect you against dangerous sites. If you\u2019re signed in, Chrome and other Google apps you use (Gmail, Drive, etc) will be able to provide improved protection based on a holistic view of threats you encounter on the web and attacks against your Google Account. In other words, we\u2019re bringing the intelligence of Google\u2019s cutting-edge security tools directly into your browser.\nOver the next year, we\u2019ll be adding even more protections to this mode, including tailored warnings for phishing sites and file downloads and cross-product alerts.\nBuilding upon Safe Browsing\nSafe Browsing\u2019s blocklist API is an existing security protocol that protects billions of devices worldwide. Every day, Safe Browsing discovers thousands of new unsafe sites and adds them to the blocklist API that is shared with the web industry. Chrome checks the URL of each site you visit or file you download against a local list, which is updated approximately every 30 minutes. Increasingly, some sophisticated phishing sites slip through that 30-minute refresh window by switching domains very quickly.\nThis protocol is designed so that Google cannot determine the actual URL Chrome visited from this information, and thus by necessity the same verdict is returned regardless of the user\u2019s situation. This means Chrome can\u2019t adjust protection based on what kinds of threats a particular user is seeing or the type of sites they normally visit. So while the Safe Browsing blocklist API remains very powerful and will continue to protect users, we\u2019ve been looking for ways to provide more proactive and tailored protections.\nHow Enhanced Safe Browsing works\nWhen you switch to Enhanced Safe Browsing, Chrome will share additional security data directly with Google Safe Browsing to enable more accurate threat assessments. For example, Chrome will check uncommon URLs in real time to detect whether the site you are about to visit may be a phishing site. Chrome will also send a small sample of pages and suspicious downloads to help discover new threats against you and other Chrome users.\nIf you are signed in to Chrome, this data is temporarily linked to your Google Account. We do this so that when an attack is detected against your browser or account, Safe Browsing can tailor its protections to your situation. In this way, we can provide the most precise protection without unnecessary warnings. After a short period, Safe Browsing anonymizes this data so it is no longer connected to your account.\nYou can opt in to this mode by visiting Privacy and Security settings > Security > and selecting the \u201cEnhanced protection\u201d mode under Safe Browsing. It will be rolled out gradually in M83 on desktop platforms, with Android support coming in a future release. Enterprise administrators can control this setting via the SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel policy.\nTailored protections\nChrome\u2019s billions of users are incredibly diverse, with a full spectrum of needs and perspectives in security and privacy. We will continue to invest in both Standard and Enhanced Safe Browsing with the goal to expand Chrome\u2019s security offerings to cover all users.\n                        Google",

      "date": "February 25, 2020",
      "abstract": "Data Encryption on Android with Jetpack SecurityPosted by Jon Markoff, Staff Developer Advocate, Android SecurityJon Markoff, Staff Developer Advocate, Android Security\nHave you ever tried to encrypt data in your app?  As a developer, you want to keep data safe, and in the hands of the party intended to use. But if you\u2019re like most Android developers, you don\u2019t have a dedicated security team to help encrypt your app\u2019s data properly. By searching the web to learn how to encrypt data, you might get answers that are several years out of date and provide incorrect examples.\nThe Jetpack Security (JetSec) crypto library provides abstractions for encrypting Files and SharedPreferences objects. The library promotes the use of the AndroidKeyStore while using safe and well-known cryptographic primitives. Using EncryptedFile and EncryptedSharedPreferences allows you to locally protect files that may contain sensitive data, API keys, OAuth tokens, and other types of secrets.Jetpack SecurityAndroidKeyStorecryptographic primitives\nWhy would you want to encrypt data in your app? Doesn\u2019t Android, since 5.0, encrypt the contents of the user's data partition by default? It certainly does, but there are some use cases where you may want an extra level of protection. If your app uses shared storage, you should encrypt the data. In the app home directory, your app should encrypt data if your app handles sensitive information including but not limited to personally identifiable information (PII), health records, financial details, or enterprise data. When possible, we recommend that you tie this information to biometrics for an extra level of protection.encrypt the contents of the user's data partitionshared storage\nJetpack Security is based on Tink, an open-source, cross-platform security project from Google. Tink might be appropriate if you need general encryption, hybrid encryption, or something similar. Jetpack Security data structures are fully compatible with Tink.Tink\nBefore we jump into encrypting your data, it\u2019s important to understand how your encryption keys will be kept safe. Jetpack Security uses a master key, which encrypts all subkeys that are used for each cryptographic operation. JetSec provides a recommended default master key in the MasterKeys class. This class uses a basic AES256-GCM key which is generated and stored in the AndroidKeyStore. The AndroidKeyStore is a container which stores cryptographic keys in the TEE or StrongBox, making them hard to extract. Subkeys are stored in a configurable  SharedPreferences object.\nPrimarily, we use the AES256_GCM_SPEC specification in Jetpack Security, which is recommended for general use cases. AES256-GCM is symmetric and generally fast on modern devices.\nFor apps that require more configuration, or handle very sensitive data, it\u2019s recommended to build your KeyGenParameterSpec, choosing options that make sense for your use. Time-bound keys with BiometricPrompt can provide an extra level of protection against rooted or compromised devices.BiometricPrompt\nImportant options:\nNote: If your app needs to encrypt data in the background, you should not use time-bound keys or require that the device is unlocked, as you will not be able to accomplish this without a user present.\nYou must use BiometricPrompt to authorize the device if your key was created with the following options:\nAfter the user authenticates, the keys are unlocked for the amount of time set in the validity seconds field. The AndroidKeystore does not have an API to query key settings, so your app  must keep track of these settings. You should build your BiometricPrompt instance in the onCreate() method of the activity where you present the dialog to the user.\nBiometricPrompt code to unlock time-bound keys\nJetpack Security includes an EncryptedFile class, which removes the challenges of encrypting file data. Similar to File, EncryptedFile provides a FileInputStream object for reading and a FileOutputStream object for writing. Files are encrypted using Streaming AEAD, which follows the OAE2 definition. The data is divided into chunks and encrypted using AES256-GCM in such a way that it's not possible to reorder.Streaming AEAD, which follows the OAE2 definition\nIf your application needs to save Key-value pairs - such as API keys - JetSec provides the EncryptedSharedPreferences class, which uses the same SharedPreferences interface that you\u2019re used to.\nBoth keys and values are encrypted. Keys are encrypted using AES256-SIV-CMAC, which provides a deterministic cipher text; values are encrypted with AES256-GCM and are bound to the encrypted key. This scheme allows the key data to be encrypted safely, while still allowing lookups.AES256-SIV-CMAC\nFileLocker is a sample app on the Android Security GitHub samples page. It\u2019s a great example of how to use File encryption using Jetpack Security.FileLocker\nHappy Encrypting!\n                        Google\nandroid security",

      "abstract": "An Update on Android TLS AdoptionPosted by Bram Bonn\u00e9, Senior Software Engineer, Android Platform Security & Chad Brubaker, Staff Software Engineer, Android Platform Security\nAndroid is committed to keeping users, their devices, and their data safe. One of the ways that we keep data safe is by protecting network traffic that enters or leaves an Android device with Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nAndroid 7 (API level 24) introduced the Network Security Configuration in 2016, allowing app developers to configure the network security policy for their app through a declarative configuration file. To ensure apps are safe, apps targeting Android 9 (API level 28) or higher automatically have a policy set by default that prevents unencrypted traffic for every domain.introducedNetwork Security Configurationpolicy\nToday, we\u2019re happy to announce that 80% of Android apps are encrypting traffic by default. The percentage is even greater for apps targeting Android 9 and higher, with 90% of them encrypting traffic by default.\nPercentage of apps that block cleartext by default.\nSince November 1 2019, all app (updates as well as all new apps on Google Play) must target at least Android 9. As a result, we expect these numbers to continue improving. Network traffic from these apps is secure by default and any use of unencrypted connections is the result of an explicit choice by the developer.all app (updates as well as all new apps on Google Play) must target at least Android 9\nThe latest releases of Android Studio and Google Play\u2019s pre-launch report warn developers when their app includes a potentially insecure Network Security Configuration (for example, when they allow unencrypted traffic for all domains or when they accept user provided certificates outside of debug mode). This encourages the adoption of HTTPS across the Android ecosystem and ensures that developers are aware of their security configuration.pre-launch report\nExample of a warning shown to developers in Android Studio.\nExample of a warning shown to developers as part of the pre-launch report.pre-launch report\nFor apps targeting Android 9 and higher, the out-of-the-box default is to encrypt all network traffic in transit and trust only certificates issued by an authority in the standard Android CA set without requiring any extra configuration.

      "abstract": "Expanding the Android Security Rewards Program\nThe Android Security Rewards (ASR) program was created in 2015 to reward researchers who find and report security issues to help keep the Android ecosystem safe. Over the past 4 years, we have awarded over 1,800 reports, and paid out over four million dollars.Android Security Rewards\nToday, we\u2019re expanding the program and increasing reward amounts. We are introducing a top prize of $1 million for a full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence which compromises the Titan M secure element on Pixel devices. Additionally, we will be launching a specific program offering a 50% bonus for exploits found on specific developer preview versions of Android, meaning our top prize is now $1.5 million.\nAs mentioned in a previous blog post, in 2019 Gartner rated the Pixel 3 with Titan M as having the most \u201cstrong\u201d ratings in the built-in security section out of all devices evaluated. This is why we\u2019ve created a dedicated prize to reward researchers for exploits found to circumvent the secure elements protections.previous blog post,\nIn addition to exploits involving Pixel Titan M, we have added other categories of exploits to the rewards program, such as those involving data exfiltration and lockscreen bypass. These rewards go up to $500,000 depending on the exploit category. For full details, please refer to the Android Security Rewards Program Rules page.Android Security Rewards Program Rules page\nNow that we\u2019ve covered some of what\u2019s new, let\u2019s take a look back at some milestones from this year. Here are some highlights from 2019:\nThe highest reward paid out to a member of the research community was for a report from Guang Gong (@oldfresher) of Alpha Lab, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. This report detailed the first reported 1-click remote code execution exploit chain on the Pixel 3 device. Guang Gong was awarded $161,337 from the Android Security Rewards program and $40,000 by Chrome Rewards program for a total of $201,337. The $201,337 combined reward is also the highest reward for a single exploit chain across all Google VRP programs. The Chrome vulnerabilities leveraged in this report were fixed in Chrome 77.0.3865.75 and released in September, protecting users against this exploit chain.@oldfresherAndroid Security Rewards programChrome Rewards programChrome 77.0.3865.75\nWe\u2019d like to thank all of our researchers for contributing to the security of the Android ecosystem.

      "abstract": "GWP-ASan: Sampling heap memory error detection in-the-wild\nMemory safety errors, like use-after-frees and out-of-bounds reads/writes, are a leading source of vulnerabilities in C/C++ applications. Despite investments in preventing and detecting these errors in Chrome, over 60% of high severity vulnerabilities in Chrome are memory safety errors. Some memory safety errors don\u2019t lead to security vulnerabilities but simply cause crashes and instability.\nChrome uses state-of-the-art techniques to prevent these errors, including:Coverage-guidedfuzzingAddressSanitizer\nChrome also makes use of sandboxing and exploit mitigations to complicate exploitation of memory errors that go undetected by the methods above.\nAddressSanitizer is a compiler instrumentation that finds memory errors occurring on the heap, stack, or in globals. ASan is highly effective and one of the lowest overhead instrumentations available that detects the errors that it does; however, it still incurs an average 2-3x performance and memory overhead. This makes it suitable for use with unit tests or fuzzing, but not deployment to end users. Chrome used to deploy SyzyASAN instrumented binaries to detect memory errors. SyzyASAN had a similar overhead so it was only deployed to a small subset of users on the canary channel. It was discontinued after the Windows toolchain switched to LLVM.SyzyASAN instrumented binaries\nGWP-ASan, also known by its recursive backronym, GWP-ASan Will Provide Allocation Sanity, is a sampling allocation tool designed to detect heap memory errors occurring in production with negligible overhead. Because of its negligible overhead we can deploy GWP-ASan to the entire Chrome user base to find memory errors happening in the real world that are not caught by fuzzing or testing with ASan. Unlike ASan, GWP-ASan can not find memory errors on the stack or in globals.\nGWP-ASan is currently enabled for all Windows and macOS users for allocations made using malloc() and PartitionAlloc. It is only enabled for a small fraction of allocations and processes to reduce performance and memory overhead to a negligible amount. At the time of writing it has found over sixty bugs (many are still restricted view). About 90% of the issues GWP-ASan has found are use-after-frees. The remaining are out-of-bounds reads and writes.over sixty bugs\nTo learn more, check out our full write up on GWP-ASan here.here\n                        Google",

      "abstract": "Improving Site Isolation for Stronger Browser Security\nThe Chrome Security team values having multiple lines of defense. Web browsers are complex, and malicious web pages may try to find and exploit browser bugs to steal data. Additional lines of defense, like sandboxes, make it harder for attackers to access your computer, even if bugs in the browser are exploited. With Site Isolation, Chrome has gained a new line of defense that helps protect your accounts on the Web as well.sandboxesSite Isolation\nSite Isolation ensures that pages from different sites end up in different sandboxed processes in the browser. Chrome can thus limit the entire process to accessing data from only one site, making it harder for an attacker to steal cross-site data. We started isolating all sites for desktop users back in Chrome 67, and now we\u2019re excited to enable it on Android for sites that users log into in Chrome 77. We've also strengthened Site Isolation on desktop to help defend against even fully compromised processes.for desktop users back in Chrome 67in Chrome 77\nSite Isolation helps defend against two types of threats. First, attackers may try to use advanced \"side channel\" attacks to leak sensitive data from a process through unexpected means. For example, Spectre attacks take advantage of CPU performance features to access data that should be off limits. With Site Isolation, it is harder for the attacker to get cross-site data into their process in the first place.Spectre\nSecond, even more powerful attackers may discover security bugs in the browser, allowing them to completely hijack the sandboxed process. On desktop platforms, Site Isolation can now catch these misbehaving processes and limit their access to cross-site data. We're working to bring this level of hijacked process protection to Android in the future as well.\nThanks to this extra line of defense, Chrome can now help keep your web accounts even more secure. We are still making improvements to get the full benefits of Site Isolation, but this change gives Chrome a solid foundation for protecting your data.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more, check out our technical write up on the Chromium blog.technical write up\n                        Google",

At Google, we understand the strength of open platforms and ecosystems, and that the best ideas don\u2019t always come from within. It is for this reason that we offer a broad range of vulnerability reward programs, encouraging the community to help us improve security for everyone. Today, we\u2019re expanding on those efforts with some big changes to Google Play Security Reward Program (GPSRP), as well as the launch of the new Developer Data Protection Reward Program (DDPRP). Google Play Security Reward Program (GPSRP) Developer Data Protection Reward Program (DDPRP)\nWe are increasing the scope of GPSRP to include all apps in Google Play with 100 million or more installs. These apps are now eligible for rewards, even if the app developers don\u2019t have their own vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program. In these scenarios, Google helps responsibly disclose identified vulnerabilities to the affected app developer. This opens the door for security researchers to help hundreds of organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities in their apps. If the developers already have their own programs, researchers can collect rewards directly from them on top of the rewards from Google. We encourage app developers to start their own vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program to work directly with the security researcher community.\nVulnerability data from GPSRP helps Google create automated checks that scan all apps available in Google Play for similar vulnerabilities. Affected app developers are notified through the Play Console as part of the App Security Improvement (ASI) program, which provides information on the vulnerability and how to fix it. Over its lifetime, ASI has helped more than 300,000 developers fix more than 1,000,000 apps on Google Play. In 2018 alone, the program helped over 30,000 developers fix over 75,000 apps. The downstream effect means that those 75,000 vulnerable apps are not distributed to users until the issue is fixed. App Security Improvement (ASI)\nTo date, GPSRP has paid out over $265,000 in bounties. Recent scope and reward increases have resulted in $75,500 in rewards across July & August alone. With these changes, we anticipate even further engagement from the security research community to bolster the success of the program. reward increases\nToday, we are also launching the Developer Data Protection Reward Program. DDPRP is a bounty program, in collaboration with HackerOne, meant to identify and mitigate data abuse issues in Android apps, OAuth projects, and Chrome extensions. It recognizes the contributions of individuals who help report apps that are violating Google Play, Google API, or Google Chrome Web Store Extensions program policies. Developer Data Protection Reward Program recognizes\nThe program aims to reward anyone who can provide verifiably and unambiguous evidence of data abuse, in a similar model as Google\u2019s other vulnerability reward programs. In particular, the program aims to identify situations where user data is being used or sold unexpectedly, or repurposed in an illegitimate way without user consent. If data abuse is identified related to an app or Chrome extension, that app or extension will accordingly be removed from Google Play or Google Chrome Web Store. In the case of an app developer abusing access to Gmail restricted scopes, their API access will be removed. While no reward table or maximum reward is listed at this time, depending on impact, a single report could net as large as a $50,000 bounty.\nAs 2019 continues, we look forward to seeing what researchers find next.

      "abstract": "Adopting the Arm Memory Tagging Extension in Android\nAs part of our continuous commitment to improve the security of the Android ecosystem, we are partnering with Arm to design the memory tagging extension (MTE). Memory safety bugs, common in C and C++, remain one of the largest vulnerabilities in the Android platform and although there have been previous hardening efforts, memory safety bugs comprised more than half of the high priority security bugs in Android 9. Additionally, memory safety bugs manifest as hard to diagnose reliability problems, including sporadic crashes or silent data corruption. This reduces user satisfaction and increases the cost of software development. Software testing tools, such as ASAN and HWASAN help, but their applicability on current hardware is limited due to noticeable overheads.memory tagging extensionMemory safety bugshardening effortsincreases the cost of software developmentASANHWASAN\nMTE, a hardware feature, aims to further mitigate these memory safety bugs by enabling us to detect them with low overhead. It has two execution modes:\nArm recently published a whitepaper on MTE and has added documentation to the Arm v8.5 Architecture Reference Manual.whitepaper on MTEArchitecture Reference Manual\nWe envision several different usage modes for MTE.ASANHWASANGoogle Play Console\nWe believe that memory tagging will detect the most common classes of memory safety bugs in the wild, helping vendors identify and fix them, discouraging malicious actors from exploiting them. During the past year, our team has been working to ensure readiness of the Android platform and application software for MTE. We have deployed HWASAN, a software implementation of the memory tagging concept, to test our entire platform and a few select apps. This deployment has uncovered close to 100 memory safety bugs. The majority of these bugs were detected on HWASAN enabled phones in everyday use. MTE will greatly improve upon this in terms of overhead, ease of deployment, and scale. In parallel, we have been working on supporting MTE in the LLVM compiler toolchain and in the Linux kernel. The Android platform support for MTE will be complete by the time of silicon availability.in the LLVM compiler toolchainin the Linux kernel\nGoogle is committed to supporting MTE throughout the Android software stack. We are working with select Arm System On Chip (SoC) partners to test MTE support and look forward to wider deployment of MTE in the Android software and hardware ecosystem. Based on the current data points, MTE provides tremendous benefits at acceptable performance costs.

      "abstract": "Chrome Fuzzer Program Update And How-To\nTL;DR We increased the Chrome Fuzzer Program bonus from $500 to $1,000 as part of our recent update of reward amounts.update of reward amounts\nChrome Fuzzer Program is a part of the Google Chrome Vulnerability Reward Program that lets security researchers run their fuzzers at scale on the ClusterFuzz infrastructure. It makes bug reporting fully automated, and the fuzzer authors get the same rewards as if they reported the bugs manually, plus an extra bonus ($1,000 as of now) on top of it for every new vulnerability.Chrome Fuzzer ProgramClusterFuzz\nWe run fuzzers indefinitely, and some of the fuzzers contributed years ago are still finding security issues in ever changing Chrome code. This is a win-win for both sides, as security researchers do not have to spend time analyzing the crashes, and Chrome developers receive high quality bug reports automatically.\nTo learn more about the Chrome Fuzzer Program, let\u2019s talk to Ned Williamson, who\u2019s been a participant since 2017 and now works on the Google Security team.\nQ: Hey Ned! It looks like you\u2019ve received over $50,000 by participating in the Google Chrome Vulnerability Reward Program with your quic_stream_factory_fuzzer.quic_stream_factory_fuzzer\nA: Yes, it\u2019s true. I wrote a fuzzer for QUIC which helped me find and report two critical vulnerabilities, each worth $10,000. Because I knew my fuzzer worked well, I submitted it to the Chrome Fuzzer Program. Then, in the next few months, I received that reward three more times (plus a bonus), as the fuzzer caught several security regressions on ClusterFuzz soon after they happened.\nQ: Have you intentionally focused on the areas that yield higher severity issues and bigger rewards?higher severity\nA: Yes. While vulnerabilities in code that is more critical to user security yield larger reward amounts, I actually started by looking at lower severity bugs and incrementally began looking for more severe bugs until I could find critical ones. You can see this progression by looking at the bugs I reported manually as an external researcher.bugs I reported manually\nQ: Would you suggest starting by looking for non-critical bugs?\nA: I would say so. Security-critical code is generally better designed and more thoroughly audited, so it might be discouraging to start from there. Finding less critical security bugs and winning bounties is a good way to build confidence and stay motivated.\nQ: Can you share an algorithm on how to find security bugs in Chrome?\nA: Looking at previous and existing bug reports, even for non-security crashes, is a great way to tell which code is security-critical and potentially buggy. From there, if some code looks like it\u2019s exposed to user inputs, I\u2019d set up a fuzzing campaign against that component. After you gain experience you will not need to rely on existing reports to find new attack surface, which in turn helps you find places that have not been considered by previous researchers. This was the case for my QUIC fuzzer.\nQ: How did you learn to write fuzzers?\nA: I didn\u2019t have any special knowledge about fuzzing before I started looking for vulnerabilities in Chrome. I followed the documentation in the repository and I still follow the same process today.documentation\nQ: Your fuzzer isn\u2019t very simple compared to many other fuzzers. How did you get to that implementation?Your fuzzermany other fuzzers\nA: The key insight in the QUIC fuzzer was realizing that the parts of the code that handled plaintext messages after decryption were prone to memory corruption. Typically, fuzzing does not perform well with encrypted inputs (it\u2019s pretty hard to \u201crandomly\u201d generate a packet that can be successfully decrypted), so I extended the QUIC testing code to allow for testing with encryption disabled.\nQ: Are there any other good examples of fuzz targets employing a similar logic?\nA: Another example is pdf_formcalc_context_fuzzer that wraps the fuzzing input around with a valid hardcoded PDF file, therefore focusing fuzzing only on the XFA script part of it. As a researcher, you just need to choose what exactly you want to fuzz, and then understand how to execute that code properly. Looking at the unit tests is usually the easiest way to get such an understanding.pdf_formcalc_context_fuzzer\nUseful links:Fuzzing documentationExisting fuzz targetsFuzzing coverage dashboardMedium+ severity bugs reported via Chrome VRP\nHappy fuzzing and bug hunting!\n                        Google",

We're proud that community includes world class security researchers who help defend Chrome, and other Chromium based browsers.Chromium\nBack in 2010 we created the Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program which provides cash rewards to researchers for finding and reporting security bugs that help keep our users safe. Since its inception the program has received over 8,500 reports and paid out over five million dollars! A big thank you to every one of the researchers - it's an honor working with you.we created\nOver the years we've expanded the program, including rewarding full chain exploits on Chrome OS, and the Chrome Fuzzer Program, where we run researchers' fuzzers on thousands of Google cores and automatically submit bugs they find for reward.Chrome Fuzzer Program\nToday, we're delighted to announce an across the board increase in our reward amounts! Full details can be found on our program rules page but highlights include tripling the maximum baseline reward amount from $5,000 to $15,000 and doubling the maximum reward amount for high quality reports from $15,000 to $30,000. The additional bonus given to bugs found by fuzzers running under Chrome Fuzzer Program is also doubling to $1,000.program rules page\nWe've also clarified what we consider a high quality report, to help reporters get the highest possible reward, and we've updated the bug categories to better reflect the types of bugs that are reported and that we are most interested in.high quality report\nBut that's not all! On Chrome OS we're increasing our standing reward to $150,000 for exploit chains that can compromise a Chromebook or Chromebox with persistence in guest mode. Security bug in firmware and lock screen bypasses also get their own reward categories.\nThese new reward amounts will apply to bugs submitted after today on the Chromium bug tracker using the Security template.

      "date": "May 9, 2019",
      "abstract": "What\u2019s New in Android Q Security\nPosted by Rene Mayrhofer and Xiaowen Xin, Android Security & Privacy TeamAndroid Developers Blog\nWith every new version of Android, one of our top priorities is raising the bar for security. Over the last few years, these improvements have led to measurable progress across the ecosystem, and 2018 was no different.\nIn the 4th quarter of 2018, we had 84% more devices receiving a security update than in the same quarter the prior year. At the same time, no critical security vulnerabilities affecting the Android platform were publicly disclosed without a security update or mitigation available in 2018, and we saw a 20% year-over-year decline in the proportion of devices that installed a Potentially Harmful App. In the spirit of transparency, we released this data and more in our Android Security & Privacy 2018 Year In Review.Potentially Harmful AppAndroid Security & Privacy 2018 Year In Review.\nBut now you may be asking, what\u2019s next?\nToday at Google I/O we lifted the curtain on all the new security features being integrated into Android Q. We plan to go deeper on each feature in the coming weeks and months, but first wanted to share a quick summary of all the security goodness we\u2019re adding to the platform.\nStorage encryption is one of the most fundamental (and effective) security technologies, but current encryption standards require devices have cryptographic acceleration hardware. Because of this requirement many devices are not capable of using storage encryption. The launch of Adiantum changes that in the Android Q release. We announced Adiantum in February. Adiantum is designed to run efficiently without specialized hardware, and can work across everything from smart watches to internet-connected medical devices.Adiantum\nOur commitment to the importance of encryption continues with the Android Q release. All compatible Android devices newly launching with Android Q are required to encrypt user data, with no exceptions. This includes phones, tablets, televisions, and automotive devices. This will ensure the next generation of devices are more secure than their predecessors, and allow the next billion people coming online for the first time to do so safely.\nHowever, storage encryption is just one half of the picture, which is why we are also enabling TLS 1.3 support by default in Android Q. TLS 1.3 is a major revision to the TLS standard finalized by the IETF in August 2018. It is faster, more secure, and more private.  TLS 1.3 can often complete the handshake in fewer roundtrips, making the connection time up to 40% faster for those sessions. From a security perspective, TLS 1.3 removes support for weaker cryptographic algorithms, as well as some insecure or obsolete features. It uses a newly-designed handshake which fixes several weaknesses in TLS 1.2. The new protocol is cleaner, less error prone, and more resilient to key compromise. Finally, from a privacy perspective, TLS 1.3 encrypts more of the handshake to better protect the identities of the participating parties.\nAndroid utilizes a strategy of defense-in-depth to ensure that individual implementation bugs are insufficient for bypassing our security systems. We apply process isolation, attack surface reduction, architectural decomposition, and exploit mitigations to render vulnerabilities more difficult or impossible to exploit, and to increase the number of vulnerabilities needed by an attacker to achieve their goals.\nIn Android Q, we have applied these strategies to security critical areas such as media, Bluetooth, and the kernel. We describe these improvements more extensively in a separate blog post, but some highlights include:blog post\nAndroid Pie introduced the BiometricPrompt API to help apps utilize biometrics, including face, fingerprint, and iris. Since the launch, we\u2019ve seen a lot of apps embrace the new API, and now with Android Q, we\u2019ve updated the underlying framework with robust support for face and fingerprint. Additionally, we expanded the API to support additional use-cases, including both implicit and explicit authentication.\nIn the explicit flow, the user must perform an action to proceed, such as tap their finger to the fingerprint sensor.  If they\u2019re using face or iris to authenticate, then the user must click an additional button to proceed. The explicit flow is the default flow and should be used for all high-value transactions such as payments.\nImplicit flow does not require an additional user action. It is used to provide a lighter-weight, more seamless experience for transactions that are readily and easily reversible, such as sign-in and autofill.\nAnother handy new feature in BiometricPrompt is the ability to check if a device supports biometric authentication prior to invoking BiometricPrompt. This is useful when the app wants to show an \u201cenable biometric sign-in\u201d or similar item in their sign-in page or in-app settings menu.  To support this, we\u2019ve added a new BiometricManager class. You can now call the canAuthenticate() method in it to determine whether the device supports biometric authentication and whether the user is enrolled.BiometricManagercanAuthenticate()\nBeyond Android Q, we are looking to add Electronic ID support for mobile apps, so that your phone can be used as an ID, such as a driver\u2019s license. Apps such as these have a lot of security requirements and involves integration between the client application on the holder\u2019s mobile phone, a reader/verifier device, and issuing authority backend systems used for license issuance, updates, and revocation.\nThis initiative requires expertise around cryptography and standardization from the ISO and is being led by the Android Security and Privacy team. We will be providing APIs and a reference implementation of HALs for Android devices in order to ensure the platform provides the building blocks for similar security and privacy sensitive applications. You can expect to hear more updates from us on Electronic ID support in the near future.ISO\n                        Google\nandroid security",

      "title": "Queue the Hardening Enhancements",
      "date": "May 9, 2019",
      "abstract": "Queue the Hardening Enhancements\nPosted by Jeff Vander Stoep, Android Security & Privacy Team and Chong Zhang, Android Media TeamAndroid Developers Blog\nAndroid Q Beta versions are now publicly available. Among the various new features introduced in Android Q are some important security hardening changes. While exciting new security features are added in each Android release, hardening generally refers to security improvements made to existing components.available new security features\nWhen prioritizing platform hardening, we analyze data from a number of sources including our vulnerability rewards program (VRP). Past security issues provide useful insight into which components can use additional hardening. Android publishes monthly security bulletins which include fixes for all the high/critical severity vulnerabilities in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) reported through our VRP. While fixing vulnerabilities is necessary, we also get a lot of value from the metadata - analysis on the location and class of vulnerabilities. With this insight we can apply the following strategies to our existing components:vulnerability rewards programmonthly security bulletins\nHere\u2019s a look at high severity vulnerabilities by component and cause from 2018:\nMost of Android\u2019s vulnerabilities occur in the media and bluetooth components. Use-after-free (UAF), integer overflows, and out of bounds (OOB) reads/writes comprise 90% of vulnerabilities with OOB being the most common.\nIn Android Q, we moved software codecs out of the main mediacodec service into a constrained sandbox. This is a big step forward in our effort to improve security by isolating various media components into less privileged sandboxes. As Mark Brand of Project Zero points out in his Return To Libstagefright blog post, constrained sandboxes are not where an attacker wants to end up. In 2018, approximately 80% of the critical/high severity vulnerabilities in media components occurred in software codecs, meaning further isolating them is a big improvement. Due to the increased protection provided by the new mediaswcodec sandbox, these same vulnerabilities will receive a lower severity based on Android\u2019s severity guidelines.constrained sandboxReturn To Libstagefrightseverity guidelines\nThe following figure shows an overview of the evolution of media services layout in the recent Android releases.security re-architecttreblized\nWith this move, we now have the two primary sources for media vulnerabilities tightly sandboxed within constrained processes. Software codecs are similar to extractors in that they both have extensive code parsing bitstreams from untrusted sources. Once a vulnerability is identified in the source code, it can be triggered by sending a crafted media file to media APIs (such as MediaExtractor or MediaCodec). Sandboxing these two services allows us to reduce the severity of potential security vulnerabilities without compromising performance.\nIn addition to constraining riskier codecs, a lot of work has also gone into preventing common types of vulnerabilities.\nIncorrect or missing memory bounds checking on arrays account for about 34% of Android\u2019s userspace vulnerabilities. In cases where the array size is known at compile time, LLVM\u2019s bound sanitizer (BoundSan) can automatically instrument arrays to prevent overflows and fail safely.BoundSan instrumentation\nBoundSan is enabled in 11 media codecs and throughout the Bluetooth stack for Android Q. By optimizing away a number of unnecessary checks the performance overhead was reduced to less than 1%. BoundSan has already found/prevented potential vulnerabilities in codecs and Bluetooth.unnecessarychecks\nAndroid pioneered the production use of sanitizers in Android Nougat when we first started rolling out integer sanization (IntSan) in the media frameworks. This work has continued with each release and has been very successful in preventing otherwise exploitable vulnerabilities. For example, new IntSan coverage in Android Pie mitigated 11 critical vulnerabilities. Enabling IntSan is challenging because overflows are generally benign and unsigned integer overflows are well defined and sometimes intentional. This is quite different from the bound sanitizer where OOB reads/writes are always unintended and often exploitable. Enabling Intsan has been a multi year project, but with Q we have fully enabled it across the media frameworks with the inclusion of 11 more codecs.pioneeredIntSan Instrumentation\nIntSan works by instrumenting arithmetic operations to abort when an overflow occurs. This instrumentation can have an impact on performance, so evaluating the impact on CPU usage is necessary. In cases where performance impact was too high, we identified hot functions and individually disabled IntSan on those functions after manually reviewing them for integer safety.\nBoundSan and IntSan are considered strong mitigations because (where applied) they prevent the root cause of memory safety vulnerabilities. The class of mitigations described next target common exploitation techniques. These mitigations are considered to be probabilistic because they make exploitation more difficult by limiting how a vulnerability may be used.\nLLVM\u2019s Control Flow Integrity (CFI) was enabled in the media frameworks, Bluetooth, and NFC in Android Pie. CFI makes code reuse attacks more difficult by protecting the forward-edges of the call graph, such as function pointers and virtual functions. Android Q uses LLVM\u2019s Shadow Call Stack (SCS) to protect return addresses, protecting the backwards-edge of control flow graph. SCS accomplishes this by storing return addresses in a separate shadow stack which is protected from leakage by storing its location in the x18 register, which is now reserved by the compiler.Android PieSCS Instrumentation\nSCS has negligible performance overhead and a small memory increase due to the separate stack. In Android Q, SCS has been turned on in portions of the Bluetooth stack and is also available for the kernel. We\u2019ll share more on that in an upcoming post.\nLike SCS, eXecute-Only Memory (XOM) aims at making common exploitation techniques more expensive. It does so by strengthening the protections already provided by address space layout randomization (ASLR) which in turn makes code reuse attacks more difficult by requiring attackers to first leak the location of the code they intend to reuse. This often means that an attacker now needs two vulnerabilities, a read primitive and a write primitive, where previously just a write primitive was necessary in order to achieve their goals. XOM protects against leaks (memory disclosures of code segments) by making code unreadable. Attempts to read execute-only code results in the process aborting safely.Tombstone from a XOM abort\nStarting in Android Q, platform-provided AArch64 code segments in binaries and libraries are loaded as execute-only. Not all devices will immediately receive the benefit as this enforcement has hardware dependencies (ARMv8.2+) and kernel dependencies (Linux 4.9+, CONFIG_ARM64_UAO). For apps with a targetSdkVersion lower than Q, Android\u2019s zygote process will relax the protection in order to avoid potential app breakage, but 64 bit system processes (for example, mediaextractor, init, vold, etc.) are protected. XOM protections are applied at compile-time and have no memory or CPU overhead.\nScudo is a dynamic heap allocator designed to be resilient against heap related vulnerabilities such as:\nScudo does not prevent exploitation but rather proactively manages memory in a way to make exploitation more difficult. It is configurable on a per-process basis depending on performance requirements. Scudo is enabled in extractors and codecs in the media frameworks.Tombstone from Scudo aborts\nAOSP makes use of a number of Open Source Projects to build and secure Android.

      "abstract": "Android Security Improvement update: Helping developers harden their apps, one thwarted vulnerability at a timePosted by Patrick Mutchler and Meghan Kelly, Android Security & Privacy TeamMeghan KellyAndroid Developers Blog\nHelping Android app developers build secure apps, free of known vulnerabilities, means helping the overall ecosystem thrive. This is why we launched the Application Security Improvement Program five years ago, and why we're still so invested in its success today.Application Security Improvement Program\nWhen an app is submitted to the Google Play store, we scan it to determine if a variety of vulnerabilities are present. If we find something concerning, we flag it to the developer and then help them to remedy the situation.\nThink of it like a routine physical. If there are no problems, the app runs through our normal tests and continues on the process to being published in the Play Store. If there is a problem, however, we provide a diagnosis and next steps to get back to healthy form.\nOver its lifetime, the program has helped more than 300,000 developers to fix more than 1,000,000 apps on Google Play. In 2018 alone, the program helped over 30,000 developers fix over 75,000 apps. The downstream effect means that those 75,000 vulnerable apps are not distributed to users with the same security issues present, which we consider a win.\nThe App Security Improvement program covers a broad range of security issues in Android apps. These can be as specific as security issues in certain versions of popular libraries (ex: CVE-2015-5256) and as broad as unsafe TLS/SSL certificate validation.ex: CVE-2015-5256unsafe TLS/SSL certificate validation\nWe are continuously improving this program's capabilities by improving the existing checks and launching checks for more classes of security vulnerability. In 2018, we deployed warnings for six additional security vulnerability classes including:\nEnsuring that we're continuing to evolve the program as new exploits emerge is a top priority for us. We are continuing to work on this throughout 2019.\nKeeping Android users safe is important to Google. We know that app security is often tricky and that developers can make mistakes. We hope to see this program grow in the years to come, helping developers worldwide build apps users can truly trust.\n                        Google\nandroid security",

      "date": "October 9, 2013",
      "abstract": "Going beyond vulnerability rewardsWe all benefit from the amazing volunteer work done by the open source community. That\u2019s why we keep asking ourselves how to take the model pioneered with our Vulnerability Reward Program - and employ it to improve the security of key third-party software critical to the health of the entire Internet.Vulnerability Reward ProgramWe thought about simply kicking off an OSS bug-hunting program, but this approach can easily backfire. In addition to valid reports, bug bounties invite a significant volume of spurious traffic - enough to completely overwhelm a small community of volunteers. On top of this, fixing a problem often requires more effort than finding it.So we decided to try something new: provide financial incentives for down-to-earth, proactive improvements that go beyond merely fixing a known security bug. Whether you want to switch to a more secure allocator, to add privilege separation, to clean up a bunch of sketchy calls to strcat(), or even just to enable ASLR - we want to help!We intend to roll out the program gradually, based on the quality of the received submissions and the feedback from the developer community. For the initial run, we decided to limit the scope to the following projects:Before participating, please read the official rules posted on this page; the document provides additional information about eligibility, rewards, and other important stuff.this pagePlease submit your patches directly to the maintainers of the individual projects. Once your patch is accepted and merged into the repository, please follow the submission process outlined here. If we think that the submission has a demonstrable, positive impact on the security of the project, you will qualify for a reward ranging from $500 to $3,133.7.hereHappy patching!\n                        Google",

      "date": "March 31, 2009",
      "abstract": "Reducing XSS by way of Automatic Context-Aware Escaping in Template SystemsBuilding on our earlier posts on defenses against web application flaws [\"Automating Web Application Security Testing\", \"Meet ratproxy, our passive web security assessment tool\"], we introduce Automatic Context-Aware Escaping (Auto-Escape for short), a functionality we added to two Google-developed general purpose template systems to better protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\"Automating Web Application Security Testing\"\"Meet ratproxy, our passive web security assessment tool\"We developed Auto-Escape specifically for general purpose template systems; that is, template systems that are for the most part unaware of the structure and programming language of the content on which they operate. These template systems typically provide minimal support for web applications, possibly limited to basic escaping functions that a developer can invoke to help escape unsafe content being returned in web responses. Our observation has been that web applications of substantial size and complexity using these template systems have an increased risk of introducing XSS flaws. To see why this is the case, consider the simplified template below in which double curly brackets {{ and }} enclose placeholders (variables) that are replaced with run-time content, presumed unsafe.In this template, four variables are used (not in this order):Browser Security HandbookEach of these variable insertions requires a different escaping method or risks introducing XSS. To keep the example small, we excluded several contexts of interest, particularly style tags, HTML attributes that expect Javascript (such as onmouseover), and considerations of whether attribute values are enclosed within quotes or not (which also affects escaping).The example above demonstrates the importance of understanding the precise context in which variables are being inserted and the need for escaping functions that are both safe and correct for each. For larger and complex web applications, we notice two related vectors for XSS:Considering the sheer number of templates in large web applications and the number of untrusted content they may operate on, the process of proper escaping becomes complicated and error prone. It is also difficult to efficiently audit from a security testing perspective. We developed Auto-Escape to take that complexity away from the developer and into the template system and therefore reduce the risks of XSS that would have ensued.Auto-Escape is a functionality designed to make the Template System web application context-aware and therefore able to apply automatically and properly the escaping required. This is achieved in three parts:A simple mechanism is provided for the developer to indicate that some variables are safe and should not be escaped. This is used for variables that are either escaped through other means in source code or contain trusted markup that should be emitted intact.Auto-Escape has been released with the C++ Google Ctemplate for a while now and it continues to develop there. You can read more about it in the Guide to using Auto-Escape. We also implemented Auto-Escape for the ClearSilver template system and expect it to be released in the near future. Lastly, we are in the process of integrating it into other template systems developed at Google for Java and Python and are interested in working with a few other open source template systems that may benefit from this logic. Our HTML/Javascript parser is already available with the Google Ctemplate distribution and is expected to be released as a stand-alone open source project very soon.Google CtemplateGuide to using Auto-EscapeClearSilver\n                        Google",

      "abstract": "Thwarting a large-scale phishing attackIn addition to targeting malware, we're interested in combating phishing, a social engineering attack where criminals attempt to lure unsuspecting web surfers into logging into a fake website that looks like a real website, such as eBay, E-gold or an online bank. Following a successful attack, phishers can steal money out of the victims' accounts or take their identities. To protect our users against phishing, we publish a blacklist of known phishing sites. This blacklist is the basis for the anti-phishing features in the latest versions of Firefox and Google Desktop. Although blacklists are necessarily a step behind as phishers move their phishing pages around, blacklists have proved to be reasonably effective.phishing,Not all phishing attacks target sites with obvious financial value. Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information.

We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised.

It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue.

We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue.

To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page.

Although blacklists are necessarily a step behind as phishers move their phishing pages around, blacklists have proved to be reasonably effective.phishing,Not all phishing attacks target sites with obvious financial value. Beginning in mid-March, we detected a five-fold increase in overall phishing page views. It turned out that the phishing pages generating 95% of the new phishing traffic targeted MySpace, the popular social networking site. While a MySpace account does not have any intrinsic monetary value, phishers had come up with ways to monetize this attack. We observed hijacked accounts being used to spread bulletin board spam for some advertising revenue. According to this interview with a phisher, phishers also logged in to the email accounts of the profile owners to harvest financial account information. In any case, phishing MySpace became profitable enough (more than phishing more traditional targets) that many of the active phishers began targeting it.MySpacethis interview with a phisherInterestingly, the attack vector for this new attack appeared to be MySpace itself, rather than the usual email spam. To observe the phishers' actions, we fed them the login information for a dummy MySpace account. We saw that when phishers compromised a MySpace account, they added links to their phishing page on the stolen profile, which would in turn result in additional users getting compromised. Using a quirk of the CSS supported in MySpace profiles, the phishers injected these links invisibly as see-through images covering compromised profiles. Clicking anywhere on an infected profile, including on links that appeared normal, redirected the user to a phishing page. Here's a sample of some CSS code injected into the \"About Me\" section of an affected profile:botnetslist of recommendations\n                        Google",
