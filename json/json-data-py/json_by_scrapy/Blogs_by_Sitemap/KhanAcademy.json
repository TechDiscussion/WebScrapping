Our mission is ambitious, and we can‚Äôt do it alone. We need great explainers to create instructional videos, practice exercises, and reference articles to contribute to our growing library of content. That‚Äôs why we ran the Khan Academy Talent Search again in the US and Canada this June ‚Äì to find great video creators and amplify their voices. (We‚Äôve also got a talent search in India! Click here for information.) We asked this year‚Äôs contestants to focus on a range of subjects from biology and psychology to geography and statistics. We received 1,300 video applications, and were blown away by the quality, passion, and ingenuity. After reviewing all applications, we selected ten winners: one overall winner and nine finalists. We were looking for videos that explain academic concepts with clarity and depth, are friendly and conversational, and laser-focused on helping students when they most need guidance ‚Äì whether they are learning a concept for tomorrow‚Äôs test, completing their homework, or reviewing what they learned in class. These 10 videos clearly exemplify these qualities: Overall winner ‚Äì Alison Caldwell: Parts of the Brain Finalist ‚Äì Abraham Feinberg: Nature vs. Nurture ‚Äì Part 1 Finalist ‚Äì Alexandra Evans: Writing in the Ancient Near East Finalist ‚Äì Brian Macon: Confidence Intervals and Central Limit Theorem Finalist ‚Äì Jay Lin: Neurotransmitters Finalist ‚Äì Kelly Squires: Plate Tectonics Finalist ‚Äì Robert Lochel: Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit Tests Finalist ‚Äì Ron Maxwell: Moon phases explained ‚Äì middle school level Finalist ‚Äì Steve Yang: Bernoulli‚Äôs Equation Revisited Finalist ‚Äì Sonal Nalkur: Gender, Norms, and Occupations Scroll down to see all 10 videos. The overall winner receives a $3,000 cash prize and finalists receive $300. All winners are considered for content creation opportunities at Khan Academy. Although our talent search is over in the US and Canada, we‚Äôre still looking for great creators to bring content to learners around the world. Check out our careers page for current job openings on our content team. ¬†As previously mentioned, we‚Äôre running an India Talent Search to identify great video creators who can create content aligned to India‚Äôs academic standards. Check out the 10 winning videos! Overall winner Alison Caldwell: Doctoral student in neuroscience Parts of the Brain Alison‚Äôs video description: The brain is a complex organ, and even though it all kinda looks the same, it turns out that different parts of the brain do different things. In this video, we‚Äôll go over all of the major parts of the brain, including the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. And we‚Äôll even cover some of the other structures that get taken for granted. Get ready to fall in lobe! Why we selected this video as the overall winner: ‚ÄòParts of the brain‚Äô covers the academic concepts deeply and rigorously, and Alison‚Äôs delivery throughout the video feels friendly and conversational while staying focused on what a student needs to know for class. You might have guessed that one of the reasons we selected this video as the overall winner is its high production values (engaging special effects, beautiful brain illustrations, etc.). While these certainly make the video enjoyable to watch, high production values aren‚Äôt a factor in our scoring. We look for videos that display exceptional clarity, approachability, and a focus on student needs ‚Äì all qualities this video exemplifies. Check out more videos by Alison. Meet our nine Talent Search finalists! Abraham Feinberg: College science teacher and data analyst Nature vs. Nurture ‚Äì Part 1 Abraham‚Äôs video description: Are your behaviors a fixed, inevitable result of your genes? Or are they the result of the people and objects that surround you? In this video, we‚Äôll take a first look at the concept of Nature vs. Nurture, and we‚Äôll try to get a beginning idea of why it‚Äôs such an important issue in many different areas of psychology (and everyday life!). Check out more videos by Abraham. Alexandra Evans: Policy instructor, Foreign Service Institute Writing in the Ancient Near East Alexandra‚Äôs video description: People have been drawing pictures for tens of thousands of years, but when did we really start to write things down? How did we develop written words from pictures? In this video, we‚Äôll take a look at the very first writing systems, Sumerian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, and we‚Äôll trace how pictures evolved into written words. Check out more videos by Alexandra . Brian Macon: Full-time faculty, full-time father and husband, part-time PhD student Confidence Intervals and Central Limit Theorem Brian‚Äôs video description: What is the connection between the Central Limit Theorem and Confidence Intervals? In this video we will use a computer simulation to answer that question. The simulation will help us visualize the nature of sampling distributions as we begin our conversation about using estimates to make future predictions. Check out more videos by Brian . Jay Lin: Medical student and educational video producer Neurotransmitters Jay‚Äôs video description: How exactly do drugs affect the brain? This video will go over the normal chemical signaling in brain cells, and then explore the different ways drugs can change this normal signaling. Kelly Squires: Retired middle school teacher Plate Tectonics Kelly‚Äôs video description: Whether we‚Äôre aware of it or not, the earth‚Äôs crust is in a constant state of motion. A whole lot of colliding, dividing and sliding of massive chunks of lithosphere called plates, is happening very slowly but surely, right this very second. The reason for this remarkable movement is plate tectonics. In this video, we‚Äôll explore the cause of plate tectonics, the major plates found throughout the earth and the various landforms such as mountain ridges, valleys, volcanoes and faults that result from the plates‚Äô movement. Robert Lochel: High school math teacher Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit Tests Robert‚Äôs video description: Are hospital births equally distributed through the week, or are some days more likely? A chi-squared goodness-of-fit hypothesis test is used to compare the variability present in the data to what could reasonable occur by chance alone, and the big ideas behind these categorical tests are explained. Check out more videos by Robert. Finalist: Ron Maxwell: Middle school science teacher Moon phases explained- middle school level Ron‚Äôs video description: A simple talk to help you learn the phases of the moon and the way the moon phases happen‚Ä¶ Check out more videos by Ron. Finalist: Sonal Nalkur: Visiting Assistant Professor of Sociology at Emory University Gender, Norms, and Occupations Sonal‚Äôs video description: Why do some occupations seem to have a higher proportion of men or women? And does a person‚Äôs gender always have implications in the workplace? Many sociologists are curious to understand the reasons why the labor market looks the way it does. We also want to understand the specifics about why some people might be excluded or treated differently in the workforce. In this video, you‚Äôll be introduced to some of the concepts that allow sociologists to ask bigger questions about how gender might operate in various occupations. Finalist: Steve Yang: Recent graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Bernoulli‚Äôs Equation Revisited Steve‚Äôs video description: Engineering principles are often built upon concepts that you may have already learned in math and physics. In this video, we‚Äôll see how we can adapt and expand the energy form of the Bernoulli‚Äôs Equation to the hydraulic head form to better suit the needs of engineers.

Sin embargo, estamos a medio camino. Mientras continuamos expandiendo nuestros esfuerzos en los Estados Unidos y en otros pa√≠ses, es importante que nuestros recursos de alta calidad sean accesibles para cualquiera. A pesar de las tendencias globales que indican que las personas est√°n entrando al mundo digital m√°s r√°pido que nunca antes , todav√≠a existen dos principales barreras para lograr el acceso global a la educaci√≥n en l√≠nea: infraestructura b√°sica y costo de datos de navegaci√≥n.

Por eso, estamos compartiendo los principios de nuestro programa de alianzas con un profundo compromiso en poner a los estudiantes primero y estamos emocionados en colaborar con socios que creen que los servicios p√∫blicos, como la educaci√≥n, son cr√≠ticos para avanzar en el crecimiento humano, econ√≥mico, y social. Los principios de la alianza tasa cero de Khan Academy Estamos colaborando con operadores de telecomunicaciones para que Khan Academy sea tasa cero en dispositivos m√≥viles. Esto significa que nuestros aliados no cobrar√°n datos de navegaci√≥n a los usuarios. Nosotros exploramos estas oportunidades de forma puntual. Compartimos y hemos adaptado muchos de nuestros principios directamente de Wikimedia y estamos interesados en desarrollar alianzas y colaboraciones con otras organizaciones educativas sin fines de lucro interesadas en incrementar el acceso en formas similares. Nos regimos por los siguientes principios cuando consideramos llevar a cabo una alianza: ‚Äì Cl√°usula de no competencia: El objetivo principal de Khan Academy es proveer acceso a recursos educativos de alta calidad y gratuitos. Estamos interesados en ayudar a organizaciones con la misma misi√≥n no comercial de concretar esto ‚Äì Los operadores no tienen control editorial de nuestro contenido: El contenido es creado y seleccionado por Khan Academy, en asociaci√≥n con nuestros aliados. Los operadores no tienen control sobre qu√© contenido ofrecemos. Ning√∫n operador tiene derechos exclusivos perpetuos ‚Äì Nuestro objetivo es maximizar el acceso del estudiante, y como tal no ofrecemos derechos exclusivos en perpetuidad a ning√∫n operador, nunca: Esperamos asociarnos con muchos operadores alineados a nuestra misi√≥n para maximizar el impacto para los estudiantes ‚Äì Licencia de uso de marca limitada: Los operadores obtienen una licencia para usar nuestra marca para promover Khan Academy. Ellos no pueden usar nuestras marcas para sugerir que est√°n patrocinados, aprobados o apoyados por Khan Academy ‚Äì Sin recolecci√≥n de informaci√≥n personal: Los operadores reciben direcciones IP que ser√°n tasa cero solo para identificar apropiadamente el tr√°fico en Khan Academy.

Esperamos poder compartir nuestros aprendizajes. Estamos particularmente interesados en aprender qu√© tan viables son este tipo de programas durante los pr√≥ximos cinco a diez a√±os, mientras el costo por datos m√≥viles baje y el acceso a Internet aumente. Por ahora, estamos emocionados en incrementar el acceso de una forma peque√±a pero importante para los estudiantes en M√©xico. Los usuarios Telcel en M√©xico ahora pueden navegar en Khan Academy en dispositivos m√≥viles a trav√©s de es.zero.khanacademy.org o en nuestras aplicaciones para Android y iOS llenas de ejercicios, videos y art√≠culos de un amplio rango de materias.

English We‚Äôre making continual progress toward our mission of providing a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. Our content and products help millions of students and teachers around the globe find, practice and explore academic skills at their own pace and on their own terms. But we‚Äôre only part way there. As we continue expanding our efforts in the US and beyond, it‚Äôs critical our high-quality resources be accessible to everyone. And despite global trends that indicate people are coming online faster than ever before , there are still two major barriers to equalizing global access to online education: basic infrastructure and the cost of data. At Khan Academy, we‚Äôre dedicated to reducing barriers to equal access to education. Today, Telcel customers in Mexico can access Khan Academy‚Äôs mobile apps in Spanish and the website es.zero.khanacademy.org without consuming data from their pre-paid and post-paid plans, thanks to partnership with Carlos Slim Foundation and Telcel. Data costs alone should not limit access to a basic education, which we believe is a fundamental human right. This is the first effort in what we imagine can be something bigger: learners around the globe with access to a free, 24/7 tutor, right in the palm of their hands. We won‚Äôt get there without the help of mission-aligned partners around the globe. As such, we‚Äôre sharing our program principles to signal both our deep commitment to putting learners first and our excitement to collaborate with partners who believe public services like education are critical for advancing human, economic and societal growth. Khan Academy Zero Rating Partnership Principles We‚Äôre collaborating with telecom carriers to zero rate Khan Academy on mobile devices. This means our partners sponsor data charges to make them free for learners. We examine these opportunities opportunistically. We share and have adapted many of these principles directly from Wikimedia and are interested in developing partnerships and collaborations with other education nonprofits interested in increasing access in similar ways. We abide by the following principles when considering a partnership: ‚Äì Non-competitive clause: Khan Academy‚Äôs main goal is to provide access to high-quality educational resources free of charge. ¬†We‚Äôre interested in helping ensure organizations with the same non-commercial mission can do so as well. ‚Äì Carriers do not have editorial control of our content: Content is created and curated by Khan Academy, in association with our partners. Carriers have no control over what content we deliver. No carrier has perpetual exclusive rights. ‚Äì Our goal is to maximize access for the learner, and as such we do not offer exclusive rights in perpetuity to any carrier, ever: We hope to partner with many mission-aligned carriers to maximize the impact for learners. ‚Äì Limited trademark license: Carriers get a license to use our trademarks to promote Khan Academy. They cannot use Khan Academy trademarks to suggest they are sponsored, approved, or endorsed by Khan Academy. ‚Äì No collection of personal information: Carriers receive the IP addresses of sites that will be zero-rated only to appropriately identify Khan Academy traffic. Carriers cannot collect personally-identifiable information about our learners beyond monitoring which of their users is using Khan Academy. ‚Äì No commercial bundling: Access to Khan Academy through zero-rating programs cannot be part of or combined with a carrier‚Äôs commercial bundle. As a non-profit, we will be closely watching the impact this program has on learners in Mexico. We look forward to sharing what we learn. We‚Äôre particularly interested in learning how viable these kind of programs will be over the course of the next five to ten years as the cost of data declines and access to the Internet increases. For now, we‚Äôre thrilled to increase access in a small but meaningful way for learners in Mexico. Telcel users in Mexico can now access Khan Academy on mobile devices via es.zero.khanacademy.org or our Android and iOS apps, complete with exercises, videos and articles across a wide range of subjects. This work would not have been possible without generous support from our partners, the Carlos Slim Foundation and Telcel.

Start getting ready for the SAT today! We think a 115-point score gain can make a real difference when applying to college. If you don‚Äôt have 20 hours to practice, don‚Äôt worry. Shorter periods of time also correlate with meaningful score gains. Six hours of study on Official SAT Practice is associated with an average 90-point increase‚Äîno small bump. We‚Äôre also excited that more than 16,000 students from the class of 2017 who used Official SAT Practice improved their scores by more than 200 points. Way to go! Together with the College Board‚Äîthe maker of the SAT‚Äîwe studied data from nearly a quarter million high school students from the graduating class of 2017 who took the PSAT/NMSQT and the new SAT in the past year. Score gains were consistent across genders, family income levels, races, ethnicities, high school GPAs, and parental education levels. Since its launch in 2015, Khan Academy‚Äôs free Official SAT Practice has been used by more than 3.7 million students. We‚Äôre glad so many people are finding it helpful! * Nearly 40% of all test takers report using our free Official SAT Practice, making it the number one tool for SAT prep. * Twice as many students report using Khan Academy as paying for commercial test prep. Khan Academy and the College Board developed Official SAT Practice to create personalized tools to help all students, regardless of income level or background, prepare for the SAT and college-level courses. Official SAT Practice reinforces what students are learning in school by helping them focus on the knowledge and skills most essential for college.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Half a million lines of Go", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/half-a-million-lines-of-go/", "abstract": "By Kevin Dangoor Back in December 2019, I first wrote about Goliath , Khan Academy‚Äôs project to migrate our backend from a Python 2 monolith to services written in Go, along with other changes needed to make that journey. I also wrote about how we‚Äôre making this change as incrementally as can be . When we started Goliath, no one on the team knew Go beyond the experiments we ran to validate that Go would be a better choice for us than our other options. Today, all of our backend and full-stack engineers write Go, and our incremental delivery of Goliath has vaulted us over a big milestone: More than 500,000 lines of Go now running in production. This seemed like a good point to reflect on Go itself. Our engineers like Go I asked for some open-ended responses from engineers about Go, and I heard feedback like ‚Äúit‚Äôs easy to read and write,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI like Go more the more I work with it!‚Äù One engineer had spent years in .NET land and valued exception-style error handling, which is quite different from Go‚Äôs error handling. In case you‚Äôre not familiar with the topic, Go errors are values returned from functions that could have error conditions. Our former .NET engineer now says, ‚ÄúBeing able to call a function that doesn‚Äôt return an error and know for sure that it must succeed is really nice.‚Äù Another engineer cited Go‚Äôs standard library documentation . He loves ‚Äúthat it‚Äôs available via e.g. go doc io.Writer for internetless browsing. 5/5 best documentation, would read again.‚Äù Renee French‚Äôs gopher mascot also won praise for bringing fun and cuteness to the language. In general, Go tooling is fantastic. The compiler is quick, and having formatting being a part of the standard toolchain helps eliminate most conversations about formatting. Though I still see grumbles on the internet about Go modules, they work better than previous package management approaches in Go and, at this point, nicely overall in our experience. We‚Äôve also had no trouble finding tools and libraries for things we needed to accomplish, like gqlgen . We want generics, and Go is a bit more verbose otherwise Most of the time, writing Go code without generic types is fine. Most of the time, but there are plenty of times when we‚Äôve been writing internal library code or even just working with slices when we felt their absence. Lack of generics was the biggest complaint people had about Go. The engineers I surveyed appreciated the fact that the Go team has taken the time to make generics that fit Go, and we‚Äôre excited that the work is moving forward. At least we‚Äôll only be a couple years into our use of Go when they‚Äôre released. While porting Python code, an engineer noted that certain language constructs took more effort to write in Go, but that Go‚Äôs relatively fewer language features made the code more consistent and quicker to read. For one part of our system, we needed 2.7x lines of Go to handle the same features as our Python code, though a portion of this was due to replacing some function calls with cross-service queries. Another engineer wanted to be able to make better use of higher-order functions, and the proposed slices package looks like a nice addition along these lines. Ultimately, we‚Äôre looking to write a bit less code, and the options we get with generics will help with that. Performance and concurrency Coming from Python (Python 2 , no less), we have found Go‚Äôs performance to be excellent. We are doing as close to a 1:1 port as possible from Python to Go, while still ending up with something Go-like at the end, rather than code that looks like Python-in-Go. In the process, we‚Äôre explicitly not prioritizing performance work, unless there‚Äôs a real regression. One engineer noted that certain bulk data changes used to produce around 100 Google Cloud Datastore contention warnings per hour in the Python version and has close to zero in the Go version, because of how much quicker it is at processing the data. We have an outlier case of a class containing 1,000 students that could take 28 seconds to load in Python, but only 4 seconds in Go. Though we‚Äôre doing a straight port from largely single-threaded Python, we do make some uses of Go‚Äôs concurrency features already. One engineer noted that though channels were a much-highlighted feature of Go, we‚Äôve used the features of the sync package far more than channels. It will be interesting to see if our preferences change over time. Go after 500,000 lines To summarize: Yep, Go is more verbose in general than Python‚Ä¶ But we like it! It‚Äôs fast, the tooling is solid, and it runs well in production Our engineers come from a variety of programming backgrounds, so we certainly do have a diversity of opinion on Go vs. other languages. That said, Go is doing the job we ‚Äúhired‚Äù it to do when we started Goliath, and we‚Äôre thankful for the team driving its continued evolution and the community that has built up around it!

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Why we switched to Airflow for pipeline orchestration", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/why-we-switched-to-airflow-for-pipeline-orchestration/", "abstract": "By Tom Yedwab Introduction When we last discussed Khan Academy‚Äôs data pipeline management system, we shared our homegrown orchestration tool called Khanalytics and the progress we had made toward centralizing data management tasks in one tool. In the three years since, the Data Infrastructure team has grown in size and responsibility, and we have made a lot of changes. The biggest change was to stop development on Khanalytics and deprecate it in favor of the open-source project Apache Airflow . We‚Äôve integrated this technology as a core component of a new system that we have dubbed ‚ÄúKhanflow‚Äù . In this post I will talk a bit about why and how we made the transition. Deciding to switch to Airflow Before talking about the implementation, I want to describe the decision-making process because in my mind it is just as important. Way back in 2016 ‚Äî before embarking on the multi-year journey of development on Khanalytics ‚Äî we did a survey of the existing tools and identified Airflow as the most likely option for integrating a third-party solution. However, it was a very new project at the time and we decided it was not robust and capable enough for our needs. So we built our own, knowing that the data tooling landscape was moving quickly and our own understanding of our needs would change. So the question becomes: when to re-evaluate? When you have developed your own software tooling, it is easy to fall into one of two traps: on one hand, there is the sunk cost fallacy of continuing investing in a tool because of the time invested and the inherent customization for the team‚Äôs specific needs. On the other hand, there is a temptation to jump to the latest up-and-coming technology, especially if there is excitement and momentum around a particular project, only to spend a considerable investment getting to feature parity or discovering hidden deficiencies. Adopting Airflow would be a significant investment, so why not continue to invest in making our own tool better? The short answer is that as a small Data Infrastructure team, our mission is not to develop the perfect tooling but rather to ensure the rest of the company has timely, reliable access to the data and metrics they need. Indeed, this emphasis on efficiency in serving the needs of our product users is consistent with Khan Academy‚Äôs engineering philosophy. The more time we spend on the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù stuff ‚Äî running scheduled data pipelines ‚Äî the less time we can spend on more complex and technical needs. And what we discovered is that developing and maintaining a pipeline orchestration platform in the cloud takes considerable ongoing investment, while community-supported projects such as Airflow are rapidly improving and becoming easier to manage every year. So, does Airflow meet our needs as well as or better than our own custom solution? When we investigated, we found: Solid and growing community support (a key feature when evaluating open-source projects), A broad set of supported clouds and tools, so our favorite Google Cloud products such as BigQuery (for running analytics queries) and Dataflow (for running data pipelines) are supported out of the box, Fully managed options such as Astronomer and Google Cloud Composer , Solid support for both hosting in Kubernetes and for running tasks using KubernetesPodOperator in similar ways to Khanalytics pipelines. Implementation The first stage in any project like this is a proof-of-concept, which was made easier with Cloud Composer. In one click of a button, we had a working Airflow deployment and could start running pipelines (‚ÄúDAGs‚Äù or Directed Acyclic Graphs in Airflow parlance). We experimentally ported a few common pipeline types and started building out a proposed plan for what we would need to build around Airflow to make it a fully-supported alternative to Khanalytics. Some of the earliest decisions we had to make were about best practices; as a highly configurable and customizable tool, Airflow can be used in many different ways. For example, when running a BigQuery SQL query we could either use the built-in BigQueryOperator (which runs directly in the worker container) or use KubernetesPodOperator to launch our custom Docker image as we would do in Khanalytics. We went with the latter for this use case and felt validated by examples of others advocating strict adherence to this approach . For simple tasks such as sending an HTTP request we opted to use the built-in operators instead. When it became clear that porting existing pipelines was relatively easy and maintaining the environment was much less work than our own custom infrastructure, we focused on the needs not directly provided by Airflow, including: 1. Wrappers for DAG() and commonly-used operators. Since pipelines are just Python objects in Airflow, we can create base classes that define reasonable defaults, enforce constraints, and add custom functionality. The Data Infrastructure team maintains these and updates them in response to common issues and needs we see. Rather than invoking KubernetesPodOperator directly, we create a wrapper for each of our Docker images that takes explicit parameters which are then passed to the image as environment variables. 2. A CI/CD pipeline to lint, test, and deploy pipelines to production. We use a GitHub repository to version all our pipelines, including the associated queries and scripts. These files all need to be synced to Airflow, but only after passing some simple checks ‚Äì for instance, the Python code needs to parse correctly, otherwise the pipeline will disappear from the Airflow UI and stop running. We run these checks in a GitHub Action , which integrates with our pull-request based review and deployment process. Once merged to master, pipeline code is continuously synced from GitHub so we do not need to rebuild the Airflow image to deploy a pipeline. We also have a separate GitHub repository for the Airflow configuration itself and the commonly-used Docker images. This has a separate CI/CD process which builds the images and runs some test pipelines in the production Airflow cluster against the new images. Once checks pass we update a version file in Google Cloud Storage causing all future pipeline runs to use the new image version. 3. A development environment for running Airflow locally. While we initially set up a test Airflow deployment for iterating on pipelines, copying pipeline files into the cloud on every change quickly became too slow and cumbersome, and coordinating with others to share a single environment was limiting. There isn‚Äôt currently a single supported way to run Airflow on a local machine, so we developed a script which automatically sets up a Python virtual environment, installs dependencies, sets up a local Postgres database, and then runs the Airflow webserver and scheduler. While it isn‚Äôt perfect, it is good enough for non-engineers to build and iterate on pipelines quickly. With this same environment we can run individual pipeline tasks for even quicker iteration and also run our custom linter. 4. A set of Google Cloud service accounts to limit pipeline access to data. Some of our pipelines access more sensitive data than others. While there is no built-in security model for Airflow pipelines, we have limited the access of the default service account that pipelines run with to a reasonable minimum, and require that access to more sensitive data explicitly use a specifically-privileged service account. Example pipeline To illustrate how we‚Äôve customized Airflow into our own Khanflow system, here is a trivial example running a custom Python script: example_python.py # An example pipeline using Airflow\npipeline = KhanflowPipeline(\n    'example',\n    'Example pipeline',\n    'Infrastructure',\n    default_args,\n    datetime(2020, 9, 18),\n    slack_channel_to_notify='infrastructure-data')\n\n\n# A task which runs a Python script\na = KhanflowPythonOperator(\n    pipeline,\n    task_id=\"script\",\n    app=pipeline.path(\"script.py\"),\n)\n\n# A task which runs a SQL query and writes to a table\nb = KhanflowBigQueryOperator(\n    pipeline,\n    task_id=\"query\",\n    query=[ pipeline.path(\"bigquery.sql\") ],\n    variables={ \"timestamp\": \"{{ ts }}\" },\n    dataset=\"khanflow_stats\",\n    table=\"example_bigquery\",\n)\n\n# Add a dependency so \"b\" only runs after \"a\"\na >> b Naturally, script.py and bigquery.sql are a Python script and BigQuery query both checked into the same pipeline repository in the same directory as the pipeline itself. In this example we use three helper classes: KhanflowPipeline , KhanflowPythonOperator , and KhanflowBigQueryOperator . KhanflowPipeline is a wrapper for Airflow‚Äôs DAG which provides some default values and functionality but also adds a new required parameter ‚Äì the team which owns the pipeline ‚Äì as well as some optional parameters such as the Slack channel to notify on failure. KhanflowPythonOperator is a bit more interesting. Internally, it uses KubernetesPodOperator to start a pod in the same cluster running our pre-built Python image. In production, an init container runs first using git-sync to fetch the pipeline repository into a shared volume so that when the main container runs it can look up the script filename that is passed in as an environment variable. Running in a separate container like this allows us to install whatever Python dependencies we want which may be incompatible with libraries that Airflow needs for its worker images. This is all well and good for production, but how does this pipeline work in our development environment? We do not currently expect pipeline authors to be running a Kubernetes environment locally, so when the pipeline is run locally we still run the pods in the cloud, in our test GKE cluster. Since we want to run the pod with the latest local version of script.py , we package up any local changes in an archive and upload the archive to GCS where the running pod can pull it instead of pulling from GitHub. This approach is a bit clunky, but has the benefit of more closely resembling the production environment and not requiring us to store cluster secrets on the author‚Äôs machine. KhanflowBigQueryOperator is very much like its Python counterpart. It can handle both inline queries and files, it can concatenate multiple queries, and it can interpolate variables into a query such as timestamp in this instance. It also automatically adds labels to the query job so we can later extract per-pipeline and per-task metadata such as query costs for reporting purposes. Though we‚Äôve added a fair amount of customization, this pipeline is both straightforward to understand and should look very familiar to someone familiar with Airflow. Where we are now At this point we have a fully-functional Airflow deployment and are actively porting all existing pipelines, whether still running on Khanalytics or on a cron somewhere, to the new system. While Composer made it very easy to get started, we are currently hosting Airflow in our own GKE cluster using Terraform and Helm for added flexibility and this has also been straightforward to maintain. We recently upgraded to Airflow 2.0 which brings a lot of new features and performance improvements. Minor bugs do happen, however the developers are very responsive in GitHub and on Slack and there are usually straightforward workarounds. Most importantly, the system is very stable and we don‚Äôt see frequent failures that need to be diagnosed. So what is in store for the future of our pipeline architecture? We will continue to make the tool easier and more approachable. For our Data Insights team‚Äôs needs, we need to make scheduling a query as easy as using other tools such as BigQuery‚Äôs Scheduled Queries, so we can get the benefits of visibility and revision history for these queries as well. We are also planning to build a data lineage system to track data as it moves from upstream sources, through Airflow and onward to data dashboards and reports. Looking back we are very happy with our decision to adopt Airflow; it is solving a problem that is common across data infrastructure teams and we are glad to see many of these teams standardizing on a shared tool. Now we get to focus on the more interesting needs of our Data Insights team around building better learning metrics, conducting efficacy research, and improving and optimizing the experience of learners who depend on our product to succeed in their learning journey.

Read on for their top five tips. Tip 1: The best way to study is to practice. Schedule chunks of quiet time to practice on your own or with friends. Scheduling these sessions is important, otherwise they probably won‚Äôt happen on their own. Hold yourself accountable. If you miss a session, remember to schedule a makeup time. Build a habit of practice. Tip 2: Identify your strengths and weaknesses. Work on your weaknesses on a regular basis. You can do that quickly by using Khan Academy‚Äôs course challenges to see what areas you need to review. Then, head straight to those units, spend some time with the instructional material, and do the exercises. If you‚Äôre having trouble with the exercises, you can use our hints and rationales to understand what you are missing. The following AP courses have Course Challenges: AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College Calculus AB AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College Calculus BC AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College Statistics AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College Biology AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College Physics 1 AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College Computer Science Principles AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College US History AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College US Government & Politics AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College Macroeconomics AP¬ÆÔ∏é/College Microeconomics Tip 3: Practice your mental math. Find out if your AP exam allows calculators . If it doesn‚Äôt allow calculators, being able to quickly manipulate numbers in your head can be a huge advantage. One trick for multiplying or dividing numbers without a calculator is to first convert the numbers into scientific notation‚Äîthis can make the mathematical operations much simpler, as shown in this video . Tip 4: Schedule time to relax as well! You don‚Äôt want to get burned out before it‚Äôs time to take the exams themselves. Are you nervous about the exam? Check out Sal‚Äôs three tips for dealing with test taking anxiety . Tip 5: Break the tension right before you begin with an affirmation. When it‚Äôs time to take the exam or a practice test, say a positive affirmation to yourself right before you open the test booklet or look at the first question. You can say, ‚ÄúThis test is easy.‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm prepared and will do well.‚Äù Doing this can be a reminder that you‚Äôve put in the time to study and prepare for this test, and hopefully it will ease your stress right before you begin.", "date": "2021-04-06"},

We spoke with Megan Cohn, the creator of the course and Khan Academy‚Äôs biology content creator, about her career path, her advice for young people who are considering a career in science, and how teachers and students can use the new AP Biology course on Khan Academy . Khan Academy: What about the new AP Biology course makes you most excited? Cohn: I‚Äôm super excited about Units 6‚Äì8, which cover gene expression, natural selection, and ecology‚Äîthese are my favorite topics in biology. The units all have rigorous and engaging practice questions. The questions I wrote often present real research findings, show colorful images or diagrams, or are centered around interesting phenomena or cool locations. But in general, I‚Äôm most excited that students and teachers have a free resource that they can use to learn biology and prepare for the AP Biology exam. Khan Academy: What advice would you give to AP Biology teachers and students? Cohn: The AP Biology exam is coming up, so I suggest taking the Course Challenge (which you can find at the bottom of the course page) to see what areas you need to review. Then, head straight to those units, spend some time with the instructional material, and do the exercises. If you‚Äôre having trouble with the exercises, you can use our hints and rationales to understand what you are missing. Khan Academy: How did you get into science? Can you describe your career path? Cohn: I‚Äôve always loved biology, but it was my high school AP Biology class that really set me on the path to becoming a biologist. Thanks Mr. James! In college, I focused on marine biology and ecology. I even studied marine biology for a semester on a remote island in the Caribbean. This was a wonderful experience‚Äîevery day, I got to observe many different marine species in their natural habitats, including manta rays, reef squid, and even barracuda.. I learned that there are an infinite number of questions that can be asked about the natural world, and just as many different approaches to answering those questions, some of which are even fun! I got interested in molecular biology after college, when I started working in a lab that studied the molecules involved in how plants sense and respond to light. From that lab, I went to grad school and earned my PhD studying the molecular mechanisms of how certain bacteria cause diseases in plants. Super cool stuff! The biggest challenge I faced along the way was my own self-doubt. I had to work really hard to overcome the feeling that I didn‚Äôt belong or that I wasn‚Äôt smart enough to be a scientist, and I had to push forward even when I felt like giving up. I also became a parent while I was earning my PhD. There wasn‚Äôt a lot of support built into my program for new parents, so that was a challenging time. Khan Academy: What advice would you give to girls (and boys!) who are considering a career in science? Cohn: Anyone can learn science, and anyone can do science! No one is born with the knowledge and experience it takes to have a career in this field. Gaining this knowledge takes time and hard work, but if you are amazed by the world around you, then you can do it. Also, having some basic computer programming skills will help a lot. Because of the recent and amazing technological advances in how we can gather data, many projects involve huge data sets, so basic coding skills can really come in handy. Khan Academy: We hear you also worked as a pastry chef. Were there any lessons you learned as a pastry chef that apply to your job as a scientist? Cohn: I worked as a pastry chef in the Bay Area for about 5 years, between attending college and grad school. One of the biggest lessons I learned that applies to my job today is the importance of attention to detail. A missed detail when baking could lead to a flat souffle, and a missed detail in content creation can lead to a frustrated student. So, I work hard to pay attention to detail in all the work I do. A great life lesson I learned is how to be comfortable with failure‚Äîit‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt get something exactly right the first time you try. Whether it‚Äôs making the perfect chocolate chip cookies, or completing a successful experiment in the lab, getting things right takes time and patience.", "date": "2021-03-16"},

The author, Viviana Beatriz MacManus, offers a Latin American feminist theory of justice that speaks to the power of women‚Äôs storytelling, resistance, and community. Diana, Legal Sign My Name to Freedom: A Memoir of a Pioneering Life by Betty Reid-Soskin During Betty Reid Soskin‚Äôs 96 years of living, she has witnessed a grand sweep of American history. She has been an active participant, along with so many other Americans, in shaping the country as we know it now. She is a Bay Area legend and is now the oldest living park ranger in the country, working at the Rosie the Riveter Museum in Richmond, CA. Stacey, People Operations & Philanthropy The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot This book tells the true story of a Black woman named Henrietta Lacks in Virginia whose cancer cells were studied without her or her family‚Äôs knowledge or consent. Henrietta died of cervical cancer, but her cells still live on today, and they have contributed to numerous scientific breakthroughs, such as the polio vaccine and IVF. This book opened my eyes to the role of racism in medical research through the previously untold story of Henrietta and her family. Julie, Philanthropy Young adult nonfiction Rad American Women A ‚Äì Z by Kate Schatz and Miriam Stahl This is a young adult book highlighting 26 women from American history, in fields spanning from sports to civil rights. This is one of my toddler‚Äôs favorite books to read during bedtime stories, even though it‚Äôs written for older kids. He loves the cool things the women do, and I love learning about the women who are underrepresented in our history books. Julia, Product team Contemporary fiction The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett Bennett‚Äôs gorgeously written second novel, an ambitious meditation on race and identity, considers the divergent fates of twin sisters born in the Jim Crow South, after one decides to pass for white. I learned a great deal about what it was like to live as a Black woman in the U.S. from the 1960s through 1990s and what that experience looked like for a woman passing as white. As a white woman, I haven‚Äôt experienced either of these things, but wanted to understand. Diana, Product team Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo This is a Man Booker winning novel that follows the intertwining lives of Black women in Britain from different cultural backgrounds and generations over the course of several decades. The novel was a tour de force. In an NPR interview, Evaristo said, ‚Äúthere are very few Black British novels getting published‚Äù and that she wanted to fit in as many Black British stories as possible. Every character is complex and flawed, but each is dealt with kindly and with a lot of empathy. Personally, I walked away with a better appreciation of the diversity of lived experiences of Black women in Britain and how the legacy of Britain‚Äôs colonial history in Africa and the Caribbean has passed on through generations. Stephanie, Marketing The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience‚Äîby ideals, passion and circumstance‚Äîeach embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France. Yes, this is a fictional novel and there are some criticisms that it‚Äôs a bit cliche and over-exaggerated, but what I loved about this novel was how it showed and celebrated the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. I especially love this quote: ‚ÄúMen tell stories. Women get on with it. For us it was a shadow war. There were no parades for us when it was over, no medals or mentions in history books. We did what we had to during the war, and when it was over, we picked up the pieces and started our lives over.‚Äù Meagan, U.S. District Partnerships The Giver of Stars by Jojo Moyes A fictional book where five women‚Äîincluding an unhappily married English woman and the feisty daughter of a criminal‚Äîbecome Kentucky horseback librarians and find their lives transformed along the way. If you need to balance your nonfiction reading with some lighter fiction, this might be the ticket. The book was inspired by a real program First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt started in 1934 to aid and educate people in Appalachia during the Depression, called the Pack Horse Library Project. A group of librarians, mostly women, would ride up to 20-mile routes in the Kentucky mountains, delivering books to people and families. Diana, Product team Classic fiction Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston A fictional story about Janie Crawford, a Black woman who makes her way in 20th century Florida. Following Janie‚Äôs life provided me with a blueprint for self-discovery‚Äîhow self-discovery happens over a lifetime, and how it happens alongside (and at times in spite of) male presence. Aimee, Khan Kids Little Women by Louisa May Alcott A coming-of-age novel originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869. Alcott based Little Women on her own early life with her three sisters. The novel explores timeless themes of love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America. Danielle, Marketing Mysteries with strong female leads. The Murder at the Vicarage by Agatha Christie I recommend any and all of the following strong female leads‚ÄîMiss Marple (Agatha Christie), Kinsey Milhone (Sue Grafton), Maisie Dobbs (Jacqueline Winspear), and Anna Pigeon (Nevada Barr). There are many more, but this list will get you started. All of these women are often underestimated, but they use their own strengths to find justice in their worlds.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Overcoming a false sense of security when using Flow types", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/overcoming-a-false-sense-of-security-when-using-flow-types/", "abstract": "by Jared Forsyth At Khan Academy, we‚Äôve been using Flow ever since we started using React Native in early 2017, and it‚Äôs far better than not having types. However, it‚Äôs an incomplete type system, and often large portions of code are riddled with any types. This can sometimes lead to a false sense of security, which is then burst when you get a runtime type error and think ‚Äúwait, I thought flow had my back!‚Äù Our solution to this problem is ‚Äúuncovered expression linting.‚Äù The end result is that, when you are reading over some code, you can be confident that flow is checking it for safety, except where explicitly indicated with ‚Äúlinter disable‚Äù comments. This greatly improves our ability to be confident in the soundness of our code, which frees up mental space for all the other parts of building a system. Type Coverage Now, flow has built-in ‚Äúcoverage reporting,‚Äù where you can see what percentage of your code is covered ‚Äî that is, verified as being ‚Äúsafe‚Äù by the type system. The opposite being code that is exempted from the type system, via any ‚Äî and any s are infectious if unchecked. Any function that you call that returns an any (either explicitly or implicitly) will result in a ‚Äústealth any‚Äù: at the callsite there‚Äôs nothing to indicate that the value you got back has been exempted from type safety. Similar to test coverage reporting, you can use this to ensure that your overall ‚Äúpercent type coverage‚Äù remains above a certain threshold. Unfortunately, this kind of metric is nearly useless. One major job of a static type checker is to give you confidence that your code is sound ‚Äî to free up your mental space from doing the work of type-checking code you‚Äôre reading, so that you can focus on other things. But if the code isn‚Äôt fully covered ‚Äî if it‚Äôs only 80% covered, for example ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt know when you‚Äôre reading some code just which parts aren‚Äôt covered, then the benefits of a static type checker are greatly reduced. You‚Äôre left with insecurity ‚Äî knowing that there are places in your code that are much more error-prone, but not knowing where they are. If you‚Äôre using VSCode with flow integration, then you can turn on inline coverage reporting ‚Äî code that is exempted from the type system gets underlined in a blue wavy line. This is much better than relying on a percentage, but still has two downsides. The first being that it doesn‚Äôt help for code reviews on github or your code review platform of choice. When reviewing someone else‚Äôs code, knowing what parts of it are ‚Äúmore dangerous‚Äù is quite important. The second and more fundamental issue is that there‚Äôs no way to indicate that a given expression or block of code is intentionally uncovered, and has been given the scrutiny it deserves. This is where linting comes in! The Solution Instead of a broad per-project or even per-file coverage percentage, we lint against any uncovered expression . For example, the following code would contain 5 linter errors (highlighted and underlined in red, each of them ‚Äúthis expression isn‚Äôt covered by flow‚Äù): 1| const liveDangerously = ( one : any, two): any => {\n2| ¬† return one + two;\n3| }\n4| const andSuch = () => {\n5| ¬† const theResult = liveDangerously(\"a\", \"b\") ;\n6| ¬† return theResult + \":yes\"\n7| } Notice how, without this linter, you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily know that using theResult was unsafe, because there‚Äôs nothing in the source to indicate it. Of course there are sometimes good reasons to have any typed code. JSON.parse , for example, rightfully has any as the return value. In cases such as these, however, having the linter encourages developers to add type annotations as early as possible, so as to minimize the number of ‚Äúlinter disable‚Äù comments that are needed. We‚Äôve been using flow coverage linting for the past two years, and we love it. We‚Äôre currently using a custom in-house linter, but we recently added uncovered expression linting to the ‚Äúflowtype errors‚Äù eslint plugin , which will enable us to get our flowtype coverage errors along with our other eslint reporting. If this sounds interesting to you, all it takes is npm i -D eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors and adding the following to your eslintrc : \"plugins\": [\"flowtype-errors\"],\n ¬†¬† \"rules\": {\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"flowtype-errors/uncovered\": \"error\",\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†... etc\n¬†¬†¬†¬†} And then you get this!

Khan Academy famously got started with Sal making videos in his closet to help his cousins with math. We‚Äôve kept a lot of that informal feel to our videos that Sal had back then, and we‚Äôve also looked to research to tell us how to make videos that are most likely to help students learn. A researcher named Rich Mayer, with his students and colleagues, has developed an entire program of research investigating how to best design digital learning experiences. They have a lot of guidance about making good videos that combine pictures, text, and audio. Here are some of the key areas we rely on: You‚Äôve Got a Friend I‚Äôm sure if you‚Äôre a regular Khan Academy user, you‚Äôve enjoyed the friendly, relaxed tone that Sal (and our other video narrators) use. It turns out that research suggests people learn better when narration is given in a conversational style, rather than a formal style. Learning is in many ways social. Researchers hypothesize that a more informal style of narration makes students feel like they have a partner in learning who is helping them, rather than someone who is judging them. Mayer calls this the personalization principle. You Can Only Process So Much Information at a Time Mayer‚Äôs research has found that people learn better when they control the pace of information and when it is viewed in pieces rather than one continuous unit. Based on this, Khan Academy learners can use speed controls, pausing, rewinding, and stopping as needed when watching videos. In addition, we‚Äôve broken content up into chunks, with videos averaging six to nine minutes so users get a natural pause between topics. Ideally, this is when learners do a practice exercise to apply what they saw in the videos. You Can Only Pay Attention to So Many Things at a Time It is more difficult for the brain to process written words and illustrations (two visual inputs) simultaneously, than it is to process spoken works and illustrations (one audio and one visual input). Therefore, if illustrations are important in the video, we try to keep text to a minimum. It is also difficult to process text and spoken words when they happen together but say different things. As a result, we try to make sure that the text we are writing on the screen matches the words being said in the narration at the time. Below is a screenshot from a lesson on ratios in our sixth grade math course. You can see the limited text, and in the video, Sal writes the words you see as he says them, so the narration matches the text. Where Should You Look? You know that little circle or cross that follows along as the narrator speaks? (See the cross next to ‚Äúlabor union‚Äù in the screenshot below that is circled in red.) That‚Äôs important for showing users where to focus. Often, screens contain a lot of information and it can be difficult to know where to look or what the narrator is referring to. This may not be a big thing, but pointing out where to focus helps us learn. Mayer calls it the signaling principle. So, given all of this, as you‚Äôre watching our videos: We hope you feel like we‚Äôre in this learning activity with you. Follow along with the visual cue of where to look. Know that we‚Äôre being thoughtful about matching text and audio. Focus on a video then do some practice exercises (instead of watching video after video after video). I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this four-part series on learning science at Khan Academy.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "How Should People Practice on Khan Academy?", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/how-should-people-practice-on-khan-academy/", "abstract": "The third in a four-part series about the science of learning by Kristen DiCerbo, chief learning officer. One of the key features of Khan Academy is our practice exercises. They provide the opportunity to use new skills you are learning, which is key to making sure you‚Äôll remember the skills in the future. Here‚Äôs what is most important to know about doing practice exercises: It‚Äôs OK to need help! For more than 100 years, educators have said that students learn the most when they are doing tasks that push them a little beyond what they know how to do independently, and require them to have a little support to be successful. If students can do the activity on their own without help, it‚Äôs probably too easy. At Khan Academy, we have two methods of providing help: hints that provide support while you are answering a question and rationales that provide support after you have submitted a response. Should you try the question first or use a hint first? Research actually provides some guidance! When you first approach a problem, ask yourself, ‚ÄúIs this familiar at all?‚Äù If not, go ahead and ask for a hint. But if it is a little familiar and you have some idea of what to do, try to answer it first before asking for a hint. It turns out that trying it first makes you really think about what you are doing, and that ‚Äúcognitive effort‚Äù helps us learn. Even if you are wrong, your brain is now tuned in to the problem and more likely to remember how to do it correctly next time. If there are multiple steps for a problem, our practice exercises usually include a hint for each step. You can go through this process of thinking about whether you know what to do for each step. Once you get a hint, take a moment to explain to yourself why the information provided helps solve the problem. For example, the problem below asks students to find the median, which takes two steps: putting the numbers in order and then finding the middle number.¬† If you take the first hint here, it reminds you of the first step. Then explain it to yourself, perhaps adding why you put the numbers in order first, ‚ÄúWe put the numbers in order so that when we find the middle one it will actually be the middle of all the numbers in order.‚Äù If you view all the hints you get what we call a ‚Äúworked example.‚Äù Worked examples are fully solved solutions. They provide people learning something new with an expert‚Äôs solution to the problem and are especially good for problems that can be broken down into step-by-step solutions. This relates to another way to use hints. If you go through all the hints provided so you can see all the steps plus the answer, don‚Äôt just plug in the answer! Instead, talk through the steps and explain them to yourself. This type of ‚Äúself-explanation‚Äù usually results in being able to do the same kinds of problems later because it builds pathways in the brain that help you remember. Many of our multiple choice questions also have what are called ‚Äúrationales.‚Äù These are the explanations for why an incorrect answer is not correct or why the correct answer is correct. Just as with hints, we know that learning happens when you take the time to read these rationales and create explanations for yourself, restating them in your own words. So, that is how to practice: Don‚Äôt be afraid to get help from hints and rationales if you need it. If you have some idea of how to answer a question, give it a try first. When you look at hints and rationales, explain the step or the reasoning to yourself in your own words.

At Khan Academy, we‚Äôre well known for our videos. But watching a video is ultimately a passive experience. On its own, a video doesn‚Äôt enable deep learning. So how does the learning happen? First, it‚Äôs important to know that Khan Academy provides opportunity for practice . Practice is important because: Students need¬†it in order to get fluent with skills they are learning. Fluent means being able to do something, like reading or solving math problems, accurately and quickly. Students need to practice not just doing a skill multiple times, but they also need practice deciding which skill to use when. For example, some word problems require subtraction and some require addition. We call this mixed practice. In addition to providing practice, we provide instruction . While no technology can ever replace a great teacher, technology can help when a teacher isn‚Äôt around or is helping other students. For example: Students, particularly those newly learning a skill, benefit from immediate help when they get stuck. Khan Academy provides on-demand hints and feedback on whether or not an answer is correct and why. We can provide instructional material at just the right moment when students are working on practice, so they can apply new learnings to immediately solve their problem. Our instruction can provide explanations in ways that are slightly different than how a text or teacher explains something. Sometimes that might be the explanation that clicks with learners who did not understand it another way. Now back to our videos. As I mentioned earlier, watching a video is ultimately a fairly passive activity. That means information is coming in, but we are not engaging with it. Learning research tells us that to actually learn something, we need to actively use the new information to help store it in our long-term memories. We need to explain new things to ourselves in our own words and practice applying new information in different scenarios to see when it‚Äôs appropriate and when it isn‚Äôt. When we are learning processes and procedures, the more we practice, the more the process becomes more automatic. When something becomes automatic, you don‚Äôt have to spend your brain‚Äôs energy figuring out how to do it; you can focus on other things. For example, practicing addition facts and times tables until they become automatic means when solving more complex problems, like long division, we don‚Äôt have to spend mental energy remembering what 7√ó8 is. As we get to more complex procedures, the same principle holds. More practice in factoring polynomial equations will make the steps to do it automatic, allowing us to focus on why we are doing it and applying it in the correct places. So, it is really the videos, articles, and practice on Khan Academy in combination that help students learn.

Learning is all about being able to apply new concepts and skills to solve problems. At Khan Academy, we provide instruction and practice with videos, articles, practice problems, and quizzes. But how are our resources designed to enable learning? We bring everything we know from decades of research about how people learn to the design of everything we do. What Are the Learning Sciences? People have been studying how we learn ‚Äî the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills‚Äì for years. Learning science falls in different academic disciplines including educational psychology, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and more recently, neuroscience. In addition, with the advent of digital learning, we‚Äôve included computer science, data science, and human-computer interaction. Together, all these fields make up the learning sciences. The goal of the learning sciences is to both better understand how people learn and to design and implement experiences that help people learn more effectively. What Are Some Big Topics in Learning Science That We Adhere to at Khan Academy? We look across years and years of research to find techniques that have consistently improved learning over many studies in different subject matters with different age groups from different demographic groups. Our work is deeply influenced by: Mastery learning: When a student is learning a new skill, research shows it‚Äôs most effective to work on that skill until the student is able to consistently apply it across multiple problems before moving on to the next skill. You can learn more from this video . More than 300 studies of mastery learning show it works. However, most schools are not designed to accommodate mastery learning. Instead they have a set schedule of topics and a set amount of time to spend on each topic, whether or not a student has learned it. The result can be lots of gaps for students who didn‚Äôt quite master the topic. When gaps accumulate, they can cause difficulty for months and years ahead. Using Khan Academy to supplement traditional curriculum can help fill these gaps. Practice with feedback: One of the most consistent findings in research about learning is that practicing with feedback leads to greater learning. Practice allows learners to manipulate and apply new information while feedback ensures learners are doing the work correctly. There has also been a good deal of work about what kinds of feedback best support learning and for whom. For example, for someone just beginning to learn something, immediate feedback that doesn‚Äôt just say if something is correct or incorrect, but explains why it leads to more learning. Motivation: Learning something new can be hugely rewarding, but the process itself can be challenging. Learning new things takes sustained effort over time, often in the face of obstacles. We all need help staying motivated. There is a lot of research we can draw on to help students stay motivated. One of the key theories in motivation research is called Expectancy-Value Theory . People are more likely to do things when they expect that they will be successful and when they value the thing they are doing. Expectancy-Value Theory guides how we think about motivation and the kinds of things we build in our experience to help learners learn. (Here‚Äôs an article I wrote about how to motivate students who are distance learning during COVID-19 .) So, follow along and I‚Äôll show you in my next three blog posts how we apply research and more to build Khan Academy so learners can achieve their goals and pursue their dreams.", "date": "2020-11-19"},

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Incremental Rewrites with GraphQL", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/incremental-rewrites-with-graphql/", "abstract": "Or, how to switch that foundation out from under your product while keeping it fully running By Kevin Dangoor Previously, I wrote about our ‚ÄúGoliath‚Äù project to rewrite Khan Academy‚Äôs 10-year-old monolithic Python 2 backend in modern Go. This blog post won‚Äôt go into the whys of the transition. If you‚Äôre interested in that, check out the earlier post . One bit of feedback I saw when writing previously about rewriting our backend in Go was along the lines of ‚Äúbig bang rewrites are unbelievably risky‚Äù. I agree with that! Today, I‚Äôm writing about how what we‚Äôre doing is essentially the opposite of a big bang rewrite. Federated GraphQL The hub of our new architecture is based on GraphQL federation . REST-based services have had ‚ÄúAPI gateways‚Äù for years, and federation provides the same function when your system is based on GraphQL. The big differences between the two are: GraphQL provides a single, typed schema for all of the data the backend systems can provide. REST API gateways generally know how to direct a request to a single backend service. GraphQL gateways generate a query plan to build up a response that includes data from multiple backend services At a high level, our system looks like this: The graphql-gateway service is responsible for creating the query plan and making GraphQL requests to our other services, including our monolith. Our Go services have their own GraphQL schemas, for which we use gqlgen to respond to requests. I‚Äôm going to focus on how we‚Äôve customized the Apollo GraphQL server to allow us to safely migrate from our Python 2 monolith to these new services. With GraphQL Federation, each service provides part of the overall GraphQL schema and the gateway merges all of these separate schemas together into one. Our monolith acts like any other service in this setup. Side-by-side testing GraphQL is based on types with fields . The code that knows how to look up the value of a field is called a resolver . Here‚Äôs the simple example we‚Äôll be using to talk about our approach: type Assignment {\n    createdDate: Time\n} There are a lot more fields involved in Assignments, but our approach is the same for all of them. Let‚Äôs say we want to move this field from the monolith to our new Go service. How can we be confident that the new service is returning the same data that the monolith did? We use an approach similar to GitHub‚Äôs Scientist library: query both the monolith and the new service and compare the results, but only return one of them. Step 1: The monolith is in control When a user requests the createdDate field, the graphql-gateway is going to make a request to the Python monolith. Our first step is to set things up so that we can add the field in the assignments service in Go. The assignments service will have something like this in a .graphql file: extend type Assignment @key(fields: \"id\") {\n    id: ID! @external\n\n    createdDate: Time @migrate(from: \"python\", state: \"manual\")\n} This is using federation to say that the service is adding the createdDate field to the Assignment type, and that field can be looked up using the id. The secret sauce we‚Äôve added is the @migrate directive. We‚Äôve written code that understands these directives to build up multiple schemas that the graphql-gateway will use when deciding how to route a query. In the ‚Äúmanual‚Äù state, the query will only go to the Python code. We use this while we‚Äôre writing a new service. Our engineers can still query the service directly for createdDate or can ask the graphql-gateway for the ‚Äúmanual‚Äù schema, but all bets are off as to whether or not that schema is actually going to work. Step 2: Side-by-side Once we‚Äôve built out the resolver code for the createdDate field, we switch the field over to side-by-side: extend type Assignment @key(fields: \"id\") {\n    id: ID! @external\n\n    createdDate: Time @migrate(from: \"python\", state: \"side-by-side\")\n} In this state, the graphql-gateway is going to call both the Python code and the new Go code. It will compare the results, log the instances where there‚Äôs a difference, and return the Python result to the user. This mode is really the key to building up confidence that the migration is going to work properly. We have millions of users and years of data. By seeing how this code works in the real world, we can verify that even weird edge cases are handled consistently and correctly. Here‚Äôs a sample report that shows counts of side-by-side differences: We do encounter cases where an non-deterministically ordered Python set yields a different result than the Go code. Over time, we‚Äôve learned to spot these sorts of issues which don‚Äôt represent user-visible problems. When working from our development servers, we also have tools that provide color highlighted diffs to make any variations easy to spot and understand. What about mutations? You may have picked up on a conundrum: If we‚Äôre running the same code in both Python and Go, what happens with code that changes data instead of just querying it? In GraphQL terms, these are called mutations . Our side-by-side tests don‚Äôt cover mutations. We had considered some approaches to allow this, but they were more complicated than we thought worthwhile. But we did come up with an approach that helps with this problem and more‚Ä¶ Step 2.5: Canary If we have a field or mutation that we think is ready, but we still want to do some production testing and validate the results, we have a ‚Äúcanary‚Äù mode for this. extend type Assignment @key(fields: \"id\") {\n    id: ID! @external\n\n    createdDate: Time @migrate(from: \"python\", state: \"canary\")\n} Fields and mutations in the ‚Äúcanary‚Äù state will be sent to the Go service for a runtime configurable percentage of our users. Plus, internal Khan Academy users will get the canary schema. This gives us a reasonably low-risk way to test more complex changes, because we can quickly turn off the canary schema if something is not working quite right. For efficiency‚Äôs sake, there‚Äôs only one canary schema. In practice, not many fields/mutations are in the canary state at any given time, so this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. This is a good tradeoff, because the schema is pretty large (more than 5,000 fields) and the gateway instances need to keep the primary, manual, and canary schemas in memory. Step 3: Migrated The next step on createdDate‚Äôs journey is to become ‚Äúmigrated‚Äù: extend type Assignment @key(fields: \"id\") {\n    id: ID! @external\n\n    createdDate: Time @migrate(from: \"python\", state: \"migrated\")\n} In this state, the gateway only sends the traffic to the Go service. The Python code is still there, ready to respond. This makes it easier to stage our deploys and roll back if something goes awry. Step 4: Python code removed Finally, we‚Äôre done with the Python code and can remove the @migrate directive entirely: extend type Assignment @key(fields: \"id\") {\n    id: ID! @external\n\n    createdDate: Time\n} At this point, the Assignment.createdDate field is only known to the gateway as coming from the assignments Go service. How has it been going? We built our side-by-side testing infrastructure this year, and it has allowed us to migrate a bunch of code to Go safely and in tiny steps. We‚Äôve maintained high availability during a year with a significant traffic increase and massive changes to our backend, web frontend, and mobile apps. As of this writing, ~40% of our GraphQL fields are now being served by Go services, so this technology has proven itself out for this migration. Even after the Goliath project is done, we‚Äôll be able to keep using this technique to shield our frontends from the inevitable changes that will come to our backend services over time.

Khan Academy: How long have you been using Khan Academy in your classroom? Moorman: I have been using Khan Academy for several years. Initially, I used it as an enrichment and monitoring tool for my own sons who have been using it for years. My high schooler benefits from the SAT prep and AP courses Khan Academy has to offer. Personally, I use it for . . . fun! Time permitting, I love to immerse myself in computer science, psychology, or art courses simply for the joy of learning. As an educator, I have been enjoying the benefits of Khan Academy with my students for several years. Creating a class and assigning individualized content for my students enables me to provide them with tools that target their needs, enable them to access quick tutorials, and provide immediate feedback. I appreciate the ability this platform offers to track my students‚Äô progress, which informs my subsequent instructional steps to best address their needs. Khan Academy: What results have you seen? Moorman: I love the sense of being in charge of one‚Äôs learning that Khan Academy helps develop in my students. Kids are excited to use this platform because of its learner-friendly design. You do not need to dwell on a skill that you have already mastered, and when help is needed, it is right there in a form of a quick and straightforward tutorial. Being in charge of navigating one‚Äôs learning path is empowering! Khan Academy: What is your favorite story or moment regarding the use of Khan Academy? Moorman: Hearing my students aptly identifying their strengths and challenges based on the platform‚Äôs immediate feedback is priceless. I strongly believe that Khan Academy helps me address the ‚ÄúI am not good in math‚Äù stigma that many students face. The user-friendly format of the platform with its digestible chunks allows my students to celebrate success as they complete sections within the course. This, consequently, empowers them to believe that they can excel. Khan Academy: What is it like to be named Teacher of the Year, and what does this honor mean to you? Moorman: Being selected teacher of the year is an unexpected and humbling experience. It feels great to be acknowledged by my coworkers! For someone like me who is constantly self-reflecting and self-imposing high expectations, receiving such a recognition is a greatly appreciated confirmation that I am doing alright. Khan Academy: What advice do you have for other teachers? Moorman: Time is always of value, even in virtual spaces. Keep that in mind when designing activities for your students (less is more!) as much as when you look at your own schedule. Strive to have a balanced work-to-personal life ratio. Don‚Äôt chastise yourself for making mistakes. Learn from them and move on. Be patient with yourself, your students, and their families. Remote learning and hybrid environments are new territories for all of us. Show grace and remain flexible.", "date": "2020-11-13"},

Khan Academy Romanian joins the over 30 Khan Academy language sites that already exist, and we are still expanding and adding new translated content (see below for the full list). The vast majority of these sites are translated and maintained by volunteers and international nonprofit organizations ‚Äì if you are interested in volunteering to translate for Khan Academy, learn more about our volunteer translator program . A note from the Romanian team We are very excited to announce the public launch of the Romanian version of the Khan Academy website. After around 7 years of sustained work from independent volunteers, we eventually managed to form a team that could bring the project to this state and which is supported by Invenovi (a non-profit organization looking for opportunities to develop education through innovation). We consider it a true honor to be able to offer Romanian speaking learners the valuable materials at Khan Academy. This achievement was only possible thanks to the enthusiasm of all the people who got invested in this project: parents inside and outside the country, young people, old people, teachers, educators and individuals with various other jobs. All of them were brought together after realising the importance of developing free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. At the moment, the only content published is for kindergarten and elementary school. But this is just the beginning of a new stage; a great deal of effort is being put into translating Maths, Science, Arts and Humanities. Anyone who believes in our cause can join the Romanian Translation Community either through volunteer work or financial support.

I‚Äôm Laker, a content intern at Khan Academy. I‚Äôm excited to announce on behalf of the math team that practice is coming to multivariable calculus! I still remember how hard it was to find organized, high quality practice when I took multivariable calculus. My textbook didn‚Äôt always include solutions to problems, for example, so I couldn‚Äôt be sure I had done a given question correctly. Worse, I sometimes got stuck halfway through and needed to wait days before I could ask my instructor for help. I struggled to find great resources to help me visualize concepts, which are a big part of what makes multivariable calculus beautiful and powerful. We designed the new exercises with all of these issues in mind to make multivariable calculus on Khan Academy an effective way to help anyone learn, practice, and master this wonderful branch of mathematics. What do I love most about the new multivariable calculus content? Comprehensive approach: The updated course covers content that is closely aligned to a typical first course in multivariable calculus. That makes it a powerful resource to supplement the many multivariable calculus courses that will be held online this fall‚Äînot to mention it‚Äôs a strong foundation for independent study. Instant feedback: Unlike practice questions in almost all other resources available for studying multivariable calculus, our problems give instant feedback. If a student is struggling, every problem has detailed hints to gently guide the student to the solution. Mastery: Students can repeat an exercise multiple times with fresh questions until they feel they have mastered the concept. They can also test their mastery with quizzes, unit tests, and the course challenge. Visual focus: We put special effort into building a number of exercises that help students develop a visual understanding of multivariable calculus. This leads to deeper conceptual learning, prepares students to connect their learning to other fields such as physics, and is much more fun than just manipulating symbols! We‚Äôre extremely proud of the work we‚Äôve done on the multivariable calculus course. Onward!", "date": "2020-09-23"},

The San Francisco Bay Area has proven fertile ground for a volunteer group contributing to make Khan Academy accessible in Burmese. ¬†A vibrant community of expatriates has settled in the area, and for some, coming together to translate KA videos is a natural extension of their activism for their homeland. ¬†This small but mighty group, spearheaded by Advocate Nyunt Than , finds strength in collaboration. ‚ÄúMany of us left Burma due to brutal oppression, so we are always thinking about helping the people back home,‚Äù relates Than. ¬†‚ÄúProjects like this are not the first time that we have come together as a community.‚Äù ¬†Than himself left the Burmese village of Kamase for Singapore in 1992 and moved to the US in 1996. ¬†Last winter, on his first trip back to Burma in 20 years, he spoke publicly about how Khan Academy can play a part in Burma‚Äôs education reforms. As an Advocate, Nyunt supports his tight-knit collective with encouraging words and holiday greetings via email, as well as by hosting weekly Google HangOuts. ¬†‚ÄúMany of us are not seasoned translators,‚Äù Than admits, ‚Äúbut are willing to do whatever we can to bring world-class education in to the hands of the millions of Burmese. ¬†So, we are diving into water though we don‚Äôt know how to swim well, but the experience will make all of us stronger and better translators as we learn and grow from each other.‚Äù ¬†In January, Nyunt visited Yangon and shared his community‚Äôs efforts with a broader audience of stakeholders. The Burmese volunteer community has focused mostly on subtitling, and Burma‚Äôs unique written language, while beautiful, has presented challenges. ¬†‚ÄúOur alphabet comes from Brahmi script and uses the shapes of the sun and the moon‚Äîvery round,‚Äù says Than. ¬†Unfortunately, the popular font used by most Burmese is not unicode-compliant and is thus not supported by Apple, Google and Microsoft. ¬†This has created headaches for subtitlers, one of several hurdles. ¬†Spotty Internet availability in Burma is another. ¬†Than notes that Khan Academy provides one way to work around this challenge: ‚ÄúWe are very interested in KA Lite as a way to connect communities throughout Burma.‚Äù", "date": "2014-02-08"},

With a rich environment of startups and¬†multinationals, ICT sector companies in Ireland are looking to hire over 44,500¬†technical workers in the next 6 years(1) ‚Äì a huge prospect in a country with 12%¬†unemployment and 1,000 Irish leaving every week to find work abroad (2). While the demand for highly skilled technical graduates is rising, Ireland‚Äôs¬†education system is not meeting the need. Ireland ranks around the bottom¬†third mark on international comparative exams for both Primary and Secondary¬†student performance in mathematics (3). Our team set out with the idea that by¬†making one small change ‚Äì by introducing a FREE training tool already used by¬†millions ‚Äì Ireland will top the global leaderboards in mathematics. That tool is Khan Academy. Where did it all begin? Last October, two National Education Centres started running free Saturday¬†Khan Academy math clubs on Saturday mornings. Today, 100 students attend¬†the club in Galway every Saturday, some carpooling over 2 hours just to¬†work on Khan Academy, and there is a perpetual waiting list for a spot. The¬†Khan Academy club model is spreading across the country: 20 additional¬†education centres have been trained on Khan Academy, and volunteer parents¬†of CoderDojo ( www.coderdojo.com ) have opened KA maths rooms in their¬†computer coding clubs. By the end of 2013, it was clear that Khan Academy had struck a chord with Irish¬†students, and our team decided it was time to take our awareness raising efforts¬†to the next level. Enter: the MATHletes Challenge. Building on Ireland‚Äôs strong athletics tradition, we launched the MATHletes¬†Challenge ‚Äì a national maths tournament for Ireland using Khan Academy. The¬†Challenge was open to primary and secondary individuals and schools across¬†5 grades. In just 3 months, over 3,000 students and 350 teachers from 276¬†schools signed up for the Challenge ‚Äì including 10% of Irish secondary schools. The Challenge captured the imagination of students and brought excitement,¬†engagement, and dedication to math that had never existed before. Radio¬†stations and newspapers profiled local MATHletes as celebrities, and weekly¬†leaderboards generated anticipation and buzz in schools and households across¬†Ireland. It appealed to students‚Äô (and teachers) basic competitive spirit ‚Äì and¬†the positive feedback generated by Khan Academy‚Äôs points, badges, and mastery¬†skills encouraged students to keep working. Top MATHletes were invited to in-person provincial and national final days,¬†which were filled with math challenges, fun, and prizes totaling over ‚Ç¨20,000. So what has the impact been? Students spent nearly a million minutes on Khan Academy over the course of the¬†competition. Students logged over 900 hours during the Easter break, and stayed¬†late after school and during lunch to work on Khan Academy. The Challenge¬†improved performance across ability levels. Not only were top mathletes¬†working on content 2-3 grade levels above their level in school, but all students¬†were gaining confidence and being exposed to new topics before learning them¬†in class. In one school, teachers saw ‚Äúunheard of‚Äù increases in MATHletes‚Äô standardized testing scores after just 3 intensive months on Khan Academy.¬†Schools have been transformed, and in future years, we see this generation of¬†MATHletes leading Ireland into its digital future. With a small team, and 4 months, the MATHletes Challenge experiment with¬†Khan Academy has captured the imagination of Ireland. As we work to make¬†next years‚Äô Challenge better, we encourage any group of parents, teachers, or¬†students to try a Challenge in your own community! Its amazing what a world¬†class training tool and a little competitive spirit can do to ignite a passion for¬†math.

The young Bulgarian graduated in philosophy and social studies in Leipzig, Germany. However, he has decided to returned to Bulgaria, because in his view, one can do a lot more in this country, as compared to the land of Goethe. He has the ambition to make a career in the philosophy and education field. That is why he will be working as a teacher for ‚ÄúTogether in Class‚Äù next school year. He does not know where he will teach German and philosophy, but he personally prefers to be sent to a small Bulgarian town. ‚ÄúI would be able to contribute a lot more if I worked in a small place‚Äù, explains Ivan . ‚ÄúOne of the program‚Äôs goals is to provide access to high-quality education to places with a deficit of such. Thus, I would be able to help children of whom people have low expectations. Their relatives can not imagine how these children can develop in spheres and professions which are not typical of their small town. I could not imagine it either. When I left for Germany to study philosophy I found it hard to explain to my relatives in the town of Haskovo (Southeastern Bulgaria) why I chose to study this subject. On the other hand, I would like to seclude myself in a small and peaceful place for some time.‚Äù For the past three years or so Ivan has been the Bulgarian Volunteer Advocate of the Khan Academy which is the biggest digital education project worldwide. Ivan‚Äôs goal is to translate this project into Bulgarian, so it is accessible to Bulgarian students. Some 350 volunteers have joined so far. These are mainly young people interested in modern technologies, or parents who want to guarantee a better future for their children. The website has already been launched in Spanish and Portuguese, with French and Turkish soon on the way. Ivan hopes that Bulgarian will be next up. Khan Academy is a free learning platform that includes video lectures and practice problems in mathematics and science, preparatory courses for university education. Lessons prepared in partnership with NASA were uploaded on the website as well. ‚ÄúWe can do things from a distance now, as we live in the Internet era. Khan Academy is one such project which can provide high-quality education through the Internet to places with no teachers‚Äù , explains Ivan. ‚ÄúIt is the biggest education web site worldwide. It contains over 6,500 video lessons and 100,000 exercises to these lessons, as well as educational software for class management. The good thing is that this software makes education in line with the students‚Äô profile. The exercises at the Khan Academy are generated especially for you based on your personal history, on how well you managed to solve the tasks and your gaps. We deal with this project, because it is currently the best model which enables the use of new technologies in education. Meanwhile, it is completely free of charge and is very useful to small places and institutions with a deficit of high-quality education such as prisons and orphanages for example.‚Äù The web site is applicable to all types of computers and mobile devices. It allows students, teachers and parents to create a profile. Specially-designed software enables teachers to have access to all necessary information about their class and their students. The main goal of the education platform is to assist the traditional education, rather than replacing it. ‚ÄúIt would be useful to many teachers who teach at a different pace, because the knowledge of the students is at a different level‚Äù, Ivan specifies. Khan Academy also enables students to combine their personal work done through video lectures and exercises with various activities, including developing social skills like working in a team.

In a live radio interview, Alp spoke about education reform and Khan Academy‚Äôs role, and shared Khan Academy‚Äôs story, what KA provides to students and teachers; as well as why Khan Academy is different. Half an hour on national radio was an important opportunity to reach new audiences in cities and in rural areas. ¬†Those stuck in busy city traffic heard Alp‚Äôs talk as they made their way through cities. ¬†Plus, national radio has traditionally been the mainstream information source for the many living in rural Turkey, an audience rarely reached through social media. Alp K√∂ksal at the Radio Station TRT Radyo 1 The interview is available in Turkish . About Khan Academy‚Äôs efforts in Turkey There is a very active group supported by STFA in Turkey working to bring free education to the country. ¬†Already, they have translated over 2500 KA videos into Turkish and delivered over 1.5 million lessons in a short time. Translations of the exercises and the full platform are almost finished and expected to be available this summer. In addition to a small team of dedicated full time personnel, a group of part time supporters and more than 250 voluntary translators have contributed to Khan Academy T√ºrk√ße so far. Khan Academy T√ºrk√ße has a motto: ‚ÄúEqual opportunities for all in Turkish education‚Äù. The Turkish Khan Academy videos are planned to be used in the nationwide massive education reform project in Turkey run by the Turkish state, which aims to hand out tablet computers to each and every student in the country. Khan Academy T√ºrk√ße has already become an important actor in Turkish education reform. Khan Academy T√ºrk√ße is an active participant in education events throughout Turkey and is working on five solid pilot schools implementations that use Khan Academy. About Alp Koksal: Having studied in Turkey and the United States at high-school and undergraduate levels, Alp has a global and multicultural perspective on education. With a BA in management and MA in European Studies, Alp has worked as a doctoral level researcher at the prestigious Boƒüazi√ßi University and he is currently a PhD candidate in Political Science and International Relations there. Alp says ¬†‚ÄúAs a good observer and researcher, I have brought my interest in multicultural education, non-profit work and academic background together when I joined the STFA Group as the director of Khan Academy T√ºrk√ße.‚Äú Alp manages the effort of translating, localizing and introducing Khan Academy to Turkey and the Turkish speakers in the world.¬†¬†As director of the Turkish team, he is also an active speaker on Khan Academy and the efforts in Turkey.", "date": "2014-06-20"},

Beth spent months on end in the circular, domed reading room of the British Library which was then in the center of the Museum, while writing her Masters thesis, taking her breaks in the galleries to get inspired.

A good quality basic education equips students with the foundational skills (reading, writing and numeracy) they need to function in today‚Äôs society and prepare them for lifelong learning. But in many parts of the world, schooling alone is not yielding the expected results, and countries are experimenting with innovative learning and teaching tools, including online platforms. In Brazil, a Portuguese version of the Khan Academy‚Äôs free online education platform (see World Bank Group President Jim Kim‚Äôs post last week ) is helping thousands of students master basic skills. This effort has been spearheaded by the Funda√ß√£o Lemann (Lemann Foundation), an organization dedicated to improving the country‚Äôs education quality. As with the original Khan Academy content, a student using the Brazil platform takes a quick test, maps her knowledge, and then masters the content at her own pace. Teachers can see a dashboard, which tells them how students are progressing. This helps decide homework, which is then graded by the system by the next day. They can even replay a video of the student solving the exercise. So teachers can dig in very deep if they wish, which helps them assign students to learning groups more efficiently and to encourage students to master the content during school hours. The foundation has now made Khan Academy content accessible to 70,000 students, 2,500 teachers, and several hundred schools in Brazil. An eight-hour training program has also been developed for teachers and focuses on areas they could improve on once they have the data from the platform.

So teachers can dig in very deep if they wish, which helps them assign students to learning groups more efficiently and to encourage students to master the content during school hours. The foundation has now made Khan Academy content accessible to 70,000 students, 2,500 teachers, and several hundred schools in Brazil. An eight-hour training program has also been developed for teachers and focuses on areas they could improve on once they have the data from the platform. Helping teachers with critical information about their students is at the heart of the program. ‚Ä¶. As the debate about technology in education continues, and points of view diverge, it is important not to impose approaches on schools unless they want it and perceive it as useful. In Brazil, districts have the freedom to choose whether or not they want to participate and use these online platforms. The Brazilian government provides the necessary infrastructure to any district that wishes to use the content. While the impact of the Brazilian platforms must be evaluated rigorously over time, early findings are encouraging. ¬†Data show that students using the platforms are more likely to show up in class. The platforms also help improve students‚Äô self-esteem. Nearly all teachers have consistently used the platform during the school year. These results hold promise and show that this is clearly a space to watch going forward!", "date": "2014-09-18"},

Here‚Äôs what he had to say! Tell us a little bit about the story of how the German translation effort got started. The German Translation effort was started in 2012 by a few dedicated contributors who mainly produced videos for the YouTube channel in the beginning. In the beginning everybody was mainly working on the topics where they had their own interests. What were the biggest trials and tribulations along the way? What problems are specific to the German language? Being a loose community who finds itself over the internet, we need to form a team with a common goal. This takes time and communication to reach agreements and people have to prioritize the common goal over their particular interests. Especially tricky is to make everybody use the same terminology as the many passerby contributors do not necessarily read our Vademecum [handbook] first. The German language distinguishes between polite (Sie) and colloquial (Du) for the english ‚Äòyou‚Äô. As a community we have taken the decision to use the colloquial ‚Äòdu‚Äô. But still many people submit translations with the more formal ‚ÄòSie‚Äô. Tell us what you think are the biggest strengths of your team. We are a very diverse Team living scattered over the whole globe. This brings experience from many different backgrounds together and we can literally work 24 hours. But the strongest point is, that everybody can subordinate their own interest to the major goal to complete first Basic and High School Maths to have this small portion of KA complete. What is your advice for language communities that are hoping to have a test site one day? Focus your efforts from the very first day so everybody translates/works on the same topics. When you complete one subject e.g. Early-Math celebrate in whatever form. Then move to the next subject. Write and maintain a common glossary of the translation terms, and advertise its usage especially to every new contributor joining your team. What are your goals for the future? Our dream is to become a Live Site Language working as professionally as the Brazilian, Spanish, French or Turkish Team and also organize events like the Bay Area Learnstorm. Our community is now growing and already became tax-exempted NGO, the structure needed to one day, hopefully, achieve this target.", "date": "2015-10-13"},

Tell us how you discovered Khan Academy as a platform, and then how you started¬†to help with the translation into Bulgarian? Hello all! Well, it was about two years ago when I started working as a professional translator and I was very eager to discover different projects to work on so I can enhance my skills. I accidentally came across Khan Academy ‚Äì Bulgaria project via Facebook and instantly thought ‚ÄòWhat a great idea, I love it!‚Äô. I reached out to the team and that‚Äôs how I got on board. Why does Bulgaria need Khan Academy? Frankly, education in Bulgaria has seen better days and students sometimes get lost in all the things they are expected to know. Sometimes they really need a gentle push and some help to reveal their true potential. That‚Äôs where Khan Academy steps in. Is there anything special or specific that people in other countries, especially beyond Europe, would not normally know about the Bulgarian language? I‚Äôve heard many people say that Bulgarian is an incredibly complicated language and very hard to learn‚Ä¶ Besides that, our verbs have gender categories and we have to bear in mind whether we‚Äôre talking about he, she or it and conjugate the verb accordingly. We also have different forms of polite address (–í–∏–µ) and of casual address (—Ç–∏), something that in English is only expressed by ‚Äúyou‚Äù. Why do you think you will (soon) be successful in bringing free world-class online education to Bulgarian kids? The Bulgarian team is not very big, but the job we do is really enormous. People are very dedicated, and they work hard for what they believe will be useful to boost our education system. We also have teachers working with us who are willing to check our translations so that there is no misinformation. Tell us your dream ‚Äì how do you imagine the education of the future? Orientated towards the individual. Children have special needs, they are emotional and very creative. Education shouldn‚Äôt be batch production aiming at quantity but at quality. Classes and education as a whole should be organized in such a manner so that everyone has the opportunity to get the most of it. There should be a lot more personal touch. Teachers shouldn‚Äôt just teach; they should ignite the spark of curiosity. Any advice for other translators? Keep up the great job you are doing by creating and translating Khan Academy content!

For example, an English math problem about a game of baseball may turn into a problem about a game of soccer in Portuguese or cricket in Hindi. A major focus of the convention was the 2019 goal of creating fully localized curricula for many countries. Just as students and teachers in the United States can currently find AP courses on Khan Academy, students and teachers in other countries will be able to find courses that are aligned to their own national curricula.

A note from the Kannada team Khan Academy is now available in Kannada. Kannada is spoken by 45 million people in the southern state of India called Karnataka . 4.8 million students write their board exams in Kannada across 10,300 schools. Our Kannada site hopes to bring Khan content to all these students; as of July 2019 Maths is available from Class 5 through 10 for these students. Perhaps in a first of its kind, the localization was carried out by teachers in the government schools of Karnataka. Two video creators and nearly a hundred text translators across 5 districts helped localize 2,300 videos and 1.3 million words. It took them just seven months to complete this. The immediate next step is to localize more Math content before beginning localization of Science content.

My name is Kami, and I‚Äôm a math content team member here at Khan Academy. I‚Äôm so excited to announce on behalf of the math team that our second-grade course is newly updated!. As a former elementary school teacher, I still remember searching for a free, go-to source to help my students learn and practice all the content that‚Äôs packed into the standards. Well, this new course on Khan Academy is just that‚Äîa comprehensive online resource for all things second-grade math. The new and improved second-grade course provides learners with a smooth progression through the Common Core Math Standards. We‚Äôve added more than 20 new exercises to the course to allow greater depth and breadth of learning. We also created new videos that engage the user in a quick and fun way. Engaging content: Our team worked hard to create items that use visuals, such as number lines, tape diagrams, base ten blocks, and ten frames to make our content more colorful and fun. We also found ways to incorporate whimsy and even some characters you may know (like Elsa and Olaf) in our content. Learning math may be challenging, but we also want to ensure that it‚Äôs FUN! Aligned instruction: We meticulously researched the standards to ensure that each one is being appropriately addressed and assessed. As we built the course, we continuously considered the three CCSS shifts of focus, coherence, and rigor. Both the practice content and the instructional content are aligned to the CCSS. Conceptual understanding: As a former elementary teacher, I still remember trying to encourage students to conceptually understand the content instead of memorizing it. We worked hard to put a focus on conceptual understanding throughout the course. We included scaffolded exercises, digital interactive tools, and visuals that will help solidify the conceptual piece of different standards. Hints, hints, hints: When I was in the classroom, I remember feeling the frustration of trying to help students who were stuck during their practice and not being able to help every student at the same time. It seemed like I needed to clone myself to allow each student to get the individual support they needed to progress through the content. Enter hints! Every single practice question consists of custom hints that tackle misconceptions and make sure students understand the process to work through each individual problem. The hints are crafted to allow¬† a productive struggle for students by scaffolding the solution in a way that makes sense and is age appropriate. We‚Äôre extremely proud of the work we‚Äôve done to totally revamp our second-grade course. We hope you love it as much as we do!", "date": "2020-07-30"},

My name is Charlotte, and I‚Äôm part of the US mathematics content team at Khan Academy. When I was using Khan Academy with my own high school geometry students, I loved many aspects of the course, but there were parts where my students and I wished we could dig deeper. My students loved how Khan Academy let them show what they knew in a few problems and showed just how to solve the questions where they were still learning. However, they had to look elsewhere for practice in key geometry skills like writing proofs. So, I‚Äôm thrilled to announce that we‚Äôve updated our high school geometry course for this school year! Here are some of the ways we‚Äôre bringing the concepts of reasoning and justification‚Äîwhich in geometry means explaining why you are sure something is true‚Äîto the forefront and tightening our focus so students have just the right amount of support and challenge. Timely, targeted support : Every unit begins with an article titled ‚ÄúGetting ready‚Äù that reviews key prerequisite skills from earlier courses. The embedded practice in the article offers students a low-stakes and lightweight way to gauge their own readiness for the unit with links for more practice as needed. Each article empowers students to identify and revisit unfinished learning and explains how the earlier skills tie into the unit‚Äôs grade-level content. Proofs and justification : Throughout the course, we will complete and evaluate proofs and informal justifications. Beyond selecting proof steps and explaining why they are valid, we will also determine intermediate goals for a proof, translate between symbolic statements and what they mean verbally about figures, and identify errors in sample work. Conceptual depth : Geometry is about so much more than a list of formulas. We‚Äôll explore how the building blocks of volume extend to more nuanced forms. We‚Äôll also grapple with the relationships between angle measures and lengths, learning how one can give us clues about the other. And we‚Äôll use the Pythagorean theorem and slope to relate visual representations of figures with their algebraic representations. Visual sense-making: Are those lines definitely parallel, or could they intersect? Will the figure help us prove a property for all parallelograms or just for this particular one? We‚Äôll sort out what‚Äôs true from what‚Äôs possible in diagrams and geometric constructions. We hope that as students reason, explain, and draw their way through high school geometry, they will recognize themselves as a mathematician with their own ideas to share.

We loved seeing the crazy ways that students used the platform, to create everything from hypnotic animations to addictive games . But we decided it was time to give students the option for a more structured approach to learning programming, and we embarked to ‚Äútutorial‚Äù-ize the CS curriculum. Thanks to our super summer interns Leif and Sophia, we launched the new interface for CS this week. This is our programming tutorial , what we recommend every learner start with: Right now, the tutorials are a mix of videos and coding ‚Äútalk-throughs‚Äù, where you can watch us code on the left and see the result on the right. But we don‚Äôt want students just passively watching, we want them practicing what they learn in the videos! So we‚Äôre building out a whole new challenge framework based on StructuredJS , where we‚Äôll be able to provide step-by-step instructions, example code with placeholders, and suggestions.

Alice was developed to teach programming in a novice-friendly way, using a highly visual drag-and-drop editor to create a 3d story or game. The Alice project was a great experiment in more learnable programming, and much has been published about it since, like in this paper from Cooper . One of the findings was that Alice appealed to a wide audience, across cultures and genders, because story telling appeals to everyone ‚Äì people just tell different stories and create different worlds! They also found that many students would rely *too much* on trial and error to figure out a solution, and they started emphasizing design and storyboarding more to prevent that. We showed Stephen what we‚Äôre currently working on with our tutorials and challenges, and he had some great feedback that we‚Äôll incorporate. There‚Äôs one crucial thing he says that everyone loved in Alice, and that we‚Äôre missing entirely: Penguins. Apparently, penguins are a universal truth.

We‚Äôd like to use them as a starting point to spark a conversation with the teaching community. It‚Äôs our first iteration, and we‚Äôre under no illusion that we‚Äôve figured it all out. We know that teaching is complicated and difficult, and we‚Äôre still trying to live up to our own guidelines given the time and tool limitations. While we have to strike a balance between covering material, developing strong content, and enhancing the platform, we always like to discuss what we could do better. So, we would love to hear reactions to these design guidelines based your experiences teaching kids programming. How can we better fulfill these guidelines? How can we support more effective learning within the talkthrough format? What are the tips and tricks you‚Äôve picked up from your teaching or research? Please write a comment, or get in touch with us at compsci-feedback@khanacademy.org. What is a Talkthrough? A ‚Äútalkthrough‚Äù is how we deliver online programming lessons on Khan Academy. You can check out the current talkthroughs in the Khan Academy Programming tutorial . Most recently, last week I created Text Part One , Text Part Two , and our Intro Sneak Peek , and Pamela created Variable Expressions . The rest were created by Jessica Liu last summer. As background, a talkthrough tries to mimic the experience of sitting down next to someone and sharing a computer. In essence, the teacher records audio while typing code and drawing in our live execution environment. During playback, the student sees the code changing, and they can pause at any point to experiment with the code. The student can also create a ‚Äúspinoff‚Äù to make changes and save the program as their own.

As he discusses, the goal of the platform at this point is not to make software engineers or teach AP Computer Science, but rather ‚Äúto get people (especially kids) excited about programming.‚Äù Design Guidelines for Teaching Pass the Interesting Test What would your middle-school cousin think if they saw this example? Do you have a compelling example, or is it contrived? Focus on a program you could actually envision kids wanting to spinoff and customize. Also, it‚Äôs great to show off how programming connects to all kinds of different interests, not just ‚ÄúCS things.‚Äù Self-expression also seems to be a big draw. Concretely: Penguins and monsters are interesting! Adding numbers for the sake of adding numbers not so much. Winston, a simple face, was a big hit from last summer due to his appearance in Intro to Variables ‚Äî just look at the spinoffs to see the excitement and creativity. Prove what you‚Äôre saying, live But how do we know that the ellipse is positioned based on its center? How do we know that the default text color is white? How do we know that this rectangle controls that leg? Use the live coding environment to demonstrate that what you‚Äôre saying actually is true. Don‚Äôt require the listener to take it on faith if possible. Put the ellipse at (0, 0) to show what happens. Set the background to red so that the white text is visible. Comment out that rect and see the leg disappear. As you explain, prove it with a demonstration. It is way easier to watch something relevant happen as you explain than just to stare at a static screen while you talk. The visual also helps the concept feel real. Concretely: In the middle of the Text Tutorial , I say that the x and y coordinates for text specify the lower-left coordinate. I prove that is true by setting y = height (the text sits on the bottom). Then I try y = 0 (the text disappears) and show how the text starts peeking out from the top as I increase y, asking the listener if this is what they would expect. Make beginner mistakes Seeing when things break can help students better grasp the material, especially when it is unexpected. Plus, it can get boring if you are always writing perfect code. So, throw in a few (well-chosen) mistakes which you then clearly explain and fix. It can help challenge the student to figure out what is going wrong on their own, and it better prepares them for writing their own programs. In particular, rather than mentioning possible errors that you could be making but aren‚Äôt, go ahead and make those errors. Access your array out of bounds. Don‚Äôt declare a variable. Your students won‚Äôt be writing perfect programs, so show them what is easy to mess up, what goes wrong, and how to recover. While doing this, keep an eye on pacing and flow so that the mistakes don‚Äôt feel jarring. Concretely: In Intro to Animation , Jessica does a great job making mistakes midway through as she tries to animate the car moving. Rather than just presenting ‚ÄúHere is how you animate,‚Äù her first attempt just changes x from 10 to 11. Of course, the car goes to 11 but still doesn‚Äôt animate, and we need to figure out what is wrong. She also ‚Äúforgets‚Äù to set the background, causing the car to smear across the screen. Connect to previous lessons Explicitly point back to previous lessons when you use an idea that‚Äôs already been covered, or to draw a similarity ‚Äî ‚ÄúWe already know how to draw rectangles and circles. But what if we wanted to draw more complicated shapes?‚Äù Not only does this help the student feel ‚ÄúI have learned something!‚Äù it gives a strong sense of progress. It can also be a quick refresher. Concretely: This one is pretty easy ‚Äî for example, at the start of Mouse Interaction , Jessica points back at regular variables to point forward to mouseX and mouseY, special mouse variables. Or, toward the end of Text Part Two , I point out how we‚Äôve already seen animation ‚Äî we need a variable, and we also need to be changing the variable to get animation, and we‚Äôre just doing that with text instead of shapes now. Build strong mental models How do you communicating the essence of the topic? Does it give the new programmer a good intuition? When they make sense, simple analogies to real life or quick drawings can build helpful mental models for how things are working. A strong mental model helps the student make predictions about how the concept will behave beyond the examples you show. It creates the feeling, ‚ÄúI understand how this works!‚Äù Concretely: About a third of the way through Intro to Coloring , Jessica explains the fill command with a ‚Äúcolor butler‚Äù who is in charge of colors. He can only hold one colored marker in his left hand and one bucket of paint in his right hand. Stroke changes the color of the marker, and fill changes the color of the paint. She even includes a drawing. This is exactly the intuition a programmer needs to understand the state-driven coloring (instead of object-specific coloring), and it is presented in a fun and memorable way. Weave together explanations and code, avoiding repetition Don‚Äôt try to explain everything in advance. Provide a brief explanation or motivation, then write some code, and then deepen the explanation, then code some more. It can be hard for a student to understand why something matters until they see it happen. Do your best to spiral back and hit the same concept in different ways at different times, pushing the student‚Äôs understanding. Concretely: In Text Part Two , I cover using strings with variables. Rather than explain in advance every detail of using a variable, what it will be good for, and adding together string variables, I begin by just asking, ‚ÄúCould we use variables with strings?‚Äù and then refactor the code to show that yes, indeed we can, and it works as expected. Then I address, ‚ÄúThis looks exactly the same. What was the point of adding the variable?‚Äù I add to the code to show that now, if we‚Äôre using the variable to write our name three times, we can just change that one variable to write a different name. Then I point out, ‚ÄúWell, we added together variables when they were numbers ‚Äî could we add together variables with strings?‚Äù and continue on in this fashion, interleaving the explanations and the code demonstrations. Reduce mental overhead The more extra concepts involved in your example, the larger the mental overhead for a student seeing something new for the first time. Not only do they have to grasp how this crazy new thing works, but they also need to figure out everything else going on. So, try to keep your code as simple as possible when you introduce a new idea. An easy test is to show an experienced programmer your example code ‚Äî ask if they think that the main idea is clear and obvious just from the code, without even showing them the audio. Then, after you teach the basics of a concept, go ahead and demonstrate how it interacts with concepts already covered. Concretely: In the text tutorials, Part One introduces the concept by building up from a single call to text, while Part Two shows how text can interact with variables, animation, and mouse interaction. If I had tried to explain the basics of text starting from the final mouse-following, animated name program in part two, I would have muddied the introduction with a bunch of unnecessary overhead. Cushion tricky concepts If this is a tricky concept, reassure the student that it is okay to be a little confused at the start. Try to build up based on what they already know. It can be useful to explain that the concept is not a brand new idea, but rather something they already have seen outside of code ‚Äî we‚Äôre just using a different language now. You might discuss, ‚ÄúWhat in real life is like an array?‚Äù Learning to program can be scary, so try to help out. Concretely: In Variable Expressions , Pamela uses a real-life example to make variable dependencies more approachable. She talks about how in real life our body parts grow together over time, and how we just want to use code to do something similar with the penguin. Stay short Go for bite-sized. We‚Äôre fighting short attention spans, and research on boredom ( Slide 19 from one of Pamela‚Äôs presentations, for example) suggests that it is easy to start getting bored after 10 minutes. To a beginner, mistakes like rambling explanations and verbal stumbles can be really confusing and distracting. Go through your talkthrough and replace any long, wordy segments with snappier explanations. On a related note, try not to get bogged down making repetitive changes ‚Äî either simplify the code (by far the best option), copy-and-paste the end result once the student gets the point, or tell really really good jokes. Concretely: All our talkies try to stay under 7 minutes, and ideally shorter. To balance, we‚Äôll split up topics into parts ‚Äî Intro to Variables, More on Variables, for example. We‚Äôre also working on some other changes that should help engage users. Amp up the energy! Treat your talkthrough as entertainment. Do ridiculous (on-topic) things with code to keep it fun. Be a little silly. Your students are gracing you with their presence! Give them a reason to stay. (This can be hard when recording for the 12th time in a dark room.) Concretely: The start of Pamela‚Äôs Variable Expressions has some fantastic moments with penguin hippy-hop and penguin shuffle to show off the dependence on the two position variables. She also makes the penguin head float far above the body, then puts it back ‚Äúbecause he‚Äôs cuter that way.‚Äù She makes us want to see what the penguin does next, and it is way more engaging than if she had just said, ‚ÄúThese variables control the placement of the shapes.‚Äù Avoid jargon Only use a term if it is necessary. If you do use it, be sure to introduce it and explain it ‚Äî don‚Äôt just drop it in. Also try to make your introduction a little fun (decomposition? like rotting plants? ew!). It can be easy to use jargon without realizing it, so keep an ear out. Concretely: At the start of Text Part Two , I introduce the word ‚Äústring.‚Äù The debate went back and forth, but our team decided that it was important to familiarize students with the term. Still, I only introduce it in Part Two, after the student has learned the basics of text. I explain it as a fancy programmer term for something they already know about ‚Äî I also throw in that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what your cat plays with‚Äù because cats are cute, and because to a beginner, ‚Äústring‚Äù does at first mean a cotton strand. Directly encourage exploration Explicitly recommend that your student explore the program and engage with the code. Suggest moments when they should pause the recording and try something on their own, even if it as simple as changing a number or playing with an animation. Give the student a few clear next steps when the talkthrough ends. In our live coding environment, the student only has to press pause to transition between watching a talkthrough and coding on their own. Even so, we‚Äôve seen that beginners can be tremendously hesistant to change the code without direct permission or guidance. Special moments in the talkthroughs that suggest exactly what to try can help lower the intimidation factor, encouraging these students to dive in and overcome their fear of breaking things or making a mistake. Concretely: In the middle of the Sneak Peek Intro , I tell students to pause the program to see how the ellipse follows their mouse around. Or, at the end of Variable Expressions , Pamela recommends that students finish fixing the penguin‚Äôs feet on their own. During Text Part One , I use my name as an example and encourage the student to switch it out for their name. We throw in these next steps to help the student develop the attitude of jumping into programs and exploring how they work. Goals By the end of your talkthrough, the student should know: What is this new concept? How does it fit in with what I already have learned? Why are we even covering it? When would I ever want to use this new concept? In particular, what can I do now that I couldn‚Äôt do (or was very tedious to do) before? What is tricky when using this new concept? What are the common mistakes I‚Äôm going to make, and how can I discover and fix them? By the end of your talkthrough, the student should feel: That was sort of neat! I could start using this right away in some of my programs! I should make a spinoff to customize this! I understand everything going on in this code, and I feel confident I could explain it to someone else! (ideally) Note: As a prerequisite, of course, the student needs to get to the end of the talkthrough in the first place ‚Äî expect another post soon on the metrics we are using to quantitatively evaluate talkthroughs and attrition! Feedback from the Teaching Community? We would love to hear suggestions and feedback from the teaching community based on your experiences engaging kids in programming. Again, we are still far from where we want to be even in fulfilling these guidelines, but we welcome your feedback. We would appreciate your reactions and suggestions from insights into how kids learn coding to tips on their favorite examples. We want to make this the best platform possible for getting kids creating with code ‚Äî it is a work in progress, and we‚Äôre excited to be ramping up.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Launch: Introducing Programming Challenges", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/launch-introducing-programming-challenges/", "abstract": "‚Äì Sophia Westwood, Khan Academy CS software engineering Today we‚Äôre launching programming challenges, a major new part of Khan Academy Computer Science! We have been working on designing and building the challenge platform over the last few months, and we‚Äôre excited to introduce you to our first iteration. Go ahead and try your hand at a challenge ‚Äî good luck! We envision the challenges as a core component of our curriculum alongside the talkthroughs . While the talkthroughs involve mostly passive learning (similar to watching a video), the challenges emphasize active, participatory learning. Why challenges? At the start of the summer, our team discussed where we wanted to take Khan Academy Computer Science over the next few months. We agreed that students would learn best (and have more fun!) by actually coding, and we wanted more students to experience the thrill of creating something neat with code. But, for a beginner programmer, there is an enormous gap between watching the talkthroughs on drawing or animation, and actually drawing or animating something on your own. We didn‚Äôt have anything to bridge the gap between guided, passive lessons and open-ended program creation. So, we started tossing around the idea of coding challenges. The challenges would provide guidance and help students start coding and creating right away. Rather than just listening to talkthroughs, the students would have to figure things out and apply what what they just learned. And, after completing the challenge, they would have a program that they could continue to extend and customize. The challenges are in essence bite-size versions of offline programming assignments that include live feedback, hints, and steps. They form a structured environment for students to gain experience with new concepts by actually coding and creating, allowing for exploration while also providing guidance on program correctness. What is a challenge? After a student watches a talkthrough, we encourage them to start a challenge to begin coding with the concept they just learned. A challenge is a series of steps that the student must complete to create a program. The steps break down the program, providing guidance to the student on how to approach each part. We check whether the student has completed each step, providing hints when the student goes astray. Our challenges try to balance guidance and flexibility, centered around StructuredJS , the library we wrote to verify student code and give hints. Expect to hear more over the next few weeks about the design considerations and technical infrastructure behind the challenge framework! Credit reel Challenges have been a major feature for the Computer Science team over the last few months, particularly the two summer interns. Leif Foged took charge of the challenge user interface, tirelessly working towards a more intuitive and beautiful frontend while building out functionality. I worked on the challenge infrastructure, building StructuredJS as the core static analysis driving our challenge verification and hints, as well as the necessary backend for user progress.  Pamela Fox contributed creative and fun ideas for challenges, leading to crazy face , ice cream , and cloudy day . Designer Kitt Hirasaki helped us iterate all summer on the display, and after starting only four days prior, new hire Tabitha Yong designed the mock-ups for the interface that led to our final design. And of course, our team lead John Resig masterfully guided the process, from the initial meetings where we threw out the possibility of challenges, all through the launch today, with countless code reviews and design conversations along the way. Although we‚Äôre just getting started, we‚Äôre excited to see the community response and learn from your feedback. We are also looking forward to extending the curriculum with new challenges and talkthroughs.", "date": "2013-08-30"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Teaching Variables: Analogies and Approaches", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/teaching-variables-analogies-and-approaches/", "abstract": "As we‚Äôre in the process of auditing and redoing our introductory talk-throughs , we find ourselves discussing the different approaches to teaching variables and debating which analogies make variables the most approachable to newbies. There are a few aspects of variables that we‚Äôd ideally like new learners to understand: A variable has both a ‚Äúname‚Äù and a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù. The value can change (atleast, in JavaScript). A variable can be used multiple times throughout the code. There are some aspects that maybe they don‚Äôt need to understand at first, but it‚Äôd be a nice bonus if they did: Variables can hold data of different sizes. Variables can be different types. Multiple variables can point at the same value (more true in the case of objects than primitives). We‚Äôve considered a few analogies ourselves, and I asked around to find out what other folks use. Here‚Äôs a round-up of them, with scribbles approximating how one might visualize them on a whiteboard. It‚Äôs not always necessary to be able to visualize an analogy, but it helps. ‚ÄúBuckets‚Äù We currently use this analogy in our first talk-through on variables. We don‚Äôt love it, however ‚Äì we don‚Äôt usually think of buckets as having labels in the real world, so this analogy doesn‚Äôt help reinforce the important idea of variables being labels for containers that hold values. ‚ÄúDrawers‚Äù/‚ÄùBoxes‚Äù We like this analogy because drawers are often labeled as to their contents, and the idea actually maps nicely to what happens behind the scenes in a computer too, with the registers.  Kevin Henney points out that the ‚Äúlabeled boxes‚Äù analogy also works nicely for introducing ‚Äúarrays (a row or column of boxes) and objects (a group of boxes).‚Äù Ikai Lan likes how ‚Äúbox size is a good analogy for type discussions later on.‚Äù ‚ÄúEnvelopes‚Äù Similar to drawers, envelopes often have something on the outside (a name or address) and a value on the inside (the letter). An envelope can also be different sizes, which lends itself nicely to talking about storing data types. But, the address doesn‚Äôt map perfectly to variable names, and I prefer using the envelopes analogy to explain concepts like HTTP requests or message sending systems. ‚ÄúTentacles‚Äù Marjin Haverbeke describes variables as tentacles in the first chapter of his great book, Eloquent JavaScript, and its a great analogy to emphasize the idea of variables as pointers: ‚ÄúYou should imagine variables as tentacles, rather than boxes. They do not contain values, they grasp them ‚Äï two variables can refer to the same value.‚Äù ‚ÄúName tags‚Äù / ‚ÄúNames‚Äù This analogy really emphasizes the named aspect of variables. Want to refer to something by name? Then slap a name tag on it! ‚ÄúCode like a Pythonista‚Äù uses this analogy extensively with diagrams demonstrating what happens when you re-assign a variable and assign two variables to the same value. They specifically stress that in Python, variables ‚Äúare not labeled boxes.‚Äù ‚ÄúValues in disguise‚Äù Math.com describes algebraic variables with interesting wording: ‚ÄúIn algebraic expressions, letters represent variables. These letters are actually numbers in disguise. In this expression, the variables are x and y. We call these letters ‚Äúvariables‚Äù because the numbers they represent can vary‚Äîthat is, we can substitute one or more numbers for the letters in the expression.‚Äù The notion of disguise is fun and playful, and it‚Äôs nice how they‚Äôve attempted to correlate the actual word ‚Äúvariable‚Äù to its meaning. We often forget in programming how weird some of our terminology is, and that it might help learners to connect the words to their meaning. Which should we use? Of all of those, we will likely be going with ‚Äúlabeled boxes‚Äù for future lessons, because it‚Äôs a familiar concept and the analogy covers many aspects of variables. We‚Äôll keep trying out approaches and seeing how students respond. In the meantime, we‚Äôd love to hear what your experience with teaching and learning variables. What worked? What made it click? What didn‚Äôt work?", "date": "2013-09-10"},

Back then, a ‚Äúcomputer camp‚Äù was a rare beast, but now, there are more and more of them popping up ‚Äì which is awesome, because it means that more kids get exposed to programming in a fun and friendly environment and have the opportunity to figure out whether they want to keep going with it. I thought I‚Äôd do a little research into what kid-friendly coding camps, clubs, and classes are available in the bay area, and share that here.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Disabling Copy/Paste == Increasing Learning?", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/disabling-copy-paste-increasing-learning/", "abstract": "In our coding challenges , we present a ‚Äúhint‚Äù for each steps, which is a bit of code with blanks, and it‚Äôs up to them to figure out where that code fits in the current program and what will go in the blanks. For example, here‚Äôs a hint from our very first challenge, which gets them to use the rect() command to form an H: The goal is for them to learn by doing ‚Äì to get a general idea of what we want code want them to produce, and to tinker until they figure it out. The hints vary in each challenge in how much they reveal, but there is always some structural hint to guide them. In reviewing the challenge feedback form (which automatically records the students‚Äô code when they report a problem), I noticed many students had clearly copy-pasted the hint code. I can tell that from tell-tale missing arguments, wherever a blank had been ‚Äì like \"rect(,70,60,50)\" . With invalid JavaScript like that, students would immediately see an ‚ÄúOh noes!‚Äù syntax error and have to work out what it meant. Oftentimes, those syntax errors are not particularly newbie-friendly (which is a problem for another day!) and that can really throw a student off. We had two possible solutions: Smart copy/paste : We could probably hack it so that when you pasted a blank, you‚Äôd get a comment instead, or we could change the editor to have a placeholder and disable syntax errors. We would still need to explain what comments were or what those placeholders were for. Disable copy/paste : If we disabled copy/paste, they would be forced to type it in, which would mean they would encounter our more sensible messages that remind them of the proper arguments for that function (instead of the more nonsensical confused syntax error). It also means they would have to take the challenge more slowly, and think about what it was they were typing. Though I can‚Äôt find any research in the programming space, there is research in the note-taking space that manually typing increases learning more than copy/pasting, due to the extra attention it requires. Well, we‚Äôre all about increasing learning here, so we went with the latter option, using the CSS user select property on the code. Yes, they could be savvy and inspect element to get that code, but it is highly unlikely that our beginning students will do that, and they are who we want to do the most learning. Now, we‚Äôre not against copy/paste everywhere ‚Äì once you understand code, you can be quite productive when you learn how to find the most similar code to what you want, and then copy-paste-and-modify. But that‚Äôs not the skill we‚Äôre testing in the challenges, and we think it‚Äôs worth it to make them go through the effort to type syntax that is only marginally familiar. If anyone has done research or your own experiments to study the effects of typing versus copy/pasting when learning code, we‚Äôd love to hear about it.", "date": "2013-09-28"},

AWESOME!!!!!  I love you guys. This is so fun, I probably won‚Äôt get any sleep tonight.‚Äù ‚Äì Dallas In just our first month, just over 14,000 students have completed a Khan Academy coding challenge ‚Äî nearly 56,000 challenge completions total! Overall, students completed 58% of the challenges they attempted, but over the last week, our completion rate jumped to 66% , likely thanks to improvements made based on user feedback. We started with just a couple of challenges, but have steadily been adding more to make sure we assess every part of programming that we teach ‚Äì like drawing , animation , and strings . We really want students like Dallas to enjoy these challenges and to learn from them, so we‚Äôre gathering user feedback and aggregating statistics.

It‚Äôs a simple challenge to use the text() command multiple times. ‚ÄúMickey Mouse Ears‚Äù is the challenge with the lowest completion rate (46%).

Since the launch, we‚Äôve added a lot of content to our programming curriculum , so most of it is new and un-translated. We would really love for Spanish speakers to be able to learn programming in their own language, and we‚Äôre hoping that some of you can help with the translation. We would especially love for developers to get involved with translations, since our curriculum is highly technical and not so easy to translate by a lay-person. How can you help? Well, we use crowdin.net to manage our translations, and anyone can sign up and contribute translations. The moderation team will review them, and if there are no issues with them, they‚Äôll be downloaded into our codebase nightly and uploaded on the next deploy. Here‚Äôs an overview of the parts of the programming curriculum that can be translated: Titles, descriptions : Like ‚ÄúIntro to loops‚Äù and ‚ÄúLearn how to use a loop to repeat code over and over.‚Äù Most of these are translated now. Challenge messages : In the coding challenges , each step is accompanied by a title and description. When a student doesn‚Äôt write correct code, there‚Äôs often a message that pops up and tries to guide them towards improving their code, like ‚ÄúHm, is your y value big enough?‚Äù. There are about 5-15 messages per step, and that‚Äôs the bulk of what is untranslated now. For translating those, it‚Äôs probably best to actually try the challenge out and see what the messages are talking about. If you‚Äôre a developer, you should have no problem completing the challenge (and if you do, let me know!). Syntax errors : Whenever a student writes code in our editor, we run JSHint over it and pop up a message to warn about syntax errors, like ‚ÄúUnclosed string!‚Äù. Based on feedback from the challenges, we‚Äôve been adding and improving those messages, so there are a few more of these that need translating. You can find the first two types of messages by visiting our crowdin.net project page and searching for ‚Äúlearn.cs‚Äù in the page. There‚Äôs also a lot of messages here . Crowdin shows the percentage translated, so you can tell at a glance which areas need the most help. There are a few parts of our curriculum that cannot yet be translated: Talk-throughs : These are our alternative to videos, with English audio narrating over live code editing. We need to add a dubbing or subtitle mechanism to them. ( Update on Nov. 27, 2013: We now have a transcript mechanism for them. ) Comments : Any single or multi-line comments in official programs, talk-throughs, and challenges. We try to keep them small and nouns-only when possible, for now, since we don‚Äôt yet have a translation mechanism for them. In the meantime, we would love your help in translating the hundreds of message strings that are on Crowdin now. We‚Äôd also love to hear where and how you are using Khan Academy with Spanish-speaking audiences. Muchas gracias!", "date": "2013-10-14"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "A more newbie-friendly documentation", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/a-more-newbie-friendly-documentation/", "abstract": "After giving a talk on developer experience last week, I was reminded of something that‚Äôs been bothering me about the Khan Academy developer experience: the documentation . Previously, our documentation was a one-pager with columns for ‚ÄúShapes‚Äù, ‚ÄúMouse‚Äù, and other categories. We auto-generated the documentation based on tagged programs, dynamically arranging the columns to balance them and alphabetizing the functions inside each column. It was handy that we auto-generated the docs, because we could add more to the docs without a code change, but it also had its drawbacks: The columns weren‚Äôt always in the same place, so you couldn‚Äôt memorize the spatial location of what you were looking for. Sometimes, the most ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù column would be at the top, showing functionality that newbies didn‚Äôt know yet, and making it harder for them to find what they are looking for. On a similar vein, inside each column, the more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù functions would be at the top, burying the more basic, far more commonly used functions (like arc and bezier appearing before rect and ellipse). Before: For our audience of mostly beginner programmers, it‚Äôs important that our documentation be newbie friendly. It should be very easy for them to find what they‚Äôre looking for, and to not get distracted by things they‚Äôre not looking for. Given those goals, we‚Äôve renovated our documentation in the following ways: The sections are now ordered in rough ‚Äúcurriculum-order‚Äù, the order in which students learn things if they go through the tutorials. The sections are now rows, not columns, so that the student can process a section before getting distracted by other sections on the side. Within a section, the functions are also in curriculum-order, instead of alphabetical. Given we only have ~9 functions per section, it seems better than alphabetical order. If we grow beyond that, we may reconsider. Now: At the bottom of the documentation, we used to have links for students to go off and learn programming in other places (including different languages). We now focus that section on links for students to specifically learn more about JavaScript and ProcessingJS, the subjects of the documentation.  We‚Äôve also added a section on the differences between the original ProcessingJS and the Khan Academy version, like disallowing the non-JS Java syntax and making the default angle mode be degrees instead of radians. If you are using us inside a classroom, you might also be interested in the ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù version of the documentation, which I made by simply stripping out all the interface around the documentation panel. You should certainly encourage your students to use the in-page docs, but there are some students that prefer having a paper cheat sheet to look at instead. We hope these changes will improve the developer experience for budding Khan Academy programmers!", "date": "2013-10-30"},

GirlsWhoCode is an amazing non-profit that wants to teach pre-college girls about computer science, via summer camps and school year clubs at high schools around the country. They also happen to use Khan Academy for teaching programming, so it‚Äôs a great opportunity for me to see Khan in the classroom with my own eyes. One of the important things that I want to share with our club students are the many social aspects of programming ‚Äì the whole spectrum of learning from each other online, helping each other in person, giving peer reviews, and the practice of pair programming. We could just tell them ‚Äúpick a pair and program‚Äù but I wanted them to really understand *how* to pair program and *why* its useful. I started with this short slideset on pair programming: Then, I did a little variables review and told the students what project they‚Äôd be working on, the Custom Clothing Project . They proceeded to pick a partner, re-arranging chairs when needed, and got to work. As I walked around, it looked like most pairs were pairing well, collaborating and switching off every so often. A few pairs devolved into working on their own computers, which is something that can easily happen when a classroom is lacking actual physical pairing stations. Next time, I may explicitly tell them to turn one computer off, or only host documentation on it. Overall, I‚Äôm happy we introduced pair programming this way, and hope to use it in our future in-class projects. If you‚Äôre thinking of introducing it to your classroom, I recommend checking out the NCWIT Pair-Programming-in-a-Box kit , which also has recommended surveys for finding out from students how well they liked it. If you‚Äôre a teacher that already uses pair programming, I‚Äôd love to hear your tips, especially for doing it at a younger age and with the Khan curriculum.", "date": "2013-11-14"},

At Khan Academy, we‚Äôre obviously pretty excited about this initiative, since we believe that all students should start learning computational thinking and programming at an early age, even if that‚Äôs not what they ultimately do in life. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not yet a part of the K-12 Common Core curriculum, so many teachers don‚Äôt get the chance to expose their students to programming. Thanks to the Hour of Code initiative, we hope they can find the time ‚Äì and that some students will keep going afterwards once they‚Äôve realized how cool programming can be. Our full programming curriculum takes much longer than an hour to complete, so we‚Äôve curated a subset of the first tutorial to come up with a special Hour of Code mini curriculum .

We lived in the boonies, and the nearest store was a two-hour walk away, past a high-security prison. Well, I could have done the ‚Äúdraw a card, it‚Äôs the thought that counts‚Äù route, but I‚Äôd already done that in forgetful years past, so I needed a new ‚Äúthought that counts‚Äù gift.

We love giving our learners a general direction and seeing the many different ways they take it and what they learn along the way.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Newbie Syntax Blindness", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/newbie-syntax-blindness/", "abstract": "For the very first step of the very first challenge that learners do in our programming curriculum, they are given one instruction: type a piece of code exactly as it‚Äôs displayed. The displayed code is pretty simple, a single command: rect(80, 70, 60, 240); ‚Ä¶well, it‚Äôs simple to those of us who know programming. But for somebody who‚Äôs never programmed before, it‚Äôs not necessarily that simple. It‚Äôs a mix of letters and symbols combined in a way that‚Äôs completely new to them, and even when the goal is just to copy the line exactly, it‚Äôs easy to get confused. A newbie does not realize what‚Äôs important about the syntax of a programming language ‚Äì they don‚Äôt realize that capitalization matters, they don‚Äôt know that a misplaced comma can be a fatal error, they don‚Äôt distinguish between different types of brackets. That‚Äôs probably because they‚Äôre coming from human languages, where much of that doesn‚Äôt matter, and they haven‚Äôt re-trained their brain to realize what matters in a programming language. To give you a concrete idea of what I‚Äôm talking about, here are specific examples of syntax errors that new programmers make with that single line of code: (10, 70, 60, 240)           // Not starting with function name rect{80, 70, 60, 240};      // Using {} instead of () rect[80, 70, 60, 240];      // Using [] instead of () rect( 80 , 70 , 60 , 240 ), // Using comma instead of semi-colon rect(140, 170,120, 140, )   // Extra comma rect()70,60,240);           // Extra close paren rect;(140, 170, 260, 484);  // Mis-placed semi-colon Now, we send all user code through JSHint , so they will see an error message pop up when they make a mistake like this. But for many users making these sort of errors, that error message wasn‚Äôt enough to help them figure out the error, and they clicked our ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù button to report their confusion. For each of these mistakes, I put them in the editor myself, saw the error that popped up from JSHint, and thought to myself, ‚ÄúIs that what *I* would tell a learner if I saw them make that mistake in person?‚Äù For many of them, the answer was no. I would give them a much more specific, helpful message. That‚Äôs not because JSHint is bad ‚Äì it‚Äôs fantastic ‚Äì but because I know exactly what their end goal is, I can offer a more informed message than JSHint. JSHint has to offer messages for all possible JS that someone could write, and can‚Äôt assume it knows anything about their intentions. There are many ambiguous errors that one can make in JS, and the JSHint messages have to equal the ambiguity of those errors. We can‚Äôt be emailing every learner that encounters one of these syntax errors with our hand-curated custom messages, as we now have thousands of students going through these challenges every day ‚Äî that just wouldn‚Äôt scale! So we‚Äôve added another set of messages that override JSHint syntax messages, are specific to a challenge, and are served based on matching a RegEx of the code. These messages provide more meaningful, newbie-friendly syntax help, and will hopefully help learners get over the beginner syntax hump. Here‚Äôs a before/after of our messages: Their code Old message New message (10, 70, 60, 240) I thought you were going to type an assignment or function call but you typed an expression instead. Make sure you specify the command name, rect, before the parenthesis. rect{80, 70, 60, 240}; I thought you were going to type an assignment or function call but you typed an expression instead. Make sure you use parenthesis around the numbers, *not* curly brackets. rect[80, 70, 60, 240]; I thought you were going to type ] to match [ from line 2 but you typed , Make sure you use parenthesis around the numbers, *not* square brackets. rect( 80 , 70 , 60 , 240 ), Unexpected early end of program. Make sure you end your statement with a *semi-colon*, not a comma. rect(140, 170,120, 140, ) I think you either have an extra comma or a missing argument? You have an extra comma after your last parameter. rect()70,60,240); It looks like you have an extra ) There‚Äôs an extra parenthesis before the first parameter of the rect() command. rect;(140, 170, 260, 484); I thought you were going to type an assignment or function call but you typed an expression instead. You have an unnecessary semi-colon after the command name. We won‚Äôt be able to hand-curate every syntax error they encounter, but we hope that helping them through the first challenge will give them the confidence to approach and interpret the more ambiguous errors they‚Äôll encounter late in their programming life. A big take-away for us, as teachers: never assume anything is obvious. Just because it‚Äôs obvious to us what the difference is between the written code and the displayed code, does in no way mean it will be obvious to new programmers.", "date": "2013-12-12"},

Here‚Äôs a round-up of the major improvements that we‚Äôve made based on the feedback from our fantastic community of learners and teachers: We documented everything. We previously linked to the ProcessingJS reference for the less commonly used functions, but that is a confusing reference for Khan Academy programmers due to their use of Java syntax and references to renderers that we don‚Äôt support. We went through the entire ProcessingJS reference to find everything that we do support but hadn‚Äôt documented yet, and added them to our docs. That meant adding a few new sections entirely (like Transforms and Time & Date ) and adding a ‚ÄúSee also‚Äù to existing sections. If we‚Äôre missing something still, please let us know. Our goal is that you should be able to learn about everything we support from ProcessingJS from our own documentation. We added visuals. We get many questions from new programmers about how to draw particular shapes. To help them figure that out faster, we‚Äôve added screenshots to the ‚ÄúShapes‚Äù section and the new ‚ÄúComplex Shapes‚Äù section. Now they can look at a glance to see what shape looks the most like what they have in their head, without having to know already what a ‚Äúbezier‚Äù curve is. We introduced a consistent format. Now, for everything we document, we follow the same structure: a description followed by a table of parameters and parameter descriptions. This is based on the ProcessingJS reference, but is also based on documentation that learners will find when using many programming languages and libraries. We hope that the more consistent format will help them learn how to use our documentation better, and also to use others‚Äô documentation. We improved the linkability. We made the links on the documentation look more like links, and we also added in-page anchors with a ‚ÄúQuick jump‚Äù at the top of the page. We made it translatable. Previously, we documented functions and parameters inside the comments of the demo programs, but since we don‚Äôt yet have a translation mechanism for comments, that meant that our documentation had to be in English for everyone. Now, we‚Äôve moved the descriptions into a field in our database, which will send it off to CrowdIn for translation, which means we could have a Spanish-language documentation! (If you can help with that, read this post .) We differentiate ProcessingJS from JS. We get a lot of confusion from students about which parts of what they‚Äôre learning is from JavaScript and which parts are from ProcessingJS. To try and reduce that confusion, we added headers in the docs for ‚ÄúProcessingJS‚Äù and JavaScript.

We then introduce for loops in a talk-through where we describe them as a shortcut syntax for common while loop scenarios, and like with all of our curriculum, we present the students with a coding challenge after to get them actually using for loops. In this Lined Paper challenge , we start off with a while loop and ask them to convert it to a for loop. The beginning code is: var i = 0; while (i < 20) { var lineY = 20 + (i * 20); line(0, lineY, 400, lineY); i++; } And the hint code is: for (_; _; _) { var lineY = 20 + (i * 20); line(0, lineY, 400, lineY); } For the solution, we‚Äôre looking for them to rearrange the components of the while loop into a for loop, which you can likely do easily if you‚Äôre reading this. For all of our challenges, we start them off with a fairly strict StructuredJS -based grader ‚Äì just looking for the most obvious solutions that we come up with when developing the challenge. But then we release the challenges into the wild, monitor the feedback that comes in through the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù link, and adjust the graders. Sometimes that means adding more successful match patterns for students that came up with valid alternate syntax; many times that means adding more messages to help students understand what‚Äôs wrong with their syntax. It‚Äôs always fascinating to see the many ways that new and experienced programmers come up with to write what is effectively the same program, especially in JavaScript because it is a language with multiple overlapping syntaxes ‚Äì so I thought I‚Äôd share some of the for loops variations here. Ways to get it wrong Some learners don‚Äôt quite understand the order of expressions in the for statement: for (var i < 0; i < 0; i++) { } // Warns \"The first expression in your for() should be an initialization of your counter variable, *not* a conditional check.\" A few learners put their initial variable definition outside of the for loop - which works, but defeats 1/3 of the point of the for syntax, which is what we're trying to teach: var i = 0; for (i; i < 20; i++) { } // Warns \"It looks like you're initializing your counter variable before you create the for loop. As best practice, you should be doing that as the first expression in the for().\" A few learners came up with creative new syntaxes for adding one to i , which we added regex-based messages for (since the code can't be analyzed as valid JS): i+++   // Warns \"The increment operator is only 2 plus signs after the variable name, not three.\" i ++ 1 // Warns \"It looks like you were trying to use the += operator but wrote ++ instead.\" Of course, learners also struggle with the logic of the for statement, finding all sorts of ways to produce an infinite loop, which we unfortunately can't give helpful messages for yet, due to the way our error messages are produced: for (var i = 0; i > 360; i++) { } for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) { var i = 0; } Ways to get it right Perhaps more interesting is the way that people got it right that I did not anticipate, due to my own deep-seated conventions. Typically we use i++ in our talk-throughs, but many programmers prefer += 1 . Some argue it's more intuitive, some like how easy it is to change the value, and others, like Douglas Crockford, discourage using the increment/decrement operators and bake that into linting tools. So, we now accept all of these for the increment expression: i += 1 i++ ++i Note that ++ and += are not functionally equivalent in terms of type casting, as pointed out by Nikolas Co . var s = \"hi\"; var t = \"hi\"; s++; // NaN t += 1; // hi1 And of course, a post-increment operator works slightly differently than a pre-increment operator. But, in the case of this for loop, where we have already checked that the value is a number, the difference between these operators doesn't matter. If you're curious, here is what the constraints look like for making sure that their expression is one of the accepted ones, analyzing the AST node that we parsed with Esprima : var isPlusPlus = function(ast, varName) { return ast.type === \"UpdateExpression\" && ast.operator === \"++\" && ast.argument.name === varName; }; var isPlusEqual = function(ast, varName) { return ast.type === \"AssignmentExpression\" && ast.operator === \"+=\" && ast.left.name === varName && ast.right.value === 1; }; It is fascinating to teach programming and come up with these challenge graders, because it reminds me of the many ways that new programmers can be confused about a syntax and challenges my ideas about what the right way is to program something.", "date": "2014-01-23"},

On the Computer Science team, we‚Äôve benefited immensely by their talent over the last two summers, as they‚Äôve written much of the code that powers our environment and curriculum today. Here‚Äôs a recap: Summer 2012: Jamie Wong built the entire server-side of the Khan CS platform, enabling students to save, spin off eachothers programs, and browse the community‚Äôs programs. Since then, he‚Äôs continued to work for us remotely, and recently built an entire JS testing framework for us! Jessica Liu created Computer Science tutorials, meticulously researching methodologies and iterating after gathering user feedback. If you view some of the CS tutorials you‚Äôre sure to enjoy much of her expertise and wit. She also worked on improving the usability of the editor and the curriculum, making it far easier for newbies to get up to speed. You can read more details about the Summer 2012 CS platform launch here. Summer 2013: Sophia Westwood wrote the StructuredJS library, which uses Esprima to parse JS and look for matching patterns. Leif Foged wrote our coding challenge framework, which builds on top of StructuredJS so that we can present step-by-step challenges to students and award them upon completion. On the curriculum front, Leif created challenges for conditionals, and Sophia created and delivered our Loops curriculum, helping us get to the full JS 101 curriculum that we have today. We have a lot of ideas for the problems that interns could help us tackle this summer: Teaching HTML/CSS : How can we create an amazing real-time playground for learning HTML, complete with helpful hints? How can we assess a student‚Äôs HTML with fun yet practical challenges? Complex Projects : Students are creating amazing programs on Khan Academy, like FlappyBird clones and solar system simulations. How can we make their development environment better ‚Äì like with a tabbed IDE, library importing, and more flexible canvas sizing? How can we measure program complexity and highlight the most interesting programs? Data Analysis : We have hundreds of thousands of students learning to program on our platform now, across a range of ages, genders, and locales. How can we use our data and A/B framework to improve the curriculum? Or to share what we‚Äôve learnt with the rest of the CS education community, to help improve CS education globally? If you join the team, you‚Äôll be working closely with us ‚Äî John Resig , who created jQuery and kickstarted the whole CS platform 2 years ago, and Pamela Fox , who worked on improving education at Google and Coursera before coming to Khan Academy and completely revamping the curriculum from the ground up. And we‚Äôre totally nice and cool people, too, as is clearly demonstrated in this photo. üôÇ Most importantly: This summer you will ship features that students directly interact with and benefit from. No boring rewrites, no sub-systems ‚Äì only features or analysis that are impacting students. We‚Äôre hoping to find interns that are passionate about solving the problems of teaching programming online, and ready to spend the summer with us. Interested? Apply here .

Our goal in that tutorial isn‚Äôt to teach programming ‚Äì it‚Äôs to get them excited about learning programming. We thought that one way to achieve that goal would be to give students a teaser of what they could make if they kept going ‚Äì so we added a ‚ÄúSneak Peek‚Äù talk-through , where Sophia creates a cool painting program from scratch, telling students ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt understand this program yet, but if you keep going, you will!‚Äù. Since adding that talk-through to the intro, we‚Äôve had mixed reactions. Some students say ‚Äúwow, that was so cool, makes me want to keep going!‚Äù ‚Äì but other students leave visibly confused comments. One student even created an animation to encourage those confused studnets to keep. For some, it‚Äôs a motivator. For others, it‚Äôs a de-motivator. So, that leaves us with a dilemma: Do we keep or remove the ‚ÄúSneak Peek‚Äù? What decision will result in more students learning? To help us with this decision, we utilized our A/B testing framework . We created a 50/50 test, where half the students saw ‚ÄúSneak Peek‚Äù in the curriculum and half didn‚Äôt, and measured various outcomes: how many watched the ‚ÄúIntro to Drawing‚Äù talk-through? How many completed the first coding challenge? How many completed the much later variables challenge? We wanted to see both the short-term effect and the more long-term effect, in case there was a difference. We ran that A/B test for the last week, and already had statistically significant results by the end of that week.  More than 24,000 students went through the intro curriculum during that week, and a significantly larger percentage of the ‚ÄúHide-sneak-peek‚Äù students continued on to watch the drawing talk-through and complete the coding challenges. In every measure, hiding the sneak peek resulted in greater learning outcomes: And now, we can remove the ‚ÄúSneak Peek‚Äù talk-through with a degree of confidence, because we‚Äôve seen that students are more likely to keep going if they don‚Äôt see it. This is one of the reasons that I‚Äôm personally excited about teaching on Khan Academy. We have so many students learning on our platform that we can actually do these sort of experiments and get meaningful results. When we combine these data-driven approaches like A/B testing with live user testing, surveys, and feedback, we can learn so much about the most effective ways to teach.", "date": "2014-03-03"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Challenge completion across gender and age", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/challenge-completion-across-gender-and-age/", "abstract": "Lately, I‚Äôve seen the same questions come up in the programming and CS education circles: What age is the best to start to learn programming? What‚Äôs the minimum? What‚Äôs the optimal? What type of programming should be learnt? Are both genders equally capable of learning to program? Are there ways of teaching that are more gender-neutral than others? These are interesting questions, and their answers have big implications for people creating programming curriculum and teaching it to others. Since we‚Äôre fortunate to have many students learning programming on Khan Academy and we‚Äôre logging their activity, I wanted to see if we could answer those sort of questions in relation to our programming curriculum. We currently only have gender for 10% of our users and birthdate for 13% of our users (as we introduced them as optional fields a year ago), so our data is far from complete ‚Äì but given we have such large numbers to start with, it seemed worthwhile to explore what we could find out in that set of users. Effect of gender When we look at our entire Khan Academy user base and query the user base with filled out gender information, 48% are female and 52% are male ‚Äì pretty close to half and half. That may be because we have many classroom students, and classrooms tend to be split evenly across the genders. Now, if we look specifically at the Khan Academy programming curriculum ‚Äì by looking at all the users that begin the very first coding challenge and have filled out their gender, then we have a different split: 34% are female and 66% are male. We see here a bias towards male, perhaps because much of CS learning happens outside of classrooms right now ‚Äì more of our independent learners crowd. For whatever reason (and you may be already thinking of many reasons!), more males are choosing to independently learn programming than females. We‚Äôve established that more males are doing our curriculum than females, but how well do each of them do, once they‚Äôve made the choice to start learning? That‚Äôs where it gets exciting. If we look at the completion stats for that first coding challenge, 86.2% of males complete it (20762/23940) and 86.7 of females complete it (10770/12494). Those are very close numbers- close enough that the difference could be due to statistical error. That means that males and females are just as likely to complete the coding challenge, as long as they start it. This is very encouraging, and gives us good reason to come up with initiatives to raise the numbers of females that try out the curriculum. Effect of age We basically looked at the same stats, but for age. Since the main question is how young programming can be taught (elementary school, middle school, high school, or college), I‚Äôll snippet out the data that covers that age range. As it happens, that‚Äôs also where the data is most interesting. From ages 8-25, we have challenge data from a total of 40,269 students, with some ages much better represented than others. Here‚Äôs how many students started the first coding challenge at each age: 8 512 9 1280 10 2660 11 4120 12 4068 13 3116 14 5997 15 5897 16 3207 17 2364 18 1949 19 1460 20 818 21 580 22 474 23 494 24 826 25 447 For each of the age groups, we looked at how many of them completed the challenge, and calculated the challenge completion stats (like we did with gender above). We‚Äôre attempting to answer the question as to whether someone‚Äôs age significantly affects the likelihood that they‚Äôll complete the challenge. Here are the stats for each age: 8 71.48 9 73.44 10 70.94 11 75.46 12 79.74 13 81.68 14 83.06 15 83.52 16 86.81 17 88.16 18 87.79 19 88.01 20 89.85 21 88.62 22 89.03 23 89.47 24 87.41 25 89.93 As you can see, the completion rate does increase with age, and it appears to be a significant difference. Here‚Äôs what that looks like in graph form: I have to admit, I was a little disappointed when I saw the stats. There was a part of me that was hoping that even 8 year olds would be as likely as 12 year olds ‚Äì when in fact, there‚Äôs nearly a 10% difference between them. The completion rate gets pretty stable around 16, around 86-89% . Now, there‚Äôs a lot of possible reasons why there are seemingly significant completion differences from 8 to 16, and not every reason is ‚Äúits too young to start to learn programming.‚Äù Some examples: 1) our programming environment involves a bit of basic math/spatial reasoning, which they may not feel as comfortable in 2) programming requires a degree of patience, which younger kids have less of, 3) programming involves typing skills, more so than other apps that kids may use, 4) our programming is easier on desktop browsers than iPads, and maybe young kids tend to use iPads. Some of these reasons are things we could address ‚Äì for example, we could teach a non-spatial programming environment, we could teach non-syntactic visual programming (like SCRATCH), we could teach typing skills (something we‚Äôd like to do anyway). Some of them may just be the biology of younger kids, and there being an age at which the brain is better prepared for the type of abstract concepts and reasoning involved in programming. Saying all that, the completion rates are 71% for 8-year-olds and 80% for 12-year-olds ‚Äì still pretty high rates, high enough that a teacher or parent could feel comfortable introducing their student or kids to programming, especially if they are there to support them. We look forward to continuing to explore our data, to see what we can learn about teaching programming across different demographics, and we‚Äôll be attempting to increase the percentage of our user base that has this demographic data filled out as well, to lend more significance to the results.", "date": "2014-03-04"},

We think that what CoderDojo is awesome, and wanted to try using our Khan Academy JS curriculum to teach their audience, so we worked together to put on a workshop for middle school girls, last Saturday afternoon. Around 40 girls flowed into the room on Saturday (the waitlist was 3x that!) and 10 volunteer mentors scattered around the room, while parents sat by and watched. We started off by talking about what programming is, including playing a fun game where they program each other with stacks of commands (like one of the crowd favorites: ‚Äúget on all fours‚Äù, ‚Äúcrawl 10 steps‚Äù, ‚Äúsay ‚Äòmoo'‚Äù). Then we got into actual programming in JS, working the first talk-through and challenge together. After that, we set them off to go at their own pace through the curriculum, with mentors around to help. Once they got through the drawing and coloring sections, we paired them with another ready student, and they programmed together on ‚ÄúProject: What‚Äôs for Dinner‚Äù for the rest of the time. We ended with a Show & Tell, with each pair showing off their team chant, secret handshake, and of course, their dinner.

I started going through the book myself, porting the programs to JavaScript and trying the suggested exercises. It was so much fun that I thought, hey, let‚Äôs put this on Khan Academy so that all of our students can have this much fun learning! Fortunately, author Daniel Shiffman CC-licensed the book, so we were allowed to port over the text, and add our interactive coding challenges and projects on top. We‚Äôve just released the new course as ‚ÄúAdvanced JS: Natural Simulations,‚Äù and we think that teachers and students alike will find it a great way to practice JavaScript, learn new ProcessingJS functionality, and brush up on basic math and physics concepts along the way. Here‚Äôs a run-down of the units, to give you a better idea of what‚Äôs covered: Randomness : Learn about randomness, probability, and normal distributions, and use those techniques to make all sorts of ‚Äúrandom walkers.‚Äù Noise : Learn about Perlin noise, which you can then use to create animated clouds and mountain ranges. Vectors : Learn how to program with vectors and use them to simulate lightsabers, braking cars, and mouse-following motion. Forces : Use forces to make more realistic simulations, modeling gravity, friction, and fluid resistance. Angular movement : Use angles, polar coordinates, and trigonometry to simulate angular movement like batons spinning, boulders rolling, and cars rotating as they turn. Oscillations : See how you can use the sine function to model simple harmonic motion, how to simulate a pendulum, and how to program Hooke‚Äôs law for spring forces. Create programs that simulate slinkies, waves, and puppets along the way. Particle Systems : Now that you‚Äôve learned many ways to program the movement of single objects, you‚Äôll create particle systems, the standard way that games and movies simulate movement of groups of particles, like for smoke, wind, fire, and water.

Since the goal of the talk was to give everyone an action item to lower a barrier in some way, here‚Äôs a run-down of the ways you can help: Donate hardware : You can donate your own unused laptops to local schools or organizations (like Boys & Girls Club, YMCA, or coding specific ones ). Fund a DonorsChoose.org project : You can search on DonorsChoose.org for projects that are funding laptops to teach CS in their classrooms. You can also filter by topic, poverty level, or location, and you can turn your donations into a gift in the name of a friend or family member. Contribute to online programming environments : You can contribute to existing open-source environments like repl.it , jsbin.com , or to the tools that power them like JSHint , ACE editor . You could also build curriculum around existing environments, or create an entirely new environment, like for Arduino, Objective-C, or 3D games. Make CS count in your K-12 state/district : You can visit code.org/promote , select your state, and follow the instructions to sign a petition or email a politician. You could also write letters to your local high school, especially if you have a student there, and offer to explain to the administration why it‚Äôs important. Perhaps you could even volunteer to teach yourself (like via the TEALS program or mentor a teacher. Volunteer at a local coding club : Search on code.org/local/learn for local coding clubs, and volunteer as a mentor or teacher. If you can‚Äôt find one, start one (like a CoderDojo chapter). You can use online self-guided curriculum like Khan Academy , so you don‚Äôt even have to feel comfortable teaching. Encourage your kids : According to recent Google research , encouragement ‚Äì especially parental ‚Äì is very important. Encourage your kids, especially daughters, but do not pressure them. Clear up misconceptions about CS as a career : Many students don‚Äôt know what CS is like as a career and realize that it can have social impact. Share stories of CS in the real world, like from Khan Academy‚Äôs Meet the Computing Professional , Computing is Everywhere , Made With Code . Share those with kids you know, and encourage teachers to highlight one a week.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Peer evaluations for coding projects on Khan Academy", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/peer-evaluations-for-coding-projects-on-khan-academy/", "abstract": "In our programming courses on Khan Academy, we have two ways that students practice what they‚Äôve learnt: challenges and projects . A tutorial showing both challenges and a project Challenges give you step by step instructions, and help guide you through learning a new concept ‚Äì like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a black and white ice cream cup, color it in with fill commands.‚Äù Projects  are more free-form. They give you a goal to complete, and let you loose  to be creative and get practice with programming ‚Äì like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs an empty plate, draw something to eat on it, using any of the commands you just learned.‚Äù Challenges can be checked for validity automatically using structured.js which parses a student‚Äôs program into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Each challenge has grading code that matches the user‚Äôs code against known good structures and outputs messages for known bad structures. But for projects, the student‚Äôs code varies so much that they can‚Äôt be graded as easily automatically ‚Äì and that‚Äôs a good thing, we love seeing the variety in the programs that pop up. We still wanted some way to judge projects as being done, however, and to give students feedback on what they‚Äôd written. To do this, we‚Äôve now introduced the concept of project evaluations: rubric-based code reviews that students can learn from and improve their program based on. What‚Äôs it like to be an evaluator? If a member of our community is eligible to be an evaluator, they can visit our project feedback page to see a list of the projects awaiting evaluation. For  each project, there‚Äôs a list of objectives that the reviewer should  look out for.¬† Each objective can be marked as ‚ÄúPassed‚Äù or ‚ÄúNeeds more work‚Äù. Performing an evaluation When there‚Äôs a failed objective, the evaluator can leave additional comments, to give the student ideas of ways they can meet that objective. The evaluator can additionally leave additional comments at the end, which they often use to leave encouraging remarks or pro tips. What‚Äôs it like to be a student? When  a student starts on a project, they are given a summary of what to  do and the project is marked as started. When they decide they‚Äôre finished working on a project, they can request an evaluation. What the person doing the project sees After  some time, the evaluation will happen, and if it‚Äôs successful, the student ¬†will then get a notification that their project is now marked as completed, or needs more work. If it needs more work, the student will make adjustments and re-request evaluation.¬† Once the project evaluation passes, the student will get points for their project. How is eligibility determined for evaluators? Community members who have earned the ‚ÄúIntro to JS mastery badge‚Äù are eligible to do peer evaluations.¬†They can earn this badge by completing the ‚ÄúIntro to JS: Drawing & Animation‚Äù computer programming course. The eligibility may be tweaked in the future depending on the mean wait time of project evaluation requests and the quality of reviews. How did the launch go? So far, the launch has gone amazing. There‚Äôs an initial surge of project evaluations to be caught up with, but we‚Äôre hoping to keep the average wait time around a day.¬† We‚Äôve immediately seen hundreds of project evaluation requests as well as dozens of awesome and supportive evaluations. The advanced programmers in our community love the opportunity to help new programmers learn: They‚Äôre also forthcoming with their praise for a well done program ‚Äì both in terms of functionality and readability. We‚Äôve also got a ton of great feedback from the top evaluators, and we‚Äôll continue iterating on the system (just like the students are iterating on their projects) to help our community keep learning from each other.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Peer evaluations: one month retrospective", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/peer-evaluations-one-month-retrospective/", "abstract": "A few weeks ago we launched a new feature called Project Evaluations in the Computer Programming section on Khan Academy. This feature allows students to request evaluations on the coding projects that they complete. Another peer on the site would then see their evaluation request, evaluate them based on a rubric, and if they passed, they‚Äôd earn points for the project. This blog post will analyze the data we‚Äôve gathered since launching the feature, and talk about various changes we‚Äôve made to address challenges that came up. Uh oh, too many requests! In the first day, we got a big surge of project evaluation requests. We thought this might have been because it was just released, but it turns out that it would be normal traffic. Overall only 20% of evaluation requests were being satisfied per day in the first few days. That meant that every day, the average wait queue for getting an evaluation was getting longer.¬† The challenge was clear: How do we increase the amount of evaluations, without losing quality on the evaluations? First 4 days since launch (Horizontal axis) vs. New evaluation requests (Purple) per day and evaluations (Pink) per day (Vertical axis) We overcame this challenge relatively quickly, but only by making dozens of small changes. See below for a list of all of those. The same chart over a longer period of time shows the effect of these small changes.¬† You‚Äôll notice that the Evaluations (pink) bars start to dominate the requests (Purple)¬† bars per day. Days since launch (Horizontal axis) vs. New evaluation requests (Purple) per day and evaluations (Pink) per day (Vertical axis) Aggregating all of this data together gives us a pretty good picture of where we‚Äôre at today. Overall ‚ÄúEvaluated‚Äù (Green) vs ‚ÄúPending evaluation‚Äù (Blue) How did we increase evaluations? We started off by thinking about what sort of people might evaluate projects, and there are a few key groups: current students: those that are going through the curriculum themselves, alumni: the students that have completed the curriculum (but may not be particularly active), super users: those that already know how to program (via our curriculum or elsewhere) and are already active in the community coaches of current students When we launched, we only let the curriculum alumni perform evaluations, so all of the evaluations were coming from students that were both very active (enough to notice the new feature) and had completed the curriculum. They‚Äôre still some of our most prolific reviewers, but we realized we needed to bring in more types of reviewers from across our student base, and that‚Äôs where we made a lot of changes‚Äì Lowering the bar overall: We made it so that simply completing any coding challenge would qualify you to be a reviewer (which would enable us to bring in more types of reviewers). To offset the lowered bar for performing evaluations, we added moderation tools and flagging to ensure quality is maintained. Bring in current students as evaluators: We added a next action after a student submits a project and passes a project, which is a link to evaluate another students‚Äô project. Those projects are picked based on the highest difficulty level that the student has passed themselves. Bringing in more alumni reviewers: We sent out notifications letting thousands of people know about the new feature, and that they were eligible to evaluate. We added a video that every student will watch at the end of the curriculum, showing them how they can be active in the community in various ways. We added a notification that will get sent to every student when they earn the curriculum badge, encouraging them to be active. Encouraging more super users: We made the page listing evaluations requests easier to find and linked to it from more places. We enabled the reviewers to be more efficient by presenting them immediately with a link to do another evaluation when they‚Äôre done with the current one, or to skip the current evaluation if it isn‚Äôt right for them. We added features to make evaluations more useful (such as allowing for formatted code inside evaluations). We added evaluations to profiles so that reviewers can show off the evaluations they‚Äôve done. Bringing in coach reviewers: We improved coach integration so coaches can view which of their students‚Äô projects are pending. We added a notification for coaches to find out about a students‚Äô project evaluation request. Besides increasing the number of reviewers, we also reduced the number of requests, by adding messaging to prompt the students requesting evaluation to fix their own problems before asking for an evaluation. How accurate are the evaluations? We‚Äôve seen very few cases of bad evaluations (like students making un-constructive negative comments, or failing projects that should pass), and we‚Äôre generally very pleased with the quality of evaluations. We‚Äôve heard reviewers comment that they‚Äôve learnt from the requestor‚Äôs code, and seen reviewers share valuable tidbits of knowledge that wouldn‚Äôt be gained otherwise. We do have more work in progress for monitoring and understanding the quality of evaluations at a deeper level. What‚Äôs the distribution of evaluations across reviewers? Initially, there was a very small amount of reviewers with a few outliers. Since the changes we‚Äôve made, we‚Äôve managed to bring in a lot more people trying reviews. Over 4,000 people have performed at least one review.¬† 2,000 have performed 1-2 evaluations, and around 100 have performed over 60. The top evaluator has performed a staggering 3400 evaluations on their own. Shows the number of people (vertical axis) who performed that many evaluates (x-axis) How many projects pass? Another interesting metric is how often students actually pass the evaluation.¬† During the first few days, only 54% of evaluations passed. By adding ways for users to catch their own problems before submitting for review, we‚Äôve helped turn this into 66% passing rate. This lead to less failed evaluations, and in general it feels better when your evaluation passes! It‚Äôs worth noting that evaluations are an iterative process. When a project is marked as needing more work, the user will typically make changes and request evaluation. So even without our changes, we‚Äôd expect to see a growing number of passing evaluations over time. ‚ÄúPassing‚Äù evaluations (Green) vs. ‚ÄúNeeds more work‚Äù evaluations (Blue) Closely monitoring changes in data We‚Äôve caught up with evaluations vs. requests but we‚Äôll continue to watch this data closely. From what we‚Äôve gathered so far, it seems like peer evaluations works well and people are getting good evaluations on their projects.¬† We‚Äôll be monitoring and focusing on quality of evaluations even more in the coming weeks. Bring in current students as evaluators: We added a next action after a student submits a project and passes a project, which is a link to evaluate another students‚Äô project. Those projects are picked based on the highest difficulty level that the student has passed themselves. Bring in current students as evaluators: Bringing in coach reviewers: We improved coach integration so coaches can view which of their students‚Äô projects are pending.

It‚Äôs a sequence of steps that you follow to solve a problem. In everyday life, you might have an algorithm for hanging up your laundry, efficiently going through a shopping list, or finding an empty parking space in a lot. In computer science, an algorithm is a sequence of instructions that a computer program follows. Algorithms form the basis of the most interesting and important programs we use, such as the algorithm that Google uses to calculate driving directions, or the algorithm that Facebook uses to automatically tag you in a photo. Because algorithms are so important to computer science, they are a core part of a computer science curriculum. The AP CS A class teaches object-oriented programming with algorithms, ¬†every college CS student will have at least one algorithms class and encounter algorithms everywhere, and every software engineer interviewing for a job will review algorithms while they‚Äôre prepping for an interview. Given how important algorithms are, we were elated when Dartmouth professors Thomas Cormen and Devin Balkcom suggested writing an online course on Algorithms, available to anyone for free, forever, on Khan Academy. If you‚Äôre a college CS student, you might recognize the name ‚ÄúCormen‚Äù ‚Äì he‚Äôs the ‚ÄúC‚Äù in the ‚ÄúCLRS‚Äù-authored Algorithms textbook, the most popular algorithms textbook used by college classes.

Algorithms can be hard to wrap your head around, so we have both step-by-step diagrams and interactive visualizations to explain each algorithm: We also want to give you a chance to try coding the algorithms yourself, so we‚Äôve used our JavaScript coding challenge framework to create 20 challenges with unit tests (and you‚Äôll have to write unit tests yourself!): We‚Äôve also sprinkled in a few quizzes, to make sure you understand concepts like asymptotic and graph notation: This curriculum covers everything you‚Äôd find in an intro course ‚Äì asymptotic notation, binary search, selection/insertion sort, recursion, merge/quick sort, graph representation, and breadth first search.

We lived a few hours walk from the shops in town, and I had to walk by a high-security penitentiary to get to those shops ‚Äì given the recent surge in prison escapes, I didn‚Äôt feel like taking the risk. I‚Äôd been browsing the web a lot recently, checking out the fan websites for my favorite boy bands and hanging out in pet-themed chat rooms. I always liked the idea of making gifts instead of buying gifts, so I thought ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôll make my mum a webpage!‚Äù I searched on Yahoo! for instructions (this was even before the days of Google‚Äôing), and made a webpage for my mum with a big cheesy ‚ÄúHappy Mother‚Äôs Day‚Äù GIF at the top (thanks, Microsoft Word Art!).

Well, JavaScript was originally invented in order to bring HTML/CSS web pages to life, to make them interactive with events and animation.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "The most common syntax mistakes from SQL newbies", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/the-most-common-syntax-mistakes-from-sql-newbies/", "abstract": "We teach SQL on Khan Academy by embedding SQLite.js inside our real-time editor . In our courses, students first learn how a concept works in an interactive talk-through and then they work through a step-by-step SQL-writing challenge . We‚Äôve now had thousands of learners attempt the SQL challenges in our SQL course. Many of those figure out how to write correct SQL and pass the challenges. But a big fraction of them struggle to write SQL correctly the first time and bang their head over syntax errors. When that happens, I get a JIRA report with their code and any other colorful language they‚Äôd like to express üôÇ A few weeks ago, I triaged nearly 2,000 reports from our first 3 challenges, and I was fascinated to see the huge variety of syntax errors. Some of the errors kept popping up ‚Äì here were the top 3: Students putting a whitespace in their table name. Students missing semi-colons after SELECT or INSERT statements. Students spelling INTEGER as INTERGER and not noticing that extra ‚ÄòR‚Äô. For most syntax errors, students used to see ‚Äúsyntax error near [token]‚Äù and nothing else ‚Äì so they knew something was wrong near a line of their SQL but had no other clues about why their SQL was wrong.  To help those new SQLers out, I added more specific messages using simple regex-based checks. For example, the students from before will now see these messages: You can‚Äôt have a space in your table name. Do you have a semi-colon after each statement? Is INTEGER spelled correctly? As I saw more repeat errors across learners, I just kept adding more messages. Here‚Äôs a table of all the messages I added: example SQL message CREATE TABLE books (id PRIMARY KEY INTEGER,name TEXT,rating INTEGER ); Did you mean to put PRIMARY KEY after INTEGER? CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, rating INTEGER; Are you missing a parenthesis?‚Äù]); CREATE books(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY name TEXT); You may be missing what to create. For example, CREATE TABLE‚Ä¶ CREATE TABLE (name TEXT); Are you missing the table name?‚Äù]); CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,name,TEXT,rating INTEGER); Do you have an extra comma between the name and type? CREATE TABLE booklist (id, INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, rating INTEGER); Do you have an extra comma between the name and type? CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, rating out of ten INTEGER); You can‚Äôt have a space in your column name. INSERT INTO FavBooks VALUES (1, Beautiful Creatures, 10); Are you missing quotes around text values? CREATE TABLE books (name TEXT) INSERT INTO books VALUES (1, 'book a', 100) INSERT INTO books VALUES (2, 'book b', 110) INSERT INTO books VALUES (3, 'book c', 1) Do you have a semi-colon after each statement? INSERT, INTO books VALUES (1, \"gone with the wind\", 1); There shouldn‚Äôt be a comma after INSERT. CREATE TABLE customers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY); INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1); INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1); Are you specifying a different value for each row? CREATE TABLE customers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, id TEXT); You have multiple columns named `id` ‚Äì column names must be unique. I stopped there, but there‚Äôs still much more work to do: I put 23 more syntax error situations in a Github issue on our live-editor open source repo . If you‚Äôre interested in making SQL easier to learn, I encourage you to submit a PR for that issue or any other SQL-related issues .

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Migrating to a Mobile Monorepo for React Native", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/migrating-to-a-mobile-monorepo-for-react-native/", "abstract": "By Jared Forsyth Over the past few months, we‚Äôve been adding some React Native to our existing iOS and Android apps. We started out by just creating a react-native repository and adding it as a submodule of our respective ios and android git repositories, but we quickly found that there was a fair amount of friction in coordinating between the three. We‚Äôve now moved all of our mobile-related repositories (including a mobile-scripts and a shared-webview repository) into a single mobile monorepo . Why did we do it? When making changes to the bridge that JavaScript uses to get data from the native side, we need to make the change to both the Android and the iOS codebases, or else we‚Äôll get runtime errors. With three repositories to work with, it was too easy to forget to add one or the other (as you‚Äôre generally developing with just one simulator open), resulting in a broken experience for one platform or the other. We‚Äôd also get into a state where the master branch of react-native contained some changes that had only been coordinated with e.g. the ios repo, and the android repo‚Äôs react-native submodule would be several commits behind. Then someone working on the Android side would update the submodule, and they‚Äôd have to track down all the breakages. In short, we started running into a lot of synchronization issues that wouldn‚Äôt happen if all of the code was in the same repository. With a monorepo, pull requests could be combined, reviews would be more coherent, and it would be easier to verify correctness between codebases. Anticipated pros changing bridge between JavaScript and native would be easier because you‚Äôd only need a single pull request instead of three as a result, they would be less likely to get out of sync not having to mess with submodules üéâ Anticipated cons we might lose Git history (this didn‚Äôt turn out to be the case) we‚Äôd have to change all of our Jenkins build scripts moving all our developers to a new repository requires coordination we‚Äôd lose any in-flight branches and open PRs to the old repositories (we actually found a solution for this too) What were the steps? Setup Make a fresh monorepo: sh mkdir mobile; cd mobile; git init . Have all the repos that you want to combine cloned and fully up to date sh $ ls . mobile android ios react-native Preparing the repos for merging Clone each repo into m_reponame (using android as the example) and then move all files into a subfolder (except for .git , of course). sh git clone android m_android cd m_android mkdir android mv * .* android mv android/.git . Then commit the result: git add . && git commit -m'move to subfolder' With the code for each respective codebase moved into a subdirectory, we‚Äôre then able to move them all into a single repository without having them clash with each other. To illustrate, here‚Äôs what the rough directory structure looks like: android/   build.gradle, etc. ios/   AppDelegate.m, etc. react-native/   index.ios.js, etc. m_android/   android/     build.gradle, etc. m_ios/   ios/     AppDelegate.m, etc. m_react-native/   react-native/     index.ios.js, etc. The monorepo will then have the following structure: mobile/   android/     build.gradle, etc.   ios/     AppDelegate.m, etc.   react-native/     index.ios.js, etc. Merge each m_reponame into the monorepo Turns out git has super powers, and can totally merge in multiple unrelated repositories and preserve all the relevant git history. Who knew? sh cd mobile git fetch ../m_android git merge FETCH_HEAD --no-ff --allow-unrelated-histories      -m 'merging in android repo' Again, do this for each repository that you need to merge in. One thing I‚Äôm glossing over (that you‚Äôll have to figure out manually) is various dotfiles that you want to be shared. .gitignore is fine being in the respective subdirectories, but in our case we use Phabricator, and so we needed to make a top-level .arcconfig file that merged the .arcconfig s from the previous three repositories. I also had to manually bring over submodules, by re-cloning them in the new monorepo and checking them out at the commit where they were pinned in the pre-monorepo repositories. And of course the react-native folder was in a different place now that it wasn‚Äôt a submodule, but a peer, to the iOS and Android codebases, so we had to update various relative paths and build scripts. Bringing in new changes from the old repos After creating the monorepo, our team had a flex week where they could still operate on the old repositories, so that they could land any outstanding code changes that they had inflight and move over at their own pace. If you do the same, here‚Äôs how to bring in new changes to the old repositories: sh (cd android && git pull) cd m_android git pull ../android --no-ff      -m 'merging in latest android changes' At this point check for new files . Files that were added in the android repo after the monorepo move will not get automatically moved into the m_android/android subdirectory. It will be pretty obvious, because the only directory in the m_android repo should be android . If there‚Äôs anything else there, git mv the_new_thing android && git commit -am \"moving new files into subdirectory\" before continuing. sh cd ../mobile git fetch ../m_android git merge FETCH_HEAD --no-ff      -m 'merging in latest android changes' This will even work if there have been changes committed to the monorepo, although you may have to resolve merge conflicts. Following Git history across the monorepo divide One of the things that surprised me the most was that Git was totally able to track the changes, even though they came from three different repositories. When doing git log for a specific file, you just need to add the --follow option (which tells Git to follow the file across renames), and everything works! And that‚Äôs it! We‚Äôve been working with the monorepo for over a month now, and it‚Äôs been well worth it. If you‚Äôre integrating React Native into two existing apps that are currently in separate repositories, you might benefit from the shift as well!", "date": "2017-05-29"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Minimizing the length of regular expressions, in practice", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/minimizing-the-length-of-regular-expressions-in-practice/", "abstract": "By Craig Silverstein The problem Software engineering interviews tend to be full of ‚Äùalgorithms‚Äù questions, because they‚Äôre easy to explore in an hour, unlike the messy problems that most programmers deal with day-to-day: moving data from one place to another, error checking and recovery, etc. Most times when I do have to use a fancy algorithm, there‚Äôs already a library to do it for me. But every so often I come across the need for a novel, non-trivial algorithm. This happened to me the other week, and the process of getting it to work was, I think, really interesting. Here is the problem: we wanted to improve the way we serve Khan Academy urls by fetching our static urls (images, fonts, etc) from a different place than our dynamic urls (homepage, /exercises, etc). The way we would do this would be to give our CDN (the cache-friendly frontend that actually gets our urls are forwards them on to us) a regular expression that matches all our static urls. The CDN would know what to do based on whether the regexp matched the incoming url or not. Here‚Äôs the trick: our CDN limits the size of this url to 512 characters. It would be nice if we could just have a url like ^/static/.* , but sadly our static urls are not organized in any way, and some of them are in third-party code, so it‚Äôs not practical to just reorganize them. It would also be nice if we could just have a regexp like .*.(js|css|png|jpg|pdf) , but sadly, we have some png files that are dynamically generated, and we have other dynamic routes that would match that regexp as well, such as /api/internal/ios/static_redirect/mobile-exercise-content-5.css . So I had to do something more clever. My assets Google Appengine, which is the hosting platform we use, has you specify which resources are static files for its own purposes. You do this via a configuration file that has entries like this: ‚Äú` {.yaml} ‚Äì url: /images   static_dir: images url: /((fonts|khan-exercises|third party)/.*.eot) static files: 1 mime type: application/vnd.ms-opentype upload: ((fonts|khan-exercises|third party)/.*.eot) url: /((fonts|khan-exercises|third party)/.*.woff) static files: 1 mime type: application/vnd.ms-opentype upload: ((fonts|khan-exercises|third party)/.*.woff) ‚Äú` The first kind just says that urls of the form /wp-content/uploads/engblog/* should be served by files on the local filesystem named images/* . The second kind is more complicated: images matching that input regexp should be served by files matching the static_files parameter. ( 1 means: everything inside the outermost parenthesis of url .) First solution: 402,025 characters long The naive approach I tried first was to just use values of static_dir and static_files from the config file, match them against every file in our repository, and join them all together into a big regexp: {.} ^/downloads/KAOperationalPlan.xls$| ^/downloads/KhanAcademyAccounts.pdf$| ...| ^/videos/homepage-background.webm$ This regular expression was too big for our CDN. It‚Äôs also very fragile: we‚Äôd need to update the regexp in our CDN every time we added a new static file to our filesystem. Second solution: 2,400 characters long Next, I realized that the config file already listed regular expressions, so I could just concatenate those together instead: {.} ^/images| ^/((fonts|khan-exercises|third_party)/.*.eot)| ^/((fonts|khan-exercises|third_party)/.*.woff)| ... This is a lot smaller than the above solution, and also more robust since we‚Äôd only need to change the CDN regexp any time we changed the config file, not every time we added a new file to our filesystem. But it was still well over the 512 character limit. Third solution: 824 characters long My next thought was to take the url from the second solution, and ‚Äùoptimize‚Äù it. The problem of how to minimize a regular expression is actually well studied. Unfortunately, the studying is to show how hard it is. ( PSPACE-complete , which is ‚Äî probably ‚Äî even harder than NP-complete.) (There‚Äôs also several well known results as to how to minimize the number of states in deterministic finite automata. But while DFAs are very closely related to regular expressions, minimizing the number of states in a DFA is not very related to minimizing the number of characters in a regular expression.) But there are things you can do in practice to get a smaller regexp, even if not a minimal one, and it may be enough for your purposes. In this case, the biggest win seemed to be in combining shared prefixes, to end up with a url like: {.} ^/images| ^/((fonts|khan-exercises|third_party)/.*.(eot|woff))| ... I could not find any resources for how to combine shared prefixes in regular expressions, so I had to come up with an approach on my own. This was surprisingly difficult. My first approach was to just sort the regexp patterns and then go through them one by one, keeping track of how much of the prefix of this url matched the next one. This worked in simple cases, but I could not figure out how to get it to do the right thing for nested parens like g(a(e_mini_profiler/|ndalf/)|enfiles/) . I gave up on that approach and eventually came around to an approach that just did one combine-step at a time. Given my list of regexps that I wanted to join together with | , I‚Äôd find the two that shared the longest prefix. (If there were multiple such pairs, I picked one arbitrarily.) I‚Äôd then combine those two to be ( | ) . I‚Äôd then repeat this algorithm again, but with one fewer regexp in my list than before. Eventually my ‚Äùlist‚Äù would have only one regexp in it, and I‚Äôd be done. There were two wrinkles to this approach. Sometimes three or more regexps would share a longest prefix: {.} ^/((fonts|khan-exercises|third_party)/.*.eot ^/((fonts|khan-exercises|third_party)/.*.woff ^/((fonts|khan-exercises|third_party)/.*.otf In that case, I‚Äôd combine all of them at once. Second, I had to be careful of cases where the shared longest prefix was inside parentheses: {.} ^/((fonts|khan-exercises|third_party)/.*.woff ^/((fonts|khan-exercises)/.*.svg I didn‚Äôt want to combine them to get ^/((fonts|khan-exercises(|third_party)/.*.woff|)/.*.svg) ! That does not match what I want it to match. So I had to tokenize the regular expressions first, so that each parenthetical expression was considered a single ‚Äùcharcter‚Äù. Afer all this work, my regular expression had lots of nice parentheses in it, but was still 824 characters long. Fourth solution: 208 characters long This is where I had my big breakthrough. I realized my goal wasn‚Äôt to find a regexp that matched all our static file urls, it was to find a regexp that distinguished our static-file urls from our dynamic urls. This difference is subtle but important. For the second formulation we don‚Äôt care what our regexp does with invalid Khan Academy urls, that is, urls that yield a 404. (In the first case, we‚Äôd have to make sure that all invalid KA urls were judged not-static.) After all, we don‚Äôt care if our static-content provider or our dynamic-content provider is the one who gives the 404! After this realization, I changed the way I thought about the static-file url regexps in our config file. I took each such regexp and shortened it to the shortest prefix that didn‚Äôt match any of our dynamic urls (such as /videos/* ). This yielded a very minimal regexp: I could shorten, say, ^/genfiles/javascript/.*|^/genfiles/stylesheets/.* to just ^/ge . The result was well under 512 characters! Fifth solution: 294 characters long The fourth solution worked, but it was probably too minimal. If someone were to later add a dynamic route /get_id , say, to our website, the regexp-pattern ^/ge would cause the CDN would think that all /get_id urls were actually for a static file, and not forward them to the right place. This would cause confusion and trouble. We could go through efforts to make sure everyone updated the CDN regular expression every time they added a dynamic route to our app, but that seemed like a lot of work and also error-prone. So instead I made the prefixes a bit less minimal, by forcing them to end on a slash. So instead of taking the unique prefix ^/ge , we‚Äôd take the still-unique prefix ^genfiles/ . This increased the sizes of our regexp by almost 50{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}, but it‚Äôs still well under 512 characters, and the robustness improvement makes it well worthwhile. The big reveal Are you curious what our final url was? Here it is. (I‚Äôve broken it into multiple lines to make it a bit easier to read.) {.} ^/( (fonts|khan-exercises|third_party)/.*.(eot$|otf$|svg$|ttf$|woff($|2$))| .well-known/apple-app-site-association$| admin/extbackup/static/| ckeditor/| downloads/| g(a(e_mini_profiler/static/|ndalf/static/)|enfiles/)| images/| javascript/| khan-exercises/(css/|images/|third_party/|utils/)| s(ounds/|tylesheets/)| third_party/| videos/ ) Not the shortest url in the world ‚Äî there are some mini-optimizations that could make it even smaller, such as replacing ($|2$) with 2?$ ‚Äî but well within the 512-character limit, and pretty reasonable to read. If you‚Äôre interested in seeing how we got this, here is the source code . The bits to calculate the input routes are specific to Khan Academy, but the rest should be more generally useful.", "date": "2016-05-23"},

You should do it too! It‚Äôs really easy and pays off quickly. All you have to do is make personal calendar events for everything you did at work each day, and you‚Äôll have data about where all your time goes. Having more data available is really cool. It lets you make decisions with more information, and alleviates a lot of doubt as to whether you‚Äôve considered all possible options. I time-track everything I do. I use Google Calendar because it‚Äôs easy, and all I had to do to get started was create a few more calendars: {.align-center width=‚Äù50.0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}‚Äù} Here‚Äôs what an example week looks like (with titles hidden): {.align-center width=‚Äù100.0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}‚Äù} Here I‚Äôve hidden the titles of all my tasks, because I really do track everything and I‚Äôd rather not share all the details, but I found a week where I can publicly share at least the work-related tasks (red) in full: {.align-center width=‚Äù100.0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}‚Äù} As you can see, the titles aren‚Äôt very specific, and many of them are just copied directly from my work calendar. The important part is to get the gist of where the time went. Since I have my calendar open for most of the day the added overhead of clicking and typing what I‚Äôve been doing for the past half hour is really minimal, and in return I get to know (months later) that I spent a lot of time during that week talking to people on the team to make sure everyone was on the same page, and triaging development tasks in Asana. (This was a week where I was wrapping up being the tech lead of an 8-month project ‚Äî nicknamed ‚ÄúBibliotron‚Äù ‚Äî and also on a support rotation where I was fixing bugs from our support queue.) I also spent a lot of time working in the evenings since we were in a time crunch that week. If you‚Äôre not totally freaking out about the idea of seeing your life in such detail, read on to learn more about why on Earth I do this. About a year ago, I realized that I had very low self esteem about my work life. I was constantly worried that I wasn‚Äôt getting enough done, and that people would figure out that I wasn‚Äôt a good developer. Anyone who has been down that road knows that it self-propagates: having low self-esteem causes you to take on less responsibility, which makes you stagnate, which makes you feel like you aren‚Äôt very good, and so on. It‚Äôs a cycle that‚Äôs really hard to break. The biggest thing that was keeping me down was that I had no idea where my time was going. At the end of each week I knew that I had been at work for an adequate amount of time, that I had put in effort, but I didn‚Äôt have very much to show for it. The weird part about being a developer is that you do produce a lot of really solid relics of the time you spend working ‚Äî commits, docs, features being deployed ‚Äî but you also spend a lot of time chewing on hard problems and bugs, and not having much to show for it other than a better solution later. It makes it hard to figure out what time was wasted. Then I started time tracking, and in the past year I went from having almost no confidence in my engineering abilities to being the technical lead on not one, but two of Khan Academy‚Äôs major initiatives. I‚Äôm still pinching myself, because I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a dream, but I‚Äôll go ahead and finish this blog post so other people in this dream kingdom can benefit too. The biggest difference between me now and me a-year-ago is that I no longer worry that I‚Äôm not getting enough done. I don‚Äôt have to worry because I know where all of my time is going, even if I‚Äôm wasting it! It‚Äôs empowering to have data. Fear of not getting enough done leads to a lot of bad things: Paralysis: Every task that crosses your mind spins around in the decision tree of ‚Äúis this worth my time? I haven‚Äôt done enough today so I probably should do something more important? Is this important?‚Äù Stress: Your body gets all knotted up and anxious whether you like it or not. You worry that someone will ask you what you did last week and you won‚Äôt know what to say. Time slips away from you and you obsess over losing it. Working on weekend and in the evenings: If you don‚Äôt feel like you got enough done in the day you‚Äôre more likely to go home and keep pushing yourself to work. Working overtime isn‚Äôt always a bad thing, but if you already feel like you‚Äôre behind, chances are you‚Äôre just going to make it worse by not giving yourself any time to relax. Fear of talking to your manager: It‚Äôs really important that you have a good relationship with your manager and can talk to them about what you‚Äôve been working on. If you can say ‚Äúthese are the things I worked on this week, can you go through them with me and help me find ways to make better use of my time?‚Äù then you can take advantage of the relationship to become an even better developer and make your manager happy in the process, If you‚Äôre constantly scared of your manager finding out that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve been working on then your relationship and growth are going to suffer. My solution to not knowing where my time was going was to write things down. I‚Äôve time-tracked before, but with a different purpose. My first job out of college was at a design & development agency where I was paid hourly and had to submit detailed time sheets for each client. The time tracking has a major, and very crucial, difference: I time my track for my own gain . Not for my manager, not for a client, not to show off. The most important part of doing this is that you remember that you‚Äôre time-tracking for you and you alone. Don‚Äôt let other people see where your time is going. In order to get good data, and to figure out where you‚Äôre wasting time, you need to be honest . When you spend a half an hour reading tech news, write it down. Pick a different colored calendar for your wasted time. No one will see it, and you‚Äôll soon learn that after you send off some code for review you typically spend a half an hour not knowing what to do with yourself. Tracking your time will give you data. I‚Äôm a scientist! I love data. You might not love data though, and data can be overwhelming. Having data is always better than not having it, but here are some ways you can put the data to use: Look at where your time goes: It only takes a minute to scan through your week and see where your time went, and it will better equip you to say ‚Äúno‚Äù when someone tries to put something else on your plate, or push yourself to block off a few hours of ‚Äúheads down coding time‚Äù every day. Feel more productive: Every so often you get to write down what you‚Äôve been working on. After a while it turns into a great feeling of self-competition to make the most of your time. You‚Äôve got a half an hour left before lunch ‚Äî why not fill it with those code reviews you‚Äôve been meaning to do? Work reasonable hours: If at the end of the day you can look back and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked 8 solid hours today!‚Äù then you can go relax without having the fear weighing on you. Talk to your manager: Before your weekly/bi-weekly/monthly meeting with your manager or team lead, glance over what you‚Äôve been up to since you last talked. Where has your time been going? Have you been swamped with email? Is that low-touch side-project of onboarding new developers actually taking up tons of your time? You manager can give you advice, help advocate for you, and shift around responsibilities to make sure you‚Äôre in a good place. (Bonus: Their job is to make sure you‚Äôre making the best use of your time, so they‚Äôll love you for helping making their job easier!) Advocate for yourself in your self-review: You now have a record of all the cool things you‚Äôve been working on! Bring them up with your manager during review-season and make sure those cool things you‚Äôve been working on don‚Äôt go unnoticed. Write weekly summaries: I‚Äôve been combining time-tracking data with writing weekly snippets , which are weekly summaries that each person at Khan Academy writes to share what they‚Äôve been working on with the team. Writing snippets becomes much easier if at the end of each week you can see exactly what you spent time on. If you do want to try this out, start small . It took me many weeks to get into the habit of writing down everything, and for the first while I just tracked work, then added in sleep and exercise. I now track everything because it‚Äôs fun and I‚Äôm weird, but feel free to just try the work part. There are also apps out there that will track your sleep and movement for you, which will help immensely with filling in data after the fact. At this point it‚Äôs pretty much effortless to keep on top of it, and has saved me many times. Good luck, and happy time-tracking!", "date": "2016-08-08"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "tota11y ‚Äì an accessibility visualization toolkit", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/tota11y-an-accessibility-visualization-toolkit/", "abstract": "By Jordan Scales Today we‚Äôre releasing tota11y ( on GitHub ), an accessibility visualization toolkit that aims to reduce the friction of a11y testing. Inspiration Accessibility is hard for many reasons. While current tooling provides mechanisms for detecting most accessibility violations, there remains a certain amount of disconnect between the developer and the problems they are causing. Most of these errors are things we can‚Äôt see, things that won‚Äôt affect us, and things without a perfect, exact fix . tota11y aims to solve these problems by providing a fun, interactive way to see accessibility issues. Not only should the web be fully accessible to all, but developers should feel empowered to fix and prevent accessibility violations from happening in the first place. A bit of history We‚Äôve been explicitly working to improve the accessibility of Khan Academy since early January. In that time we‚Äôve seen first hand what it takes to go through each and every page on our website and fix things that may prove to be troublesome to assistive technologies. John and I were both very new to this, so we set out and did our research, wrote some tests to detect violations using Chrome‚Äôs Accessibility Developer Tools , and got to work. A few weeks later we had fixed a significant chunk of accessibility errors on our site, and learned an immense amount about assistive technologies. Then the hard part came. We felt capable of fixing most accessibility violations on our site, but how could we spread that knowledge to the team efficiently? How could we make every Khan Academy employee feel empowered to report and fix accessibility violations? We gave talks, wrote docs, sent out emails, but regressions still popped up. Our tests ran, but were flaky, and didn‚Äôt gain the same level of respect as our unit tests or linter. Simply put, our dev team still didn‚Äôt fully understand the problems they were causing, and how to fix them. Meet tota11y About a month ago we set out to build tota11y as an internal project for Khan Academy‚Äôs ‚ÄúWeb Frontend‚Äù team. The aim was to make it as simple as possible for developers to do manual accessibility testing as part of their normal work. Rather than requiring our dev team to dig through long-winded audit reports for violations they didn‚Äôt understand, we wanted provide simple visualizations where they already were ‚Äì the browser, right in front of them. So we started off with the idea of ‚Äúannotations.‚Äù We highlight parts of the current document, either to point out errors, successes, or just to label important tags like headings or ARIA landmarks . A (very) early proof-of-concept for tota11y. We ran with this core idea of ‚Äùannotations‚Äù and expanded it, as you‚Äôll see, to include detailed error messages, suggestions for fixes, and more. What can tota11y do tota11y is a single JavaScript file that you can include in your document like so: <script src=\"tota11y.min.js\"></script> Once you see the glasses in the bottom left corner of your window, you‚Äôre good to go. tota11y currently includes plugins for the following: detecting images with/without alt text (and presentation images) labeling text with contrast violations (and suggesting appropriate color combinations) outlining a document‚Äôs heading structure and pointing out any errors with it highlighting input fields without appropriate labels (and suggesting fixes based on context) labeling all ARIA landmarks on the page detecting unclear link text such as ‚ÄúClick here‚Äù and ‚ÄúMore‚Äù Many of these come directly from Google Chrome‚Äôs Accessibility Developer Tools . Some plugins (like the landmarks plugin) are as simple as labeling parts of the page. Others provide an extended summary of the page, like the headings plugin, using what‚Äôs known as the ‚Äùinfo panel.‚Äù Also using this info panel, we can report errors in more detail and offer suggestions. While we can‚Äôt guarantee to solve all of your accessibility troubles, we think this approach makes violations easier to digest and will inspire developers to think differently about accessibility. What‚Äôs in store? We want to see how others use tota11y, and figure out what other sorts of accessibility violations we can help fix. Some ideas include: proper/improper usage of the ‚Äútabindex‚Äù attribute improper disabling of focus styling buttons that are not keyboard-accessible We also want to continue building a solid API for tota11y, enabling developers to write their own tota11y plugins which may not be included in the original source. And we‚Äôre planning on bundling tota11y as a series of browser extensions to make it easier to test websites without the need to include a script in your application. We hope using tota11y makes you feel empowered to spot, diagnose, and fix accessibility issues on your webpages.

This program gives engineers from non-traditional backgrounds the opportunity to build their experience by working on real products alongside full-time engineers. During my time as a fellow, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with amazing engineers and work on projects that have had immediate impact on Khan Academy‚Äôs users. I was attracted to this role because of my own background working for education nonprofits. The fellowship has given me tangible engineering experience while allowing me to pursue my passion for increasing educational equity for all learners. A few weeks ago, we had our internal Healthy Hackathon where everyone across the company worked on projects related to anything from improving KA products, creating internal tools to make everyone‚Äôs lives easier, creating applications to improve greater society (beyond education), or anything that fosters curiosity, collaboration, and fun. I worked on a project called ‚ÄúRead-to-Me‚Äù that used Mozilla‚Äôs Web Speech API to read widget content  created in Perseus aloud in our Early Learner products. This minor improvement allows young learners who are still building their reading skills to have additional support when completing exercises on our platform. I was excited to work on a project that would better support all early learners regardless of their backgrounds. Many of the gaps in achievement that form between low-income and students of color and their more affluent counterparts begin in early childhood. This project aligned perfectly with my desire to increase equity in education. Additionally, I was able to work with/learn from two experienced engineers and play around with a really cool experimental web technology! I had so much fun working on this project, but it wasn‚Äôt without challenges. Perseus is one of the most complicated parts of our codebase, and it was hard to decide where and how the API should be used in existing code that had a lot of complexity. We didn‚Äôt end up shipping Read-to-Me (it definitely needs a few rounds of code review and some design help), but I am really proud of what we were able to achieve. Through this project, I learned a few lessons that I hope will continue to support me as I continue to grow and reach my fullest potential as a software engineer (and hopefully this will be helpful others too): Endless Curiosity Beats Getting the Answer Right Away: One way that I have learned to persevere through tough spots is by channeling my curiosity about the problem I am trying to tackle. I spent a lot of time looking at Perseus code (probably too much time) figuring out how it works under-the-hood and mapping it back to behaviors I saw in the exercise editor . A lot of it didn‚Äôt make sense, but eventually, I was able to figure out a suitable place in the code to implement the API. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it ended up being enough to help my hackathon team move forward with our project. There‚Äôs a world of technical challenges out there just waiting to be solved. Be open and willing to dive in even if it means going through multiple iterations before reaching a solution. Try it. You‚Äôll Like it: I‚Äôve been very hesitant to try experimental technologies. Because I am early in my career as an engineer, I fall into a trap of wanting to become really good at React or some other established technology before diving into something new. The reality is one could spend a lifetime learning to be really good at something, and engineering is one of those professions where one must constantly learn new things (or even refresh on old concepts). Playing around with the Web Speech API made me more excited to explore other experimental technologies in web development. I learned that as I continue to build upon fundamentals, I should make space for joy, fun and exploration in coding. It‚Äôs Okay to Break Things: A part of learning, growing, and understanding tools/technologies is being in the muck before we have clarity around how something works, where something should go, and how something should be built. Sometimes we don‚Äôt know the path forward, and we still have to be okay with saying, ‚Äúonward‚Äù until a solution crystallizes. When learning, we must break things and experience confusion. I‚Äôm pretty sure I spent most of the hackathon debugging weird error messages as a part of figuring out how Perseus works than I did creating an elegant solution. It was only by breaking something that I was able to figure out how to move forward. This lesson will probably be the most difficult to live out everyday in my work because failure is hard, even for individuals who have a cultivated a growth mindset for a long time. Although, I don‚Äôt intend to take down an entire website for the sake of learning, there‚Äôs something to be said for having the courage to try things even if it means they won‚Äôt necessarily work out. There‚Äôs so much learning in our shortcomings. I hope I have more of these moments because it means I‚Äôm learning and growing not only as an engineer, but also as a human. Who knew I would gain so much from a hackathon! I‚Äôve had an amazing experience so far as a Fellow at Khan Academy, and I hope to carry these lessons and so much more throughout my career.

Kingston is a medium-sized university town on the edge of Lake Ontario that can reach negative 40 degrees with windchill in the winter. (For reference, negative 40 degrees is the point on the temperature scale where Celsius and Fahrenheit overlap with one-another, so basically, it‚Äôs a lot colder than the bay area.) Kingston has a lovely entrepreneurial scene, a strong public sector economy, and a lot of educational and military opportunity. It‚Äôs a beautiful town, and I‚Äôm elated to live here. However, there aren‚Äôt a lot of local places to find a tech job. I‚Äôve worked remotely in some capacity at a few different organizations over the past decade, and worked remotely full-time for approximately two years. My first exposure to remote work was as a graduate student and new parent, when my advisor gave me the chance to experiment with a flexible schedule. Remote work has grown since then. More importantly, we‚Äôve come to understand that remote work isn‚Äôt just as simple as ‚Äúworking from home.‚Äù With growing tool support and broad understanding of what it takes to succeed as a remote employee and as a remote-friendly workplace, towns like Kingston suddenly become just as tech-friendly as San Francisco. Well, San Francisco without the boba, and no bike-delivery in the -40 degree winter. Remote Work and Routine When I started working at Khan Academy, my joke was that I‚Äôd bought some new work outfits to celebrate, including comfortable pajama pants and some soft wool socks. The truth is more complicated. Regular Working Hours Working remotely, whether at home, at a coffee shop/restaurant, or in a co-working space, requires a certain amount of self-discipline. When I was a graduate student and living with a newborn baby, I worked whenever there was time in my schedule (and when I wasn‚Äôt too tired!) Nowadays, it‚Äôs been helpful for me to set up a routine, which is key for getting into the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre at work now‚Äù mindset and not into thinking about all the house tasks that could get done. I‚Äôm used to starting work at eight in the morning because that‚Äôs the time that my wife and kids go to school and the house is empty except for me, my cat, and my fish. A large part of my work schedule revolves around my family life. My work day tends to start right after my kids have hopped on the school bus. I grab lunch at 11 or 12, usually on the hour, and I don‚Äôt eat at my desk. I take a small break at around 3:45 each day to pick up my kids from the bus, hear about how their day went, and get them settled in at home, before returning to work for an hour or so. That‚Äôs what my average weekday looks like. It‚Äôs a comfortable routine that lets me be productive during my best hours while still being available for my family. Knowing When To Stop If you work from home, there‚Äôs a danger in getting trapped in the mindset of always being at work. I have a home office where I spend most of my working time. But I‚Äôm also in here after the kids go to bed to read, to write, or to play a round or two of Spelunky. I‚Äôd be lying if I said I never checked in on Slack to see how things were going in the office. Having a dedicated work space (or mostly dedicated work space) helps me not get trapped in the mindset of always being at work. Sitting on the couch might be comfortable, but it‚Äôs harder for me to feel like I‚Äôm at work because that‚Äôs not where I typically do most of what‚Äôs required of me. If I am on the couch, I can relax because it doesn‚Äôt feel like I have work expectations. Every person is different. It‚Äôs important to be aware of your work-life balance. Setting boundaries helps you stay healthy, while also giving you the time and focus you need to do your work. Important Addendum I did buy the pajama pants and socks! It‚Äôs too cold in the Canadian winter to walk to the bus stop in pajama pants, so I have an unavoidable excuse to get dressed in the morning. Yay, routine! üôÇ Logistical Considerations One of the most striking differences between Khan Academy and my other remote working experiences is that there‚Äôs a visible effort by everybody to be inclusive. Our office is in Mountain View, California. For me (and for the other East Coasters), this means that we have a three-hour difference between the on-site work day. We don‚Äôt have a rigid set of core working hours, and employees are free to work when they‚Äôre able. We try to be mindful of people‚Äôs schedules, of course. This means that teams make a conscious effort to share a few hours of each day for meetings and synchronous conversation. Every meeting room has teleconferencing hardware that‚Äôs easy to use. If there‚Äôs a technical issue that prevents remote employees from taking part, the meeting typically halts until the problem gets solved. Sometimes the solution is creative; when the audio stopped working in a recent meeting, on-site employees banded together to communicate via realtime notes in a shared Google Doc. And when there‚Äôs discussion in or after a meeting, everybody is aware of the small delay when teleconferencing, and patiently waits to make sure they won‚Äôt be speaking over top of somebody else. This mindfulness is the biggest work-related difference that I‚Äôve found here. Khan Academy is always thoughtful of the fact that there are people who work outside of the main office. As an organization, everybody is reflective about communication strategies. We consciously make time for face-to-face meetings. We try to write documentation in a way that enables asynchronous work. And we‚Äôre respectful about the fact that some people are most comfortable working in the early hours of the day while others prefer to start in the late morning and work into the evening. Culture: Treating Remote Employees like Onsite Employees Khan Academy is also mindful of the value of having enough face-to-face time. As employees, we‚Äôre encouraged to travel to Mountain View several times a year, especially at the same time as others. We use Slack to keep in touch, but there‚Äôs no substitute for getting to know people in person. There‚Äôs a long-standing tradition of baking bread . And being at a distance doesn‚Äôt mean that you miss out on the fun benefits of working in an office that supplies you with healthy snacks and other goodies. A delicious banquet of cookies arrived at my front door shortly after starting at KA. My kids even let me have one or two of them. üôÇ Other KA Opinions According to our current company directory, one-third of Khan Academy is remote. I polled our #remote Slack channel where us out-of-towners (and some in-towners) chat about what‚Äôs on our mind and asked two questions: What‚Äôs the best part of working remotely for you, and what‚Äôs the hardest thing about working remotely for you? The most common reason that we get excited about working remotely is the flexible schedule and increased deep-work time. We have a few early-risers, most of whom are farther East than the company office, and those quiet hours in the morning can be some of the most productive. We also appreciate not having to choose between career and family because of where you choose to live. Insofar as establishing a healthy work-life balance, remote work enables us to live in quieter areas, if we choose. Others mentioned the lack of a commute and not having to pay Silicon Valley rent prices. That said, there are other challenges involved in remote work, too‚Äîsome of which are harder to overcome than others. While we do occasionally see each other in-person, remote workers often miss out on the ‚Äúwater-cooler‚Äù culture: the implicit information-sharing and social bonding that happen at the snack station. It‚Äôs difficult to capture those more casual interactions via Hangouts and Slack. Conclusion Khan Academy is a really special place. Everybody here is vested in maintaining a company culture founded on respect and inclusion. As remote employees, we see that reflected in the conscious effort made to keep us as closely informed as on-site employees. And while there are unique challenges that come with working in a separate location from one of the most fun workplaces ever , the tradeoffs make the choice easy. Onward!

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Making thumbnails fast", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/making-thumbnails-fast/", "abstract": "By William Chargin This article has a bit of exposition. The fun stuff starts in ‚ÄúMatrix magic.‚Äù Video thumbnails are a great way to grab users‚Äô attention. YouTube even provides guides for content creators about how to create compelling thumbnails. Until now, however, Khan¬†Academy videos have always used the default YouTube thumbnails‚Äîjust a screenshot of a video frame‚Äîand, given the nature of our content, these are almost always just black rectangles. As part of our content library redesign initiative, we‚Äôre giving thumbnails a higher priority. We decided to enable our content creators to upload custom images and set custom title text for videos, and went through many design iterations before settling on a clean, bold, and eye-catching thumbnail design. Here are two examples: The process for generating those thumbnail images from the source image (which you can see in the background) is as follows: Resize the source image to fill $1280 times 720$¬†pixels. Desaturate the image by¬†$50{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}$. Lighten the image by¬†$50{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}$. Multiply the image with the third-darkest domain color (blue for math, red for science, etc.). Overlay the text and Khan¬†Academy logo. You might be wondering what it means to ‚Äúmultiply‚Äù an image! The color data for each pixel of an image is stored in three components: red, green, and¬†blue (RGB). To multiply two pixels, you multiply the values of their individual components, so $$(r 1, g 1, b 1) cdot (r 2, g 2, b 2) = (r 1 , r 2, g 1 , g 2, b 1 , b 2).$$ For example, yellow¬†$(1, 1, 0)$ multiplied with light cyan¬†$(frac{1}{2}, 1, 1)$ yields greenish-yellow¬†$(frac{1}{2}, 1, 0)$. The qualitative effects of the multiply filter are that black multiplied with anything stays black ($0x = 0$), white multiplied by anything doesn‚Äôt change the original color $(1x = x$), and other colors are tinted to match the multiply color. Performing these kinds of image manipulations efficiently is essentially a solved problem. There are many freely available software toolkits that would be more than sufficient for our needs. However, our server infrastructure doesn‚Äôt allow us to use those libraries, so we ended up implementing these operations ourselves. In the process, we learned a lot about how these operations really work, so we wanted to share that knowledge with you! How could we do this? I¬†had previously written some code to generate simpler thumbnails from a previous design, so I¬†started by updating that code to generate the new thumbnails. The old code used PIL (the Python Imaging Library) for its image operations, because that‚Äôs the only such library supported by App¬†Engine. In cases where PIL lacked functionality or produced unacceptably poor results, I¬†had re-implemented some operations in numpy. All three of the core operations we needed to perform‚Äîdesaturate, lighten, and multiply‚Äîcan be implemented on a per-pixel basis. That is, the output value of a pixel only depends on the original value for that pixel, not on any surrounding pixels (as with, e.g.,¬†a blur). PIL¬†offers the PIL.Image.point(self, fn) function, which applies a given function to every pixel. At first glance, this seems perfect. However, further inspection reveals that this actually transforms each channel individually as well‚Äîthat is, the value for the new red component can‚Äôt depend on the original green or blue. This would only work for lightening; it doesn‚Äôt provide enough information to work for desaturating or multiplying. So, as before, I¬†turned to numpy. I¬†exported the image data to a 3D¬†numpy array (such that arr[x][y] stores channel¬†$c$ of pixel¬†$(x, y)$). After searching the numpy docs, I¬†found the apply_along_axis function, which let me apply a function to each pixel (the ‚Äú$z$¬†axis‚Äù of my 3D¬†array). For example, the following snippet averages the values of each component, so that¬†$(r, g, b)$ becomes¬†$(a, a, a)$, where¬†$a = (r + g + b) / 3$: import numpy as np image = load_original_image(); array = np.asarray(image); transformed = np.apply_along_axis(     lambda px: np.ones(px.shape) * sum(px[:3]) / 3.0),     2,  # z-axis     array) I¬†created a simple function to transform any given pixel, and used apply_along_axis to apply it to the whole image. This approach worked. It also took 35¬†seconds per thumbnail at $1280 times 720$¬†pixels. This was unacceptable. How could we do this better? I¬†profiled the code and determined that only a negligible part was being spent outside of core computations (under¬†$20{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}$). This meant that I¬†wouldn‚Äôt be able to rely on Python-level optimizations to get the kind of speed we needed. So I¬†started browsing the PIL¬†documentation looking for ways to do this at a lower level. The ImageMath , ImageColor , and ImageFilter modules were no help. But then Andy discovered that PIL‚Äôs method for converting between color spaces allows the user to pass an arbitrary transformation matrix as an argument: im.convert(mode, matrix) $Rightarrow$ image Converts an ‚ÄúRGB‚Äù image to ‚ÄúL‚Äù or ‚ÄúRGB‚Äù using a conversion matrix.     The matrix is a 4-¬†or 16-tuple. Initially, I¬†discounted this function because a 16-tuple would require a $4 times 4$¬†transformation matrix, which didn‚Äôt seem appropriate for this use (I¬†expected to use a $3 times 4$¬†affine matrix). But then I¬†looked more closely at the example: rgb2xyz = (     0.412453, 0.357580, 0.180423, 0,     0.212671, 0.715160, 0.072169, 0,     0.019334, 0.119193, 0.950227, 0 ) out = im.convert(\"RGB\", rgb2xyz) The provided matrix was a 12-tuple, exactly as I¬†wanted! So I¬†looked at the PIL¬†source and found, on line¬†767 of imaging.c , if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, \"s(ffffffffffff)\", ...)) {     return NULL; } I‚Äôm no expert on Python‚Äôs C¬†extensions, but there are clearly twelve f s there, and if that‚Äôs anything like the JNI interop, it means that the C¬†code expects Python to pass it a 12-tuple of floats. This agrees with the example, and shows that the documentation is just wrong. ( edit: The Pillow team has since fixed this! The documentation will be correct in new versions of Pillow.) So this was good news! This meant that if I¬†could express all our image manipulation in terms of affine transforms, we‚Äôd be able to use this function. I¬†expected that this would be significantly faster, both because it‚Äôs running in C¬†land and because it just has to perform a matrix multiplication on each pixel, and processors are really good at that. Matrix magic This was the fun part. I¬†needed to figure out what matrix to multiply the pixels by to create the proper transforms. Heads up: This section assumes knowledge of matrix multiplication.   If you want to learn the minimum necessary to proceed, check out our video on matrix‚Äìmatrix multiplication .   If you want to learn more about the underlying theory and why this works, check out our topic about matrix transformations , which discusses linear transformations!   (Affine transformations are extension of linear transformations.) For now, I‚Äôll¬†use the symbol¬†$otimes$ to represent multiplication of affine matrices. Later, we‚Äôll explore how to actually compute this. We need to do three different things to the image: desaturate, whiten, then multiply. Because matrix multiplication is associative, we can tackle these individually. I‚Äôll cover the first one in depth and the other two more quickly. Desaturation Suppose we have a single pixel with color¬†$(r, g, b)$, which we‚Äôll represent as a column vector¬†$begin{bmatrix} r & g & b end{bmatrix}^T$. If you‚Äôre familiar with RGB¬†colors, you‚Äôll know that gray values are all of the form¬†$begin{bmatrix} k & k & k end{bmatrix}^T $ for some¬†$k$; that is, all the components are the same. A simple way to desaturate a color is to take the average of all the components and assign that to each component, as so: $$ begin{bmatrix}     r \\     g \\     b   end{bmatrix}   mapsto   begin{bmatrix}     (r + g + b) / 3 \\     (r + g + b) / 3 \\     (r + g + b) / 3   end{bmatrix}. $$ This is a good start, but it doesn‚Äôt account for the fact that humans perceive green as much brighter than blue. Instead, the standard value for¬†$k$ is given by a weighted average of the three components. That is, $$k = w r r + w g g + w b b$$ for some¬†$w r, w g, and w b$ such that¬†$w r + w g + w b = 1$ (so as not to cause the image to get brighter or darker overall). The standard RGB¬†weights are¬†$w r = 0.299$, $w g = 0.587$, and¬†$w b = 0.114$. So we really want our desaturation transform to work as follows: $$ begin{bmatrix}     r \\     g \\     b   end{bmatrix}   mapsto   begin{bmatrix}     w r r + w g g + w b b \\     w r r + w g g + w b b \\     w r r + w g g + w_b b   end{bmatrix}   =   begin{bmatrix}     0.299 r + 0.587 g + 0.114 b \\     0.299 r + 0.587 g + 0.114 b \\     0.299 r + 0.587 g + 0.114 b   end{bmatrix}. $$ Great. Now we know what we start with and what we want to end up with. At this point, we want to find a matrix¬†$D$ such that $$ D otimes begin{bmatrix}   r \\   g \\   b end{bmatrix} left[ begin{array}{cccc}   d {11} & d {12} & d {13} & d {14} \\   d {21} & d {22} & d {23} & d {24} \\   d {31} & d {32} & d {33} & d {34} end{array} right] otimesbegin{bmatrix}   r \\   g \\   b end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix}   w r r + w g g + w b b \\   w r r + w g g + w b b \\   w r r + w g g + w_b b end{bmatrix}. $$ Let‚Äôs consider the first entry of the target matrix. By the definition of affine matrix transformation, we must have $$d {11} r + d {12} g + d {13} b + d {14} = w r r + w g g + w b b.$$ Because we want this to hold for *all* values of¬†$r$, $g$, and¬†$b$, we can use the classic method of comparing coefficients to see immediately that we must have¬†$d {11} = w r$, $d {12} = w g$, $d {13} = w b$, and¬†$d {14} = 0$ (because there is no constant term on the right-hand side). Similar logic applies to the other two rows, so we see that $$ D = left[ begin{array}{cccc}   w r & w g & w b & 0 \\   w r & w g & w b & 0 \\   w r & w g & w_b & 0 end{array} right].$$ Sweet! But wait‚Äîthe spec said that we only want to partially desaturate the image. So let‚Äôs find a matrix to desaturate a matrix by some factor¬†$k D$. (In particular, the spec lets¬†$k D = 0.5$.) We can do this by linearly interpolating each color component. So if $r 0$¬†is the initial red value and $r 1$¬†is the fully desaturated red value, then $r = (1 ‚Äì k D) r 0 + k D r 1$¬†is the red value desaturated by the factor¬†$k D$. That is, we now want $$ begin{bmatrix}   r \\   g \\   b end{bmatrix} mapsto begin{bmatrix}   (1 ‚Äì k D) r + k D (w r r + w g g + w b b) \\   (1 ‚Äì k D) g + k D (w r r + w g g + w b b) \\   (1 ‚Äì k D) b + k D (w r r + w g g + w b b) end{bmatrix}. $$ Similarly to before, we can create a new matrix¬†$D$, and solve $$ D otimes begin{bmatrix}   r \\   g \\   b end{bmatrix} left[ begin{array}{ccc|c}   d {11} & d {12} & d {13} & d {14} \\   d {21} & d {22} & d {23} & d {24} \\   d {31} & d {32} & d {33} & d {34} end{array} right] otimes begin{bmatrix}   r \\   g \\   b end{bmatrix} $$ $$ begin{bmatrix}   (1 ‚Äì k D) r + k D (w r r + w g g + w b b) \\   (1 ‚Äì k D) g + k D (w r r + w g g + w b b) \\   (1 ‚Äì k D) b + k D (w r r + w g g + w b b) end{bmatrix}. $$ Let‚Äôs look at the first row. The right-hand side expands to¬†$$(k D w r + 1 ‚Äì k D) r + k D w g g + k D w b b,$$ so we see that we must have¬†$$d {11} = k D w r + 1 ‚Äì k D, quad d {12} = k D w g, quad text{and} quad¬†d {13} = k D w b.$$ In the second row, we similarly have¬†$$d {21} = k D w r, quad d {22} = k D w g + 1 ‚Äì k D, quad text{and} quad d {23} = k D w b.$$ Finally, in the third row, we similarly have¬†$$d {31} = k D w r, quad d {32} = k D w g, quad text{and}¬†quad d {33} = k D w b + 1 ‚Äì k D.$$ As before, all the constant terms are zero. Therefore, the new desaturation matrix is $$ D = left[ begin{array}{ccc|c}   k D w r + (1 ‚Äì k D) & k D w g & k D w b & 0 \\   k D w r & k D w g + (1 ‚Äì k D) & k D w b & 0 \\   k D w r & k D w g & k D w b + (1 ‚Äì k D) & 0 end{array} right]. $$ We can write this perhaps a bit more cleanly as $$ D = left[ begin{array}{ccc|c}     k D w r & k D w g & k D w b & 0 \\     k D w r & k D w g & k D w b & 0 \\     k D w r & k D w g & k D w b & 0 end{array} right] + (1 ‚Äì k D) I {34}, $$ if we interpret ‚Äú$I {34}$‚Äù as the identity affine matrix. Some might write this in terms of embedded matrices as $$ D = left[ begin{array}{c|c}   k D vec w & \\   k D vec w & vec 0 \\   k D vec w & end{array} right] + (1 ‚Äì k D) left[ begin{array}{c|c}   I_3 & vec 0 end{array} right]. $$ Lightening We next wanted to lighten the images by some factor¬†$k L = 0.5$. White has a value of¬†$1$, so we can transform some channel¬†$x$ to¬†$k L + (1 ‚Äì k L) x$. Therefore, we want to map $$ begin{bmatrix}   r \\   g \\   b end{bmatrix} mapsto begin{bmatrix}   k L + (1 ‚Äì k L) r \\   k L + (1 ‚Äì k L) g \\   k L + (1 ‚Äì k L) b end{bmatrix}.$$ We can immediately see that the matrix will be diagonal, because none of the components depends on the others. We also see that each component is scaled by a factor¬†$1 ‚Äì k L$, and then a constant factor¬†$k L$ is added. (If you don‚Äôt see this, you can go through the same process as with desaturation to convince yourself.) So the lightening matrix must be $$ L = left[ begin{array}{ccc|c}   1 ‚Äì k L & & & k L \\   & 1 ‚Äì k L & & k L \\   & & 1 ‚Äì k L & k_L end{array} right] left[ begin{array}{c|c}   (1 ‚Äì k L) I 3 & k_L end{array} right]. $$ That wasn‚Äôt too bad at all! Multiplying Finally, we want to multiply our color with some base color¬†$vec c = begin{bmatrix} c r & c g & c b end{bmatrix}^T$. The definition of RGB¬†image multiplication stipulates that we multiply each of three channels individually, so that $$ begin{bmatrix}   r \\   g \\   b end{bmatrix} mapsto begin{bmatrix}   c r r \\   c g g \\   c b b end{bmatrix}. $$ In this case, a full-factor multiply was specified, so we don‚Äôt need to interpolate anything. Therefore, the matrix is diagonal: $$M = left[ begin{array}{ccc|c}   c r & & & 0 \\   & c g & & 0 \\   & & c_b & 0 end{array} right] left[ begin{array}{c|c}   mathrm{diag}  vec c & 0 end{array} right]. $$ Combining the matrices Now that I¬†had the three transformation matrices that I¬†needed, I¬†could have applied transforms three times. But hold on a moment: applying these transforms is just the same as multiplying matrices, which is associative. Suppose that our initial pixel is a column vector¬†$vec p 0$. To desaturate it, we left-multiply by a slightly-modified version of the desaturation matrix, which I‚Äôll denote¬†$D^*$; that is, $vec p 1 = D^* , vec p 0$¬†is the desaturated pixel. Then, we want to lighten this, so¬†$vec p 2 = L^* vec p 1$. Finally, multiplying, $vec p 3 = M^* vec p 2$, and $vec p 3$¬†is our final value. But we can just substitute to show that $$vec p 3 = M^* vec p 2 = M^* (L^* vec p 1) = M^* (L^* (D^* vec p 0)) = (M^* L^* D^*) vec p_0.$$ This shows that we can create a combined transform by just multiplying the matrices in reverse order! By pre-computing that matrix $M^* L^* D^*$, we only have to perform one matrix multiplication (per pixel) instead of three! If you ever wondered why the definition of matrix multiplication seems so convoluted, it‚Äôs because that definition allows awesome things like this to happen. If you‚Äôre following along closely, you might note that the three matrices¬†$M$, $L$, and¬†$D$ are all¬†$3 times 4$ matrices. That poses a problem, because we can‚Äôt multiply them directly. This is where the starred variants come in. If $A$¬†is a $3 times 4$¬†matrix representing an affine transformation, then we can let $$ A^* = begin{bmatrix}   a {11} & a {12} & a {13} & a {14} \\   a {21} & a {22} & a {23} & a {24} \\   a {31} & a {32} & a {33} & a {34} \\   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 end{bmatrix}. $$ I¬†claim that if we also extend the pixel vectors to have an extra $1$¬†entry at the bottom, then these matrices will behave as we desire under multiplication. Let‚Äôs first take a look at just applying such a matrix to make sure it does what we want. Note that $$ begin{array}{rl} A^* vec p &= begin{bmatrix}   a {11} & a {12} & a {13} & a {14} \\   a {21} & a {22} & a {23} & a {24} \\   a {31} & a {32} & a {33} & a {34} \\   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix}   r \\   g \\   b \\   1 end{bmatrix} \\ \\ &= begin{bmatrix}   a {11} r + a {12} g + a {13} b + a {14} (1) \\   a {21} r + a {22} g + a {23} b + a {24} (1) \\   a {31} r + a {32} g + a {33} b + a {34} (1) \\   0r + 0g + 0b + 1(1) end{bmatrix} \\ \\ &= begin{bmatrix}   a {11} r + a {12} g + a {13} b + a {14} \\   a {21} r + a {22} g + a {23} b + a {24} \\   a {31} r + a {32} g + a {33} b + a {34} \\   1 end{bmatrix}, end{array} $$ which is exactly what we expect: the ‚Äúnormal matrix‚Äù part multiplied as normal, the affine components were added as constants, and we even get a $1$ back in the last entry so that we can do this again the next time we multiply! It‚Äôs also not hard to show that the matrices compose as desired, but I‚Äôll omit that here because it involves adding a¬†lot of things and your eyes would just glaze over anyway. It‚Äôll be more meaningful if you do it yourself. In this way, we can create the three original matrices, then their starred variants, then multiply them together to get a single matrix that we can apply to each pixel. Code? Sure! The implementation is a tad different because color values are integers in¬†$mathbb Z cap [0, 256)$ instead of arbitrary reals in the interval¬†$[0, 1]$. But the core idea is the same. Results The time to composite a full-resolution ($1280 times 720$) thumbnail using this method is $25.8,mathrm{ms}$ (on my laptop). The most time-consuming factors for the request are now network overhead, middleware, and RPC¬†calls (e.g.,¬†to load the actual image from Google Cloud Storage). To put that in perspective, it‚Äôs a speedup of over¬†$1350{times}$. This was acceptable. Lessons Don‚Äôt trust the documentation. (The compiler won‚Äôt.) Pay attention in math class (or on Khan¬†Academy if your math class, like mine, didn‚Äôt cover this). For computationally intensive operations, low-level operations are a must.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Khan Academy: a new employee‚Äôs primer", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/khan-academy-a-new-employees-primer/", "abstract": "By Riley Shaw I recently joined the developer team at Khan Academy. Since arriving I‚Äôve been surprised by a number of intentional decisions the organization has made to empower its developers. Whether you‚Äôre working in tech or just curious about the inner workings of Khan Academy, there‚Äôs some great wisdom in how things are done here. All aboard! A benefit of working at an education startup is that everyone naturally puts a lot of thought into information design. As a result, this has been the smoothest onboarding I‚Äôve experienced. Onboarding actually started a few weeks before my first work day. As soon as my offer came through Andy sent me a short message: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre being well taken care of, but if there‚Äôs any questions I can answer for you, or any magic words you need to hear to sign that offer, please send them my way. I said something stupid: As far as magic words go, I‚Äôve always been a fan of ‚Äúflipendo‚Äù ‚Ä¶and I got the coolest response ever: OK!! khanacademy.org/r/flipendo Wat. He‚Ä¶ wat? He made that? For‚Ä¶ me? Wat.[^1] I spent the rest of the weekend pulling out my phone to show people what this wonderful stranger had made. I got a few more messages from the team before starting. A fellow Canadian offered a couch to crash on while I was looking for a place. And I got a message from Jordan , onboarding buddy extraordinaire. Onboarding buddies Starting a new job is intimidating. When you‚Äôre new and have questions it‚Äôs hard to know who to ask, when to ask, and how often to ask. Khan Academy makes this easy by giving every new hire an explicit mentor, along with the following rules: Who to ask: Your mentor. If they don‚Äôt know the answer, they‚Äôll know who knows the answer. When to ask: Now. How often to ask: Probably more often than you currently are. Having someone to relentlessly pester during my first few weeks was instrumental in getting up to speed quickly. One-on-ones As soon as I arrived on my first day I went for a walk with my manager Marcia [^2]. We strolled around the block under the beautiful California sun and learned a bit about each other. She showed me where the nearest coffee shop was. She told me that if I ever had a problem someone would be there to help. It was a warm welcome that set the tone for the rest of the day. When I got back to my desk I scheduled three more walks[^3]. Khan Academy encourages these casual, personal meetings. You frequently see teammates heading outside to talk through a technical decision. Anyone can set up a one-on-one with anyone, and it makes for an open team. TIP A recent-ish experiment at Khan Academy is T eams I nitiatives P rojects, or TIP . It‚Äôs a way of organizing the team across different axes. The gist: Teams represent areas of deep domain expertise like design or mobile. Initiatives are cross-functional major company goals, like ‚ÄúLaunch an SAT guided study program‚Äù. Projects are like mini-initiatives; they‚Äôre scoped at 2-5 weeks and involve 1-3 people. I enjoy working within this framework. Everyone is on a functional team, so even though we‚Äôre spread across different projects we can pool our wisdom and make big decisions. Initiatives let us move toward big targets while projects help scope them down. My favorite part, though, is a side-effect: the support initiative. Support rotations Every three weeks a group of developers enters their scheduled support rotation. On support, you kill bugs. Having a team dedicated to bugs means that everyone else can focus on moving ahead with their projects. New developers at Khan Academy start on support. Every company should do this. In the past I‚Äôve felt guilty for swimming through the codebase at a new job, but on support that was my job! Tracking down bugs was a great way to learn my way around the stack while still contributing. As time went by I grew more confident and started taking on bigger bugs. It was a natural progression and made me confident in my ability to make changes[^4]. Anyone can fix anything At Khan Academy you don‚Äôt need permission to fix things. If you come across some outdated code or CSS rules that are out of order‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all yours[^5]. Be the change that you wish to see in the code. I‚Äôll admit that I was skeptical upon hearing this. ‚ÄúFixing‚Äù a small bug can lead to chaos elsewhere if you‚Äôre not familiar with the system. As such, ‚Äúanyone can fix anything‚Äù might have the corollary ‚Äúanyone can break everything‚Äù. But it works out pretty well when everything is code reviewed! Code reviews Coming from a freelance background, some of my biggest projects were completed in isolation . Working on a team again is exciting because I get to learn from my co-workers. Khan Academy does code reviews for every changed line of code, which is a fantastic way to share tricks and deep contextual knowledge. It also makes deploying less scary. Communication As a growing team ‚Äì especially one that strives to be awesome for our remote members ‚Äì we‚Äôve put a lot of thought into internal communication. We use Hipchat heavily, and try to be transparent with our emails . We have a variety of tools that we use in different contexts, and as a result I have way fewer emails coming through my inbox than I‚Äôm used to. It‚Äôs great. Lunch Khan Academy has delicious catered lunch, which I‚Äôve almost come to expect as a Silicon Valley tech brat[^6]. Something surprising about lunch at KA is that nobody takes their lunch back to their desks. Shortly past noon the office stops typing and shares a meal with one-another. It‚Äôs a pleasant part of the day, and it‚Äôs not usually encouraged as strongly as it is here. Speak now Once a week we‚Äôre treated to a technical talk from someone on our team. These cover a broad range of topics; in my time here I‚Äôve seen talks on functional reactive programming, prototyping as a mindset, mobile architecture, database architecture, and the most ludicrous bug Alan has ever seen. We recently introduced a related series called Demo Now. As our tech-talks gradually became more polished, ad-hoc demos to the entire product team fell by the wayside. Demo Now is an attempt to encourage unrefined demos of cool projects. When everyone is experimenting and pushing their boundaries it‚Äôs important to establish a culture that encourages showing unpolished work. Ship ship ship Our dev setup guide is titled ‚ÄúYour first day: Grok culture and get shipping‚Äù. It guides new engineers through adding themselves to the team page ; many accomplish this on their first day. Strong ongoing mentorship and the support rotation keep the onboarding momentum in full swing. In my first month I owned the development of multiple projects, tackled a big bug, mentored an intern and presented a technical talk to a full room. I‚Äôve done my first (and second and third) proper A/B test, code-reviewed an accessibility project, and volunteered as an assistant at the Learnstorm finals and as a tutor at the Khan Lab School . I even found someone to play music with after work! We achieve so much because we relentlessly focus on action. As Ben writes in Shipping beats perfection explained [^7]: Is this the right philosophy for all products? Absolutely not. But educational content is so badly needed right now, and students are so hungry, that it‚Äôd be vain of us to think satisfying our own hunger for perfection is worth more than students‚Äô needs. We‚Äôll get to the complete mobile app. We‚Äôll get to better coverage of computer programming content. Maybe we‚Äôll even get to a fully immersive physics simulation. One day. If you‚Äôre the type who can‚Äôt ‚Äújust‚Äù leave it better but must make code perfect, then you‚Äôre satisfying your own needs instead of learners‚Äô. You‚Äôre violating ‚Äúshipping beats perfection.‚Äù Open source We‚Äôre committed to open source at Khan Academy[^8]. If it doesn‚Äôt store private or sensitive data, it‚Äôs in an open repo . When we make something extra-useful, we turn it into a standalone library for anyone to use. It‚Äôs cool to work somewhere that loves open source. We‚Äôre receptive to experimenting with new technologies[^9], and splitting our code into modular bits allows us to keep trying new things. We also have all sorts of contributors catching bugs and adding features for us. It‚Äôs useful and inspiring. These are good ideas! Just as code reviews disperse knowledge through a team, tech companies should share their organizational processes. Collaborating as a team of software developers is a yet-unsolved problem, but things get better every day. So take this post as an organizational diff. If something seems healthy, merge it into your own culture and see if it compiles. If you think we‚Äôre missing something, let us know! I‚Äôve personally had a wonderful time getting to know the KA team, and am still as unbelievably excited to be here as I was on day one. Footnotes", "date": "2015-07-20"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "The weekly snippet-server: open-sourced", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/the-weekly-snippet-server-open-sourced/", "abstract": "By Craig Silverstein When I joined Khan Academy, my first project was to write a version of the weekly-snippet server I had worked with at Google . Years later, with the help of many intrepid Khan Academy employees ( one such employee , another such employee , a third such employee , you get the idea ), it‚Äôs ready for the world ! While there are many snippet systems out there, this one is optimized for simplicity (also, free-ness).  For instance, it prefers single webpages with lots of info over paging, queries, or fancy JavaScript.  Filling out a snippet involves writing into a textbox: no fields or text editors or other barriers to productivity.  (Markdown is available for those who want nice formatting.)  This makes it easy to learn and easy to program against. What are weekly snippets? A weekly snippet is an (ideally) brief description of what you did the last week.  What is brief?  The snippet-entry textbox is sized for 4 bullet-point entries, each 80 characters or less: Your snippets are visible to everyone else on your email domain.  (So my snippets are visible to everyone who logs in to KA snippet server with a @khanacademy.org email address.)  Depending on your configuration options, they may also be visible to everyone else on your server. (You may notice, on this page, a bunch of people have not entered snippets.  At Khan, that‚Äôs perfectly ok.  This is a tool for people to use if they find it useful, and ignore if they don‚Äôt.) Why have snippets? Different people might use weekly snippets for different purposes: Instead of a weekly standup or other meeting where everyone shares what they‚Äôve done in the last week, they can just read (and write) snippets. Managers can read snippets of their direct reports to make better use of 1-on-1 meetings. You can look over your own snippets when writing a self-evaluation or applying for a promotion, or when you have any other need to remind yourself what you‚Äôve worked on. I‚Äôve found this last reason is particularly compelling.  I also use snippets as a simple ‚Äútime and motion‚Äù study: when I have too many things to put into snippets one week, I know I‚Äôm being spread too thin! Another benefit of snippets is serendipitous helping: by reading someone‚Äôs snippet, you may discover a task or problem they‚Äôre working on that you can help with, that otherwise you would never have known about. What are snippets not good for? Some people go into a snippet system with unrealistic expectations and are disappointed. Snippets do not work well for large groups, say over 100 people .  If you have 1000 people using your snippet server, it is neither practical nor useful to read through everyone‚Äôs snippets every week. Snippets are, by design, a low level tool: they show you trees but not the forest.  The snippet system does not support ‚Äúrolling up‚Äù groups of snippets or having team-based snippets (though certain individuals could certainly choose to have their own snippets refer to a team‚Äôs progress). Snippets do not provide context.  If you don‚Äôt already know what someone is working on, their snippet may enlighten you, but it will just as likely confuse you. At Khan Academy, the entire company uses one snippet server.  The snippets are divided into various categories, some functional, some project-based.  I like to skim over the snippets for people in unrelated categories such as ‚Äúfacilities‚Äù or ‚Äúrecruiting.‚Äù  I read more closely the snippets in projects I‚Äôm interested in but not working on, such as ‚Äúmobile.‚Äù  And I read most closely the snippets of people in my own project or closely related projects. How do you use the snippet-server? After setting up your settings, to control things like how public your snippets are and whether you want to use plain text or markdown , there are only two web pages: the one where you write your snippets, and the one where you read everyone‚Äôs snippets for a week. The administrator can set up the system to send you reminder emails to write snippets, or to email when snippets are ready for a week.  (The snippet server can also use chat systems for this.) The Google connection The snippet server is built on top of Google AppEngine , and uses Google services for authentication.  To use it, you need to clone the snippet github project and then upload it to your own appengine instance.  (It uses few resources, so Google‚Äôs ‚Äúfree tier‚Äù would work fine.) The people using your snippet server must log in using Google (aka Gmail) accounts.  The snippet server works particularly well with companies that use Google Apps for Work . Email and chat The snippet server integrates with email, HipChat, and Slack. It can send individual emails to people who have not written a snippet for this week, reminding them to do so.  (Users can turn this feature off in their preferences.)  It can also send an email to all registered users, at 5pm on Monday, to say snippets are ready. It can also send reminders and ready messages via chat.  (In this case, the reminder isn‚Äôt [yet] individualized.) Try it out! The Snippet Server has been developed in the open since day one, but it hasn‚Äôt been advertised that well.  Now we‚Äôre looking to change that.  Contributors welcome! We believe that snippets can be a useful tool for a small to medium-sized team, and while there are several snippet server implementations out there, this one‚Äôs ease of use and low low price makes it an appealing alternative.  Try out the server and see what you think.", "date": "2016-02-01"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "What‚Äôs New in OSS at Khan Academy", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/whats-new-in-oss-at-khan-academy/", "abstract": "By Brian Genisio At Khan Academy, we rely heavily on Open Source Software (OSS).  The majority of our software is built upon OSS and we love giving back to the community when we find nuggets of code we think other will find useful. If you‚Äôre ever curious to see what we‚Äôre up to with OSS, take a look at https://khan.github.io .  Some of the most recent additions to that page are highlighted below. Mu Lambda Mu Lambda is a small library of functional programming utilities for JavaScript.  Our front-end codebase is using more and more functional concepts lately and we need some help composing our functions via utilities.  Unfortunately, most of the great OSS options out there today are rather heavy-weight from a payload perspective.  Mu Lambda is 1/10th the size of the popular options out there!  One caveat: it doesn‚Äôt have monad support (which is partially how we reduce the payload size.)  If you want to see it in action, check out the tests . React Balance text React Balance Text is a React wrapper for the Adobe Web Platform‚Äôs Balance-Text project which aims to help eliminate text rags and widows in page copy by making sure the text is as ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù as possible across all lines. Before we built our wrapper, we contributed to their project to help remove the jQuery dependency.  It didn‚Äôt seem prudent to have a React component which relied on jQuery.  In today‚Äôs browser ecosystem, a component like Balance-Text no longer needs anything that jQuery can offer.  We collaborated with Adobe to create version 3.0 of Balance-Text and then wrote a simple wrapper around it for React. The usage is simple and clean: Dispassionate extraterrestrial observer another world, as a patch of light! Extraplanetary! Colonies great turbulent clouds Orion's sword. Venture, circumnavigated vastness is bearable only through love? Tendrils of gossamer clouds quasar cosmos a still more glorious dawn awaits quasar decipherment Drake Equation citizens of distant epochs cosmic ocean consciousness, are creatures of the cosmos not a sunrise but a galaxyrise galaxies, colonies vastness is bearable only through love as a patch of light shores of the cosmic ocean and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions. See the project‚Äôs storybook for more details and use cases. Fuzzy Match Utils Fuzzy Match Utils is a collection of string matching algorithms designed with React Select in mind.  Internally, it uses the Levenshtein distance and longest common subsequence algorithms which employs dynamic programming to measure the difference between two string sequences.  Instead of matching strings literally, it uses a ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù approach.  For example, if you searched for ‚ÄúBay High‚Äù, it will do well to find ‚ÄúBayside High School‚Äù in a list of schools.  We use these utilities in some of our React Select implementations to help the user filter long lists of options more effectively. React Multi-Select Speaking of React Select, React Multi Select is a multiple select component for React (which also uses Fuzzy Match Utils), modeled after the React Select look and feel. React Select is awesome, and we use it a lot, but the way it handles multiple options didn‚Äôt jive with some new user experiences we are working on.  React Select uses a tagging approach where we preferred a dropdown of checkboxes. We wrote React Multi Select to have the same look and feel as React Select, but with a different UX when the user selects the dropdown, specifically designed for the multiple selection use case.  We used the React Component Development Kit which uses React Storybook to help us show use cases.  Because of this, you can demo the component in the project‚Äôs storybook Keeping everything else alive In addition to these new projects, we‚Äôve been keeping our other OSS projects updated as well.  For example, we‚Äôve landed several performance-related updates to Aphrodite thanks to public contributor Joe Lencioni .  In KaTeX , we‚Äôve also incorporated several pull requests from the community.  Check out our OSS page for more projects.", "date": "2017-04-03"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Fun with slope fields, css and react", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/fun-with-slope-fields-css-and-react/", "abstract": "By Marcos Ojeda A while ago, we needed to send out a notification to all our LearnStorm winners inviting them to the Finals event in Mountain View. It‚Äôs a big deal! Only 200 Students from all of the bay area got invited to the event. Because most (if not all) of them were under 13, we couldn‚Äôt email[^coppa] them so we needed to make something that would catch their eye the next time they visited the website. And, as with the most fun projects, there was very little time to actually work on this: from start to finish, this was bounded to around three days, so in terms of design, it would need to be nice, but it couldn‚Äôt be 100{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} totally new shiny design work: compromises would need to be made. step one: notifications You have probably gotten a notification on Khan Academy before, and readily dismissed it like so much purple rain.[^purplerain] And why not, it‚Äôs certainly‚Ä¶ distinctive , but that purple rectangle is not exactly injecting anybody‚Äôs retinas with ‚Äúnotification delight,‚Äù so step one was figuring out how to make the notifications look nicer. step two: learnstorm? The next step of research was teasing apart learnstorm‚Äôs visual style: the slope field motif is the heart of learnstorm‚Äôs identity.[^sloperefresh] In making this notification banner I knew that I wanted echo the identity, but from another angle or perspective. To do that I would need to grok that slope field a little better because already at this point, i knew i wanted to incorporate it into the banner in some way. But wait a second‚Ä¶ math??? we can‚Äôt even center a div , how can we possibly do anything with slope fields? Actually, let‚Äôs step back even further‚Ä¶ differential equations? what‚Äôs a slope field again? step yak: a math detour My thinking went: our contest is rooted in differential equations, it‚Äôll probably help to revisit them. [^1803revisited] And after a brief while you find that a slope field is basically what it claims to be: the slope of a differential equation calculated at periodic points on a plane. And differential equations only express the feel of an equation, not exactly what it looks like because they‚Äôre missing several constant values. So for a plain ol‚Äô circle y^2 + x^2 = 1 , you‚Äôd get y‚Äô = -x/y + c (which you could find via implicit differentiation ), but again‚Äô all that‚Äôs saying is that the slope for this differential equation at any point is the x value divided by the y value times negative one plus some arbitrary c (which, for us, we‚Äôll just pretend is zero). For whatever point, you just enter x and y into that equation and that‚Äôs the slope. [^slopedetour] neat! But when we attempt to draw this (say on paper or digitally), we don‚Äôt actually want y‚Äô , we want whatever direction y‚Äô corresponds to so we can point a triangle in that direction. With a simple equation like y‚Äô = -x / y , we run into this problem where for zeroey y values we have infinitely positive or negative y‚Äô and what do you do with that? Well, Math to the rescue! Specifically the standard atan2 method which returns the angle in radians (from the origin) for the point at (x,y) . It‚Äôs a special function which calculates the arctangent but is smart enough to compensate for zero denominators in pretty much the same way you would.[^divzero] Looking at the atan2 implementation, you find that it does the kind of ‚Äúintuitive limit-ey division‚Äù that you‚Äôre often asked to do in the first weeks of a calc class. Instead of NaN you get ¬±œÄ/2 and instead of 0 you get 0 or œÄ. It‚Äôs great! And it‚Äôs exactly what we need. For a given (x,y) pair, you get a corresponding radian value. Also, recall, we have a diff eq that is given by y‚Äô = -x/y , we can use atan2 to find the slope of each point on the plane.[^atan2deets] Ok, we know how we might use this, now we just need to get started actually drawing it. step two: prototyping The first step of prototyping this was a small python script that i wrote for PlotDevice [^plod] Again, remember that i didn‚Äôt have too much time to work on this project, I needed to be certain that I could fake out a new spin on learnstorm identity so if I began to run out of time, I could, at the very least, render a cute static image as the background for the banner. Well, this looks promising! But the day is young: could i‚Ä¶ animate this? Stepping back, let‚Äôs do a small crit[^crytime] here: part of what makes the learnstorm identity cool is that you get this round vibe even though everything is stuck on a grid. Breaking the grid in this case would not only require me animating each dart but animating them along circular paths which, i mean, would look awesome but‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶ maybe let‚Äôs save that for LearnStorm 2016 when we have more time‚Ä¶ Also, let‚Äôs take this moment to visibly and vocally Pivot .[^sandhillfootnote] Because i spent the morning trying to figure out how to procedurally draw slope fields, i already have (a sort of) infrastructure for generating slope fields, but the problem is that i want something i can easily animate. Time for a new differential equation! Maybe we can just make something up, something‚Ä¶ real easyish, like‚Ä¶ y‚Äô = x + y and if you plot this out correctly, you end up seeing something like this: but say you make a mistake[^herpderp] and remove that super ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù atan2 we just learned about, you get something‚Ä¶ novel. What‚Äôs happening is that if you pick a row or a column, you find that the rotation values are monotonically increasing but at a slightly different starting point and because the atan2 isn‚Äôt around, the darts just continue rotating and rotating‚Ä¶ Ok, so now we have a moderately intriguing slope field which, let‚Äôs be honest, is something of an accidental slope field at the moment. So, back to our project: how do we animate it? Well, the neat thing again is that if you walk along the y axis (or x axis) every dart rotates however much you moved. So let‚Äôs say you start with that static image above and, for each point, you increase y or x in that y‚Äô = x + y by a little without actually moving the point, they all appear to rotate just a little bit more counterclockwise, like so: Which is great and hypnotic. But how do we incorporate this into the announcement banner? My first instinct was animated gif: but the gifs ended up being multi-megabyte monstrosities and movies no better. Even the gyfcat embed up a few paragraphs ago is, at worst, 4M and, at best, a 400k webp movie. and the quality‚Ä¶ i mean, you have eyes, just look at it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs let‚Äôs just say, not the best. Ugh, this is not a very complicated thing! it‚Äôs just a bunch of triangles rotating round and round and‚Ä¶ wait a minute Instead of actually rendering some background image and scaling it up, why not do the animation in the browser using a technique you may have heard of called Dynamic HTML .[^dhtml] staggering animations Here‚Äôs how I would roughly do it: i would use a single dart image, lay out a bunch of them on a grid and then rotate them with css. At first i thought I can set each dart‚Äôs from-rotation and it‚Äôs to-rotation dynamically! And i would use css to start each dart‚Äôs animation at, say, some radian value, setup a keyframe animation to rotate 2œÄ radians over some fixed time scale and then call it a day. Genius! But because[^pleasemaildan] there‚Äôs no easy way to create a parameterized css animation with arbitrary start/end points and because it felt wasteful to specify a new animation starting at some radian value going a full 2œÄ for all radian values, i instead opted for a more, shall we say, lo-fi approach. Instead, each dart would use the exact-same 2œÄ rotation animation , but to stagger the animations, I would set each dart‚Äôs animation delay to achieve the same effect. Then, I would set this field of spinning darts on a z-index below an actual html notification. implementing this My first attempt did something comical: because i had already generated the animation above using plotdevice as part of my testing, i already had a series of timing offsets along with x/y positions so i printed the starting rotation for each dart and saved that as a json array which i loaded directly into a very small react template yielding something approximately like the ‚Äú`javascript // a massive array of rotation offsets var dartRot = [0, 0.234, 0.469,               ‚Ä¶, a few megabytes more, ‚Ä¶]; for (var i=0; i < dartRot.length; i += 1){   style = { animationDelay: dartRot[i], ..., };   return ; } ‚Äú` I iterated over all the values and then used that to set the animation delay. My goodness! how ridiculous! That‚Äôs basically as bad as writing out all those css animations one-by-one. But i mean, the takeaway was that the idea was not bad even if my initial implementation was. Instead, I set down the project for the day and it took until the next morning to realize that i could do something much less ridiculous: javascript for (var x=0; x < dartCols; x += 1){   for (var y=0; y < dartRows; y += 1){     // what's that... a... *computed* delay?!     style = { animationDelay: (x+y), ..., };     return ;   } } This wasn‚Äôt even that much more work, i had already done much of it in python,  i just needed to translate it! Here‚Äôs basically a demo of that react implementation.[^democaveat] JS Bin on jsbin.com The nice thing here is that not only is the code not packed with magic arrays, it‚Äôs also wayyyyyy more obvious what‚Äôs going on. Even setting the x/y positions ( not shown ) in the style object is more obvious and the code you end up with allows you to think in terms of a unit grid but render elements by twiddling the knobs of your various scale factors. Because the animation works by setting an animation delay, it slowly staggers into being. So when the banner appears, everything starts off pointing to one direction only to eventually fall in line at some point along the animation delay. At Khan Academy, we have a neat tool to let you prototype a react component in the context of the site called the React Sandbox. It works on the local dev server and lets you get a quick jsbin/fiddle environment but with all the goodies you‚Äôve come to expect on the site. Using it, you get something like this: The design isn‚Äôt super mind blowing: it‚Äôs a spin on the regular learnstorm header, but it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ alive ! And, more importantly, it transfers the gravity of the original learnstorm header into celebrating the accomplishments of our regional winners and brings the identity to life even if it doesn‚Äôt directly animate the circular slope field. lessons learned Well, aside from the fact that it‚Äôs fun to use math to make cool notifications, the main lesson (i think), is that by thinking about prototyping (and parametrizing) early on, you can come up with interesting ways of procedurally generating animations later on even when your environment (like css) is constrained. Part of this was definitely baked into the early differential equation investigations. Later this was teased out using python and in the end, even though the animation was implemented using react, the various explorations let me realize that this is the sort of thing that you could implement with anything else like d3 or even good ol‚Äô jQuery or handlebars. In the end, somebody who had received the notification by visiting the site would see this (except animating): If you saw the notification, congrats on participating in learnstorm! It was great fun making something for you üôÇ", "date": "2015-08-05"},

In particular, Christopher ‚Äúvjeux‚Äù Chedeau sparked much of this discussion in his talk React: CSS in JS . Instead, I‚Äôd like to discuss Aphrodite , the inline styling solution we‚Äôve developed at Khan Academy, the constraints that led to it, and its use in production today. Page weight and server-side rendering As part of an initiative to speed up Khan Academy‚Äôs core content pages, we identified that the most important predictor of page load speed was the number of bytes needed before the content was rendered. From testing different bandwidth limitations and network latencies, we found that bandwidth was a bigger predictor of page speed, not latency. You can verify this yourself by trying loading various sites and using custom networking throttling profiles in the Chrome Developer tools. So cutting bytes was our goal. To meet that goal, we opted to pursue server-side rendering. If you‚Äôre unconvinced that server-side rendering yields a fast page load, here‚Äôs a simple argument. We‚Äôll focus on initial page load, before any of your static assets are cached. Assume all the sizes mentioned here are measured after gzip. Let M be the byte size of the minimal HTML markup required to load your website, including script tags to load whatever client-side libraries you want. Let J be the byte size of the JavaScript needed to render your page (e.g. React + other libraries + the JavaScript UI components). Let S be the byte size of the server-side rendered markup for your page. This  would be the contents of the . Let C be the byte size of the CSS needed to render the components on the page. Now let‚Äôs examine how many bytes the client has to download before the user can see the content on the page. In the server-side rendered case, it‚Äôs M + S + C. In the client-side rendered case, it‚Äôs M + J + C. So if you agree with the hypothesis that fewer bytes means a faster site, then if J > S, server-side rendering will be faster. The production build of React alone is 43KB after gzip, so if you can get your server-side rendered content markup below that, server-side rendering will get content to your users faster. You can read posts arriving at similar conclusions from Tom Dale of Ember , Dan Webb of Twitter , Spike Brehm of Airbnb , and Turadg Aleahmad of Coursera . Constraints So let‚Äôs return to the problem of CSS. Given a goal of reducing bytes until content was visible, we set forth to find a CSS solution that allowed us to colocate our CSS with our React components with the following constraints: We must be able to extract and deliver the CSS needed by our components when the component was server-side rendered. When the client-side re-renders the components in React to make them fully interactive, the page must not dramatically change. This meant correctly handling media queries, pseudo-selectors such as :hover and :visited all in CSS, and not via JavaScript-bound events. ( :visited can‚Äôt be implemented in JavaScript anyway ). This disqualifies libraries such as Radium which use component state to emulate :hover. We must deliver the absolute minimum amount of CSS necessary by only sending down CSS in use by components in the server-side rendered body. This rules out extracting all the CSS used in all of our components at compilation time, as much of that CSS would not be needed for the initial page load. As to avoid increasing the time to the site being fully interactive, any runtime added must be small (< 10KB after gzip). Unsatisfied with the existing options*, Emily Eisenberg and I wrote Aphrodite to satisfy these constraints. Our primary use case is use with React components, so all of the examples that follow will be in React, though it‚Äôs worth mentioning that Aphrodite does not depend on React in any way. *: React Look has since come a long way. It is in many ways more featureful, though is a larger library to send over the wire. Many of the ideas appear to be quite similar. It also has support for React Native, which Aphrodite does not. React Look, as the name suggests, is coupled to React, which Aphrodite is not. If Aphrodite doesn‚Äôt interest you, check out Look. A simple example Here‚Äôs how Aphrodite works. First, styles are defined via a syntax inspired by React Native‚Äôs StyleSheet , like so: ‚Äú` const styles = StyleSheet.create({     red: {         backgroundColor: ‚Äòred‚Äô     },     blue: {         backgroundColor: ‚Äòblue‚Äô }, hover: {     ':hover': {         backgroundColor: 'red'     } }, small: {     '@media (max-width: 600px)': {         backgroundColor: 'red'      } } }); ‚Äú` This, by itself, does not generate any CSS. CSS is only injected into the of the page when these classes are used . The injection happens in Aphrodite‚Äôs css() function. Here‚Äôs an example of using css() in a React component: class App extends Component {     render() {         return This is red. This turns red on hover. This turns red when the browser is less than 600px width. This is blue. This is blue and turns red when the browser is less than                 600px width. ;     } } Only once this component is rendered will the CSS be injected into the page. The css function generates CSS to inject into the page and returns an associated CSS class name. On the client-side, it will automatically inject the CSS into the of the page. On the server-side, it will buffer the CSS to be flushed as one big string into the HTML response. Let‚Äôs look at a simple case: This is red. The injected CSS for this span looks like this: .red_im3wl1{color:red !important;} And the span ends up looking like this in the DOM: This should be red Avoiding class name collisions You may be wondering where the _im3wl1 comes from. Imagine we had two components, that each define a class with the style name red, like so: ‚Äú` const Component1 = () => 1 ; const styles1 = StyleSheet.create({     red: {         backgroundColor: ‚Äòred‚Äô     } }); const Component2 = () => 2 ; const styles2 = StyleSheet.create({     red: {         backgroundColor: ‚Äò#cc1100‚Äô     } }); ‚Äú` It would be surprising behaviour if either one of those ended up using the other‚Äôs style, so we need some way to differentiate between them. We initially solved this by appending a random number to the class name. This works great‚Ä¶ unless you want server-side rendering to work well. Deterministic rendering and data-react-checksum When you render a component server-side via ReactDOMServer.renderToString, out outputs HTML that might look something like this: ‚Äú` ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú`  From working with React keys, you‚Äôve likely seen `data-reactid` before, but  what‚Äôs this `data-react-checksum` business?   When your re-render your React component on the client-side to bind all your  events and run the lifecycle starting with `componentDidMount`,  `ReactDOM.render` will construct a virtual DOM using your component. It then takes a checksum of  that component tree and compares it with the one emitted by  `ReactDOMServer.renderToString`. If it‚Äôs identical it will re-use the  server-rendered DOM tree and avoid needing to reflow the page or do any style  recalculations. If it‚Äôs different, it will replace the entire DOM tree.  This is not so great for performance, so we‚Äôd like to avoid that.  If we generate random numbers that wind up in the HTML output of our component, then the checksum certainly won‚Äôt match. So we can‚Äôt use random numbers, but we still need something to avoid name collisions.  We could use a simple global counter, but when would we reset that counter? Each time we render? If we do that, then we might still get name collisions between classes generated by two separate render calls.  What we really want is a 1:1 mapping between the class name and the style declarations associated with that class name. Sounds like a job for hashing!  We take a hash of the JSON stringified style declaration and use that as a suffix. On recommendation from our Dean of Infrastructure, Craig Silverstein, we used [MurmurHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash).  It is possible that two components will each declare their own copy of styles with the same name and the same contents, like so:  ‚Äú` const Component1 = () => 1 const styles1 = StyleSheet.create({     red: {         backgroundColor: ‚Äòred‚Äô     } });  const Component2 = () => 2 const styles2 = StyleSheet.create({     red: {         backgroundColor: ‚Äòred‚Äô     } }); ‚Äú`  In this case, we get a class name collision on `red_im3wl1`, but that‚Äôs okay,  because they reference the exact same properties and values, so there‚Äôs no  surprising behaviour!  ## Deterministic precedence  It‚Äôs a common desire to apply styles from multiple CSS classes to a single element, perhaps applying some conditionally.  ‚Äú` const Component = () => You only have to know one thing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ You can learn anything! const styles = StyleSheet.create({     bold: {         fontWeight: ‚Äòbold‚Äô,         color: ‚Äòblack‚Äô     },     awesome: {         Color: ‚Äògreen‚Äô     } }); ‚Äú` If we take the naive approach and generate two classes for the second span and attach them both as the class name, we end up in this situation: ‚Äú` The only thing you need to know is‚Ä¶ You can learn anything! ‚Äú` In a stylesheet, where there are two styles defined with equal specificity, the one that comes later in the stylesheet has precedence. In a hand-tuned stylesheet that can be confusing, but in an auto-generated one it can be disastrous! The intent here was for ‚ÄúYou can learn anything‚Äù to appear bold and green, but because bold was injected into CSS after awesome, the second text ends up being black! This is somewhat surprising behaviour, but it gets worse. Imagine updating the component and change it to this: const Component = () => Nobody starts knowing everything. The only thing you need to know is... You can learn anything! Because styles.bold is passed to css() first, it gets injected first. ‚Äú` Nobody starts knowing everything. The only thing you need to know is‚Ä¶ You can learn anything! ‚Äú` This changes the order of the declarations, which changes the styling on ‚ÄúYou can learn anything!‚Äù. The order of calls to css affecting which style rules get applied is certainly surprising behaviour that we‚Äôd like to avoid. Our solution in Aphrodite is to always generate a single class name, and handle the precedence in JavaScript instead of letting the browser decide. The result we generate looks like this: ‚Äú` Nobody starts knowing everything. The only thing you need to know is‚Ä¶ You can learn anything! ‚Äú` This can generate larger CSS, however it‚Äôs not quite a combinatorial explosion. Remember that we inject only the CSS that actually gets used, so if we only ever used bold with awesome, we wouldn‚Äôt generate CSS for exclusively using bold. Our first example exploring precedence order would come out like this: ‚Äú` The only thing you need to know is‚Ä¶ You can learn anything! ‚Äú` In production! Newly written React components at Khan Academy use Aphrodite for their styling needs. If you visit khanacademy.org/science/physics and view source, you should see something like this: This is red. This turns red on hover. This turns red when the browser is less than 600px width. This is blue. This is blue and turns red when the browser is less than                 600px width. ‚Ä¶ You only have to know one thing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ You can learn anything! The only thing you need to know is‚Ä¶ You can learn anything! Nobody starts knowing everything. The only thing you need to know is... You can learn anything! Nobody starts knowing everything. The only thing you need to know is‚Ä¶ You can learn anything! Nobody starts knowing everything. The only thing you need to know is‚Ä¶ You can learn anything! The only thing you need to know is‚Ä¶ You can learn anything!", "date": "2016-03-29"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Forgo JS packaging? Not so fast", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/forgo-js-packaging-not-so-fast/", "abstract": "By Craig Silverstein Bundling JavaScript files The traditional advice for web developers is to bundle the JavaScript files used by their webpages into one or (at most) a few ‚Äúpackages.‚Äù Multiple tools have been developed to do this, such as Browserify and Webpack . They tend to work like this: for a given HTML page, you write a single JavaScript source file that provides all the JS logic needed for that page. You then use a bundler to create a package that includes that JavaScript source file plus all its dependencies; that package is then served via a single HTTP request. The opposite of bundling is to just serve all those JavaScript source files separately: your HTML page has a <script> tag for your ‚Äúmain‚Äù JS source file, but before that it has <script> tags for each of its dependencies as well. There is also a middle ground ‚Äî this is what Khan Academy does ‚Äî of bundling together JavaScript source files into packages, but into a small number of semantically related packages, rather than a single package per HTML page. There are reasons in favor of each of these approaches: Approach Pros Cons Package per page No unused files Only 1 HTTP request Poor caching Separate JS files No unused files Optimal caching Many HTTP requests Limited parallelism Hybrid Few HTTP requests OK caching Some unused files OK caching Basically, the package-per-page approach gives up cacheability in favor of minimizing HTTP requests: if you visit a second page on the same website, you‚Äôll have to download a whole new JavaScript package, even though it includes many of the same dependencies as the old page. If it sticks in your craw that your users have to re-download jQuery every time they click on a new page on your site, per-page packages are not for you. But if you don‚Äôt do any packaging at all, while cacheability is excellent, your HTTP performance goes down the tubes; if your page requires dozens of JavaScript source files, you have to download each separately, paying HTTP (plus maybe SSL) overhead each time. Plus, most browsers limit the number of simultaneous fetches they‚Äôll do, meaning these downloads can‚Äôt even all happen in parallel. This ends up being very slow. Khan Academy uses a hybrid approach: we combine JavaScript source files into packages, but we do so based on what files are used together. So we have one package that has JavaScript specific to video pages, and another specific to our CS content, and another specific to internationalization, and so forth. A given HTML page will need several such packages, and often will need only some of the source files in each package. On a given page, you waste time downloading extra bytes for unused JavaScript source files, but hopefully save time due to some packages being cached in the browser. HTTP/2.0 changes the calculus‚Ä¶or does it? HTTP/2.0 (and its predecessor SPDY) changes all the considerations here. HTTP/2.0 has advanced flow control techniques like multiplexing. This means that you can use a single connection to download dozens of JavaScript files, and download them all in parallel. Suddenly the ‚Äúcons‚Äù column of the ‚Äúseparate JS files‚Äù approach empties out. As more and more browsers support HTTP/2.0 ( over 60% of all browsers worldwide), you‚Äôd expect there to be a groundswell of support for leaving JavaScript packaging behind and moving to just serving JavaScript source files directly. And indeed, there is a mini-groundswell , at least. Khan Academy spent several months rearchitecting its system to move from a package-based scheme to one that just served JavaScript source files directly, at least for clients that support HTTP/2.0. And here‚Äôs what we found: Performance got worse. On investigation we found out there were two reasons for this: We were serving more bytes due to reduced compression quality The server had unexplained delays serving dozens of JS files The sections below explore these issues in more detail. Our conclusion is it is premature to give up on bundling JavaScript files at this time, even for HTTP/2.0 clients. In particular, bundling into packages will continue to perform better than serving individual JavaScript source files until HTTP/2 has a better story around compression. Bundling improves compression All modern servers and browsers compress (most) data being sent over the wire, typically using the zlib DEFLATE algorithm (colloquially, ‚Äúzlib‚Äù). This results in major time savings: for one Khan Academy HTML page, the associated JavaScript content is 2,421,176 bytes uncompressed, but only (!) 646,806 bytes compressed, or about a quarter the size. When we changed that page to download JavaScript source files individually rather than as packages, the uncompressed size went down to 2,282,839 bytes (a nice 5% savings). This is because we could omit JavaScript files that were not actually needed on this page, but were included in one of the required packages regardless. But the compressed size went up , to 662,754 bytes! Size Packages Individual files Pct difference uncompressed JS 2,421,176 bytes 2,282,839 bytes -5.7% compressed JS 646,806 bytes 662,754 bytes +2.5% number of files 28 files 296 files (+921%) On reflection, this is no surprise: due to how zlib operates, using a sliding window of previous text to guide its compression, it does much better on big files than small ones. In particular, it will always compress 100 1K files worse (in aggregate) than the single 100K file you get by concatenating them all together. (More details: at a high level, zlib compresses like this: it goes through a document, and for every sequence of text it‚Äôs looking at, it sees if that text had occurred previously in the document. If so, it replaces that sequence of text by a (space-efficient) pointer to that previous occurrence. It stands to reason that the further along in the document it goes, the more ‚Äúprevious text‚Äù there is for finding a potential match and thus an opportunity for compression. This discussion omits some details, like the limited size of the sliding window, that do not affect the overall conclusion. For more details on zlib, and the LZ77 algorithm it implements, see Wikipedia .) zlib actually has a mechanism built in for improving compression in the case of many small files: you can specify a ‚Äúpreset dictionary‚Äù , which is just a big string of bytes. Basically, when compressing with a preset dictionary, you can replace text either with a pointer to earlier in the document, or into the preset dictionary. With a preset dictionary, early parts of the document have more opportunities to find a good pointer match. HTTP/2 actually takes advantage of this feature by hard-coding a preset dictionary that servers and browsers must use when talking HTTP/2. Unfortunately for us, that preset dictionary has text related to HTTP headers, and is useless at improving the compression quality of JavaScript files. Preset dictionaries are hard to use as part of HTTP because both the server and client must agree on the contents of the preset dictionary or the data will get corrupted. HTTP/2 solves this problem by hard-coding a single value in both places. For our application, though, of improving compression of many JavaScript files, there would have to be some way for the server to communicate the preset dictionary to the client. This takes time, of course, and really only works well if it‚Äôs supported at the protocol layer. That said, for cases like this it would be a significant net win overall. But it likely wouldn‚Äôt be easy to augment the HTTP/2 spec to allow for something like this in a safe way! HTTP/2.0 has service issues In addition to increasing bandwidth, moving away from packages increased latency due to sub-optimal behavior of our webserver when serving hundreds of JavaScript source files. Our analysis of this behavior was not entirely satisfactory, since we do not control our webserver (we use Google App Engine). However, by analyzing HAR files we could see the effect plainly: Not all the JavaScript files are requested at the same time, there‚Äôs a small gap between requesting each one. About halfway down the image (you can click on it to see this more clearly), there is a large gap. Those files also require over a second to download, though it‚Äôs difficult to tell exactly what‚Äôs going on due to HTTP/2 multiplexing. But clearly something is not as efficient as it could be. These tests were done on a recent Chrome browser. It‚Äôs possible other browsers would have different effects. And the test was emulating a super-fast FiOS connection; you can see that all the time is taken in the green part of the bars (time to first byte) and not the blue part (time to download the full file). Furthermore, reloading the page gave HAR files looking substantially different each time. But the end result was the same: a page that had much more latency than when using packages. When we stuck with a relatively small number of packages, the waterfall was consistent and reliable (and much shorter!): The time-to-first byte is still longer than we would like, for reasons we are not entirely sure of, but it‚Äôs much more consistent than in the individual-source-file case! (If you are curious, entry #7, with the longest blue bar, is for our ‚Äòcore‚Äô JavaScript package which includes jQuery, React, and a few other large, rarely-changing libraries. For our test, we disabled the browser cache, but our hope is most of our users will need to download that package only once, getting the contents from their browser cache after that.) It‚Äôs all about the bytes It may not have escaped your notice that 662,754 bytes is a lot of bytes for JavaScript for a single HTML page, and 296 files is a lot of files. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing on that page?‚Äù you may well be wondering. We are wondering that too. The page in question is the Khan Academy homepage for logged in users, and its acquired a lot of, um, functionality over the years. The end result of our analysis is that our page isn‚Äôt going to load any faster until we reduce the amount of JavaScript we use on the page. Tricks like trying to load a bunch of stuff in parallel, or aggressive caching, might seem like appealing shortcuts, but nothing replaces just auditing the code and making it need less ‚Äústuff.‚Äù Summary HTTP/2.0, with its multiplexing, header compression, and the like, offers the promise of the best of all worlds when it comes to downloading JavaScript: great local caching, great download efficiency, no wasted bytes, and a simpler serving infrastructure to boot. All you have to do is give up your packaging system and download all your JavaScript source files individually. The reality is not so rosy. Due to degraded compression performance, the size of the data download with individual source files ends up being higher than with packages, despite having achieved ‚Äòno wasted bytes‚Äô. Likewise, the promised download efficiency has yet to show up in the wild, at least for us. It seems that, for the moment at least, JavaScript packaging is here to stay.", "date": "2015-11-23"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Let‚Äôs Reduce! A Gentle Introduction to Javascript‚Äôs Reduce Method", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/lets-reduce-a-gentle-introduction-to-javascripts-reduce-method/", "abstract": "By Josh Comeau Every summer, Khan Academy recruits a few software engineer interns. As part of their onboarding, we host several brief talks introducing the technology we work with: React, Flow, Google AppEngine, and so on. I volunteered to introduce Redux , a tool to manage front-end state. For this reason, I found myself looking at how Redux is taught. There are a lot of great resources for learning Redux, but few of them cover the fundamental knowledge you need to fully understand it. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that to understand Redux, you first need to understand Array.prototype.reduce . reduce is an array method, similar in spirit to map and filter , but far more flexible. Like those other methods, reduce is called on every item in the list, but the end result can be whatever you need; an array of data, an object, a number. That flexibility comes at a price, though: it‚Äôs pretty tough to get the hang of. Unlike those other array methods, each iteration in reduce is affected by the previous iteration‚Äôs return value. Similar to recursion, you need to be able to keep track of the sequence of iterations in your head, and this can be a hard skill to develop. It‚Äôs like building muscle memory; it takes a while for it to become intuitive and natural. I had initially set out to write a blog post introducing Redux, but reduce warrants a blog post of its own. It‚Äôs foundational to understanding Redux, and it‚Äôs also a really neat tool to have in your toolbelt. Prerequisite Knowledge: I‚Äôll be assuming you have an understanding of modern JavaScript, including arrow functions , enhanced object literals , and the array spread operator . It‚Äôs probably also helpful if you know about Array.prototype.map and Array.prototype.filter . Once you‚Äôve gotten that stuff down, come on back. Some Words That Probably Won‚Äôt¬†Help Every explanation I‚Äôve seen for reduce tries to explain how it works using English. The problem is, it‚Äôs a bit like trying to learn how to tie a shoelace using words alone; you may be able to understand intellectually how it works‚Ä¶ but good luck keeping your shoes on. I expect that the ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moment will come further on, when looking at a visualization of how it works, or trying the problem exercises for yourself. Nevertheless, I think it‚Äôs worthwhile to have these ideas grasped loosely in your mind, the soil from which understanding will grow. First, a definition: reduce is a way of deriving a single result from a series of¬†values. A suitable analogy is assembling a layer cake. We start with a bunch of layers, and each layer needs to be frosted and assembled, producing a single cake at the end. Summing Values The most common example for explaining reduce is using it to sum an array of numbers. Say you have the following data, and you want to calculate the total: js const arr = [3, 5, 1, 4, 2]; reduce allows you to take this array of numbers, and compute a single result (in this case, the number 15). There are, of course, many ways of solving this problem. Here‚Äôs an example that uses a forEach loop: ‚Äú`js let total = 0; arr.forEach((item) => {   total += item; }); ‚Äú` In this solution, we iterate through our list, adding each value to a variable kept in the parent state. reduce works in a similar way, but doesn‚Äôt involve mutating an outside variable. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôd do it: ‚Äú`js const arr = [3, 5, 1, 4, 2]; const total = arr.reduce((acc, item) => {   return acc + item; }, 0); ‚Äú` Right away, we can see that there are some similarities; you call it on an array, and then it calls a provided callback function on every item in that array. reduce takes two arguments: the callback function , called once for every item in the array. This callback takes a parameter that we‚Äôll call acc (short for accumulator ; this name will make sense soon), and the item itself. an initial value . That initial value becomes the first argument supplied to the callback as acc . Our initial value is set to be 0 , and the first item in our array is 3 , so on the first iteration, our function body populates to return 0 + 3 . For every subsequent iteration, acc receives the previous iteration‚Äôs return value . This is the tricky part of reduce . We named the parameter acc , because it‚Äôs like a snowball rolling down a hill; it accumulates the value of each iteration. This isn‚Äôt true for all reduce functions, but it‚Äôs a good analogy in this case. Following the sequence, the second iteration receives 3 as the acc parameter (since the first iteration returned 0 + 3 ), and it adds that value to the next item in our array: return 3 + 5; . The third iteration receives 8 as the acc (since 3 + 5 is 8), and returns 8 + 1 . This process continues until the final iteration, where it returns 13 + 2 , which resolves to our final answer, 15 . Visualize it As I said earlier, I don‚Äôt expect these words to work miracles. The hardest part of learning reduce is developing an intuitive understanding of how data flows through it from iteration to iteration. This visualization showcases the above example of adding values. Click the GIF to view it in its entirety: View the visualization Play with it The best way to solidify understanding is to actually do it. I created a JSBin with the sample reduce summing code; poke around with it! Sprinkle some console.log s around to see what the variables hold. Try messing with it, and see what happens. Another Example Because reduce gives you full control over its output, it‚Äôs extremely flexible, and not just used for summing numbers. Let‚Äôs look at a common data-wrangling concern. Let‚Äôs say we have an array of user objects, and we want to create a map-like object. This is actually a pretty common problem, as libraries like Redux advocate storing data in a database-like tree structure: ‚Äú`js // Let‚Äôs say our data comes back from // the API as an array of objects: const inputFromServer = [   {id: ‚Äòa‚Äô, name: ‚ÄòAmy‚Äô},   {id: ‚Äòb‚Äô, name: ‚ÄòBlanche‚Äô},   {id: ‚Äòc‚Äô, name: ‚ÄòClaude‚Äô}, ]; // We‚Äôd like to create a map-like object: const desiredOutput = {     a: {id: ‚Äòa‚Äô, name: ‚ÄòAmy‚Äô},     b: {id: ‚Äòb‚Äô, name: ‚ÄòBlanche‚Äô},     c: {id: ‚Äòc‚Äô, name: ‚ÄòClaude‚Äô}, }; ‚Äú` We can‚Äôt simply use map here, because we want to return an object , not an array. reduce to the rescue! ‚Äú`js const getMapFromArray = data => (   data.reduce((acc, item) => {     acc[item.id] = item; return acc; }, {}) ); getMapFromArray(inputFromServer) // returns an object identical to desiredOutput . ‚Äú` Our initialValue is an empty object, and on each iteration, we augment it with the item provided. Each item in the array is added to acc object, keyed by its id . Practice: recreate map and filter with reduce By now, it should be clear that reduce is an extremely flexible method, compared to map or filter . You may be surprised to learn, though, that map and filter can be reimplemented with reduce . Your challenge, should you choose to accept it: Create map and filter functions that replicate the native functionality, but using reduce internally. Here are some JSBins that set this up. Good luck! Implement map Implement filter Stuck? You can view the solutions here . Do your best to figure it out before peeking, though! Using the right tool for the job reduce is a very handy hammer, but not every problem is a nail. For example, you might think that this is a perfect problem statement for reduce : ‚Äú` Given an array of values, filter out all negative values, and double all remaining values. eg. [2, -4, 6] -> [4, 12] ‚Äú` This is totally solvable by reduce ! We can write a little function that just returns the acc if the item is negative, and pushes in a doubled item if it‚Äôs positive! ‚Äú`js const positiveDoubler = data => (   data.reduce((acc, item) => {     if (item < 0) {       return acc;     } return [...acc, item * 2]; }, []) ); ‚Äú` This works, but this function is really doing two different things. Why not break it up into discrete steps? ‚Äú`js const isPositive = item => item >= 0; const doubleItem = item => item * 2; const positiveDoubler = data => (   data     .filter(isPositive)     .map(doubleItem) ) ‚Äú` I think most would agree that this solution is clearer. The moral of the story? reduce is awesome, but sometimes there are simpler solutions. Always strive to write code that others can easily understand. Shorthand Syntax JavaScript‚Äôs implementation of reduce offers a convenient shorthand. I didn‚Äôt mention this earlier, because I wanted to strip away all the non-essential bits before covering this little bit of syntactic sugar. In fact, if you still don‚Äôt feel like you have a firm grasp on reduce , I‚Äôd advise skipping this section for now. It‚Äôs not necessary knowledge to use reduce . The shorthand allows you to omit an initialValue . If you do, reduce uses the first two values in the array as the first two parameters in your callback. Let‚Äôs look again at our summing example: ‚Äú`js const arr = [3, 5, 1, 4, 2]; const total = arr.reduce((acc, item) => {   return acc + item; }); ‚Äú` If no initialValue is provided, then acc takes on the value of 3 and item takes on the value of 5 . For this example specifically , everything still works as-intended, but there are only 4 iterations instead of 5. Note that this is not always the case; Our data-wrangling example needs the initial value of {} . Conclusion Phew! You made it. If reduce still doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs totally sunken in yet, don‚Äôt worry. Keep practicing! It‚Äôs worth the effort.", "date": "2017-07-10"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "App Engine Flex Language Shootout", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/app-engine-flex-language-shootout/", "abstract": "By Amos Latteier This is the second time I‚Äôve been to Silicon Valley. Some years ago ‚Äì never mind how long precisely ‚Äì I started writing open source software. It‚Äôs taken me to some strange places like Washington DC and Kwajalein , but never until recently to the suburbs of San Jose. The reason I‚Äôm here is for a hackathon. I recently was hired by Khan Academy. I live in Vancouver, the one in Canada. I work remotely. In fact most of the people I work closely with are remote. This is one of the great things about this new job. Also it turns out that I get to work with smart and friendly people. And instead of writing a CRM for insurance salespeople like I was doing at my last gig, my job is to help anyone anywhere get a free world-class education. There‚Äôs got to be a catch. Maybe it‚Äôs this hackathon. What kind of hackathon is this anyway? Apparently it‚Äôs healthy . Growing up my mother was very focused on healthy foods. My sister and I used to break into the carob chips, looking for anything candy-like. So if it‚Äôs anything like that I know that I‚Äôm in trouble. The offices are covered in decorations when I arrive. This seems less like a hackathon and more like a craft party. I feel a bit out of place, so I cut a cape out of felt and put it on. That‚Äôs better. Rather than endurance coding, we do a lot of socializing and collecting donations for a food bank interspersed with project work. I decide to work with someone I don‚Äôt know on a fun-sounding project. A fun-sounding project The co-worker I don‚Äôt know explains the project to me. Right now Khan Academy runs on App Engine. Classic , not flex . There‚Äôs interest in moving to flex. It turns out that they are pretty different. There‚Äôs a ton of institutional knowledge here about classic built up over years. But we don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with flex. This project is about getting some experience with flex. Plus the project is a language shootout. Right now most of the backend code is in Python, but there are fantasies about moving to another language. Who doesn‚Äôt fantasize about other languages? I‚Äôm currently infatuated with Elixir . It‚Äôs possible that I like it because I haven‚Äôt used it for any serious projects yet. But I have tried writing distributed systems (and even worse, debugging distributed systems written by others) in Python, and that was a bad enough experience to make me look for alternatives. Anyway we‚Äôre probably not going to switch languages anytime soon, but it‚Äôs fun to dream. The task we set ourselves is to consume a pub/sub feed and put the results into BigQuery . The feed collects information about about exercises attempted by users of Khan Academy. There is a lot of exercise data. We must first validate the message using a hmac digest. We use a secret stored in metadata . Next parse the pub/sub message. Then send it to BigQuery. We have to insure that the right table exists and then insert the data. Oh, and we need to run a web server, cause that‚Äôs how you do push subscriptions . So it‚Äôs not too much work, but not completely trivial. The contenders Of course I‚Äôm going to write a service in Elixir. In fact that‚Äôs the reason I chose this project. Elixir Elixir is a new marketing campaign for Erlang. Well technically it‚Äôs more than that, but from my point of view the great things about Elixir are OTP and BEAM. My coworker already has the Elixir implementation started. I only have to add a few things to get it working, but there are no official Google Cloud libraries so that ends up being my biggest challenge. Go Go is a language that not many people who I know seem to be enthusiastic about. But hey, why not try it? There are bound to be decent Google Cloud Platform library for it, right? And it compiles fast. Kotlin Kotlin is a language that I haven‚Äôt heard of until recently. But my manager loves it, so I guess I should test it. Actually it doesn‚Äôt seem to be as dreadful as I expected. Plus some people say that they‚Äôve gotten the JVM working pretty well these days. One downside is that it doesn‚Äôt compile as fast as go does. Python Python is the language I‚Äôve hitched my professional career to. Happily for me Python isn‚Äôt dead yet. Khan Academy uses a lot of Python. Yeah, it‚Äôs slow. Also under flex you have to choose your own WSGI server. I‚Äôm not sure we chose the best one. If we had more time I‚Äôd like to look into this more. Crystal Crystal is a language I‚Äôve never heard of. But my coworker checks in a microservice written in one night. He says it‚Äôs fun. Interlude in which my mind is blown We‚Äôre making progress on the project, mostly due to my co-worker‚Äôs efforts. I‚Äôm spending most of my time trying to understand the code he‚Äôs checking in. But then comes the Python Bee. It‚Äôs like a spelling bee, but in Python. That sounds cool; I know Python. So it turns out there‚Äôs a wrinkle. You have to speak out your program, character by character without looking at the screen while someone else types it in for you. OK, so you have to keep it all in your head and not mess up on indenting. I think I can do this. Oh wait, it turns out that you have a partner, and you can‚Äôt communicate with them, and you each take turns saying the next character of the program! So it‚Äôs not just keeping the program in your head, it‚Äôs guessing what program is in your partner‚Äôs head too. Two people are writing a prime number sieve in Haskell using mind reading. This is happening right in front of me right now. Now it‚Äôs my turn. Ok, ok, ok, ok. [IndentationError]{.title-ref}. Ugh, not only does this look really hard, it is really hard too. Some benchmarking results We don‚Äôt get around to doing message validation on all the different microservices. So our benchmark isn‚Äôt fair. In fact it‚Äôs not even particularly precise. We just start the microservices, point the pub/sub firehose at them and see how far behind they fall during the day, and how long it takes them to catch up with the backlog in the evening. Still it isn‚Äôt hard to see how each language fares. Language   Speed Kotlin     Fast   Elixir     Not quite as fast as Kotlin   Go         Pretty much as fast a Elixir   Python     Quite a bit slower We can‚Äôt get Crystal running well enough to compete. We run into ssl errors and don‚Äôt have enough time to track down a solution. After doing this sloppy benchmark I‚Äôm not sure that it‚Äôs really a great argument to switch away from Python. Speed is only one consideration among many. In practice it seems that the quality of Google Cloud Platform libraries is probably one of the most important factors in picking a language for our benchmark, since we rely so heavily on Google Cloud Platform. I am impressed with Elixir‚Äôs performance, though. It almost kept up with Kotlin, and hey confirmation bias. I also wonder about whether we should be consuming pub/sub messages with a push queue. I suspect that performance would be much better using a pull queue, since then we could batch our BigQuery inserts. Often the best way to improve performance is changing the algorithm not the language. Anyway we present our results. People nod respectfully. Ours is just one in a vast and riotous sea of hackathon projects. We haven‚Äôt figured out the organization‚Äôs future language strategy, but we have gotten some practical experience with App engine flex. Plus we‚Äôve validated that microservices seem to work OK for a simple task that‚Äôs bounded by external APIs. Afterward I‚Äôm still really in awe of the Python Bee performances I saw. I asked the Haskellers how they did it. Foldl I was told. Foldl makes sense for this kind of thing. If you are both thinking ‚ÄùFoldl, foldl, foldl‚Äù then it‚Äôs easier to read each other‚Äôs minds. I‚Äôm probably not going to learn Haskell, but I know about reduce. Next year I just need to find a partner who‚Äôs also thinking ‚ÄùReduce, reduce, reduce‚Äù. That and remember how many spaces we‚Äôre indented.", "date": "2017-04-17"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Babel in Khan Academy‚Äôs i18n Toolchain", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/babel-in-khan-academys-i18n-toolchain/", "abstract": "By Kevin Barabash We‚Äôve been using ES6 (along with JSX) for sometime at Khan Academy. Right now, we‚Äôre using jstransform to compile our ES6 and JSX code to ES5, but we‚Äôd like to switch to babel . Some of the reasons for doing this include: better support for ES6 + ES7 allows us to use eslint , making it easier for open source contributors to lint their code and run the tests in projects such as perseus . i18n Workflow Our i18n workflow on the frontend uses a custom plugin for jstransform which converts certain JSXElements into special function calls. input : <$_ first=\"Hayao\" last=\"Miyazaki\">\n    Hello, %(first)s %(last)s\n</$_>\n<$i18nDoNotTranslate>var x = 5;</$i18nDoNotTranslate> desired output : $_({ first: \"Hayao\", last: \"Miyazaki\" }, \n    \"Hello, %(first)s %(last)s!\"\n);\n$i18nDoNotTranslate(\"var x = 5;\"); While babel has support for JSX, it transforms all JSXElements into calls to React.createElement() . This would result in the following incorrect output: actual output : React.createElement(\n    $_,\n    { first: \"Motoko\", last: \"Kusanagi\" },\n    \"Hello, %(first)s %(last)s!\"\n);\nReact.createElement($i18nDoNotTranslate, null, \n    \"var x = 5\"); Plugin Before we can switch to babel, we need to customize babel‚Äôs output when it encounters <$_> or <$i18nDoNotTranslate> tag. We can use babel‚Äôs plugin architecture . It‚Äôs relatively straight forward. Each plugin is a node module which exports a single function which returns a babel.Transformer instance. babel.Transformer takes two arguments: the name of the transformer as a string and an object containing callbacks. module.exports = function (babel) {\n    var t = babel.types;\n    return new babel.Transformer(\"i18n-plugin\", {\n        JSXElement: function (node, parent, scope, file) {\n            // inspect node, parent, scope, etc.\n            // construct a tree and return its root\n            \n            // example: \n            // construct a new \"CallExpression\"\n            // assumes callee and args exist\n            var call = t.callExpression(callee, args);\n            \n            // copy the location from the source node \n            // so that line numbers can be maintained\n            call.loc = node.loc;\n            return call;\n        }\n    }\n}; After the JavaScript source is parsed, babel will run the callback on each node it finds in the AST of the specified type. An AST ( Abstract Syntax Tree ) is a tree structure where each node represents a part of the syntatic structure of a piece of code such as statements, expressions, identifiers, literals, etc. The keys for the object should be one of the node types listed in the babel source . This list of nodes extends Mozilla‚Äôs original Parser API . Some notes about the example: babel.types provides functions for creating new nodes babel also supports calling on exit, or calling on both enter and exit if needed full source code for the plugin as available in Khan/i18n-babel-plugin . Matching Output When developing this plugin it was important that we match the output we were getting from jstransform so that babel could be a drop-in replacement without having to modify other parts of our build chain. In particular we needed to ensure that we were maintaining both line numbers in compiled code as well as whitespace within translation strings. Line Numbers Maintaining line numbers is important because not all of our build chain is source map aware. In particular kake, our custom build system, does not know how to deal with source maps. Babel‚Äôs ‚ÄúretainLines‚Äù options takes care of this for us. We did however find one issue with ‚ÄúretainLines‚Äù. If a method call had 3 or more arguments then Babel would ignore ‚ÄúretainLines‚Äù and pretty print it so that each argument was on a separate line. Babel‚Äôs maintainer sebmck was quite responsive and provided an update within a couple of hours. Whitespace As for whitespace within localized strings, any changes in the whitespace means that the string is essentially a different string which means that that string would need to be re-translated into different languages for all our localized sites. In order to make sure that our Babel plugin produces calls to $_() with the same strings as jstransform we need to compare all of the JavaScript strings. One of our build steps generates a .pot file (used by Gettext http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext ) containing all of the strings on the site that need to be localized. We generated .pot files using both the jstransform and babel workflows and compared them using a python script. The script uses polib to parse the .pot files generated by the two workflows and iterate through the entries. It looks at the occurrences property to pick out the items that came from javascript and creates a dict from msgid->entry. example.pot : #: modules/user/views_handler_filter_user_name.inc:29\nmsgid \"Enter a comma separated list of user names.\"\nmsgstr \"\"\n#: modules/user/views_handler_filter_user_name.inc:112\nmsgid \"Unable to find user: @users\"\nmsgid_plural \"Unable to find users: @users\"\nmsgstr[0] \"\"\nmsgstr[1] \"\" We then compared the two dicts and looked for differences in occurrences or strings. There were a few discrepancies in line numbers which had to be investigated manually. It turned out that the jstransform line numbers were off by a line from the source line numbers. While this was not an issue, there were quite a few strings that weren‚Äôt the same. Close inspection of these revealed that the differences were differences in whitespace. Various patterns of carriage returns and spaces were producing the differences in whitespace. Creating test cases (and fixes) for a few of these situations and then re-running our string comparison script allowed us to quickly narrow the large number of mismatched strings into a relatively few test cases. Below are two fixtures used by the harness which compiles input.jsx using our babel plugin and compares the output against expected.js . test/fixtures/i18n-line-feed/input.jsx : var a = <$_>hello,\n        world!\n        </$_>;\nvar b = <$_>\n        \n        hello,\n        world!</$_>;\nvar c = <$_>\n        {\"hello, \"}\n        world!\n        </$_>;\nvar d = <$_>\nhello, world!</$_>; test/fixtures/i18n-line-feed/expected.js : var a = $_(null, \"hello, world!\");\nvar b = $_(null, \"hello, world!\");\nvar c = $_(null, \n\"hello, \", \"world!\");\nvar d = $_(null, \"hello, world!\"); Issues We also wanted to make sure that all of JavaScript was being compiled correctly before rolling out these changes to all of our developers. We had already refactored our build scripts to compile our ES6 and JSX files so that we could extract localizable strings. let We started with manual testing. The homepage wasn‚Äôt loading. Uh-oh. Investigation revealed that the compiled code contained the let keyword which most browsers don‚Äôt support. What‚Äôs weird about this is that we didn‚Äôt use let in any of source code. Where was it coming from? In the new build script we specify a whitelist of transformers for babel to use. This list is conservative. We wanted to match the functionality of jstransform and then adopt other features on an ‚Äúas needed‚Äù basis. Here‚Äôs the initial list of transformers we were using: es6.arrowFunctions es6.classes es6.destructuring es6.parameters.rest es6.templateLiterals es6.spread es7.objectRestSpread After doing some hunting I found out that some of the es6 transfomers actually desugar ES6 to other ES6. In this case the es6.classes transformer was producing code with let . source.js : class MyAwesomeClass { ... } compiled.js : let MyAwesomeClass = function() { ... } The fix was pretty simple, add es6.blockScoping to the whitelist. functionName transformer shadows globals The next issue we ran into was with a seemingly innocuous method. Here‚Äôs the full mixin to give some context: set-interval-mixin.js : var SetIntervalMixin = {\n    componentWillMount: function() {\n        this.intervals = [];\n    },\n    setInterval: function setInterval(fn, ms) {\n        this.intervals.push(setInterval(fn, ms));\n    },\n    componentWillUnmount: function() {\n        this.intervals.forEach(clearInterval);\n    }\n}; It adds a setInterval method to other classes and makes sure that the intervals are cleaned up with the component unmounts. The issue is that setInterval was being transformed to this: setInterval: function setInterval(fn, ms) {     \n    setInterval(fn, ms);\n} By default babel turns anonymous function expressions into named function expressions. In most cases this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue, but in this case the named function shadows the global setInterval . When the setInterval method is called on the object it ends up calling itself. The second time it‚Äôs called, this is bound to window and it blows up. This issue was fixed after I erroneously reported it as a React bug and Ben Alpert correctly reported it as a babel bug and Sebastian McKenzie, maintainer of babel, fixed it. Summary We‚Äôre looking forward to use babel so that we can leverage the power of ES6‚Äôs new features. Babel‚Äôs plugin architecture is easy and helped maintain our i18n workflow without a lot of work. The minor issues that did crop up were quickly resolved. Thanks We‚Äôd like to thank babel‚Äôs maintainer Sebastian McKenzie for the quick turnaround when it came to dealing with issues in babel.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "The Autonomous Dumbledore", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/the-autonomous-dumbledore/", "abstract": "By Evy Kassirer When I arrived at Khan Academy to start my internship on the Official SAT Practice team, they had just released a huge new feature in the product: students could now link their PSAT scores to their Khan Academy accounts to immediately personalize their practice suggestions. This feature was very important to us, and everyone was proud of Khan Academy and College Board for completing it with such limited time. The Problem Unfortunately, due to scheduled system maintenance periods, this feature occasionally has to be disabled. There were also a few bugs that surfaced over the week after the release, breaking the feature at unscheduled times. This forced folks from both Khan Academy and College Board to wake up in the middle of the night to check the status of PSAT linking and enable/disable the feature. Our site when PSAT linking is enabled Our site when PSAT linking is disabled At Khan Academy, employee wellness is one of our top priorities. We were losing sleep over something that could be replaced with some code. Introducing the Autonomous Dumbledore Artist: kcgreenn We decided to create the Autonomous Dumbledore, a friendly wizard that automagically updates Khan Academy‚Äôs site to reflect if PSAT linking is currently working. Here‚Äôs an overview of how Dumbledore works: cron jobs are periodically running endpoint tests : we try to fetch PSAT scores from the College Board API endpoints, and record whether we succeeded or failed. another cron job looks at recent results of our endpoint tests ‚Äì if enough of them succeeded or failed, we‚Äôll enable or disable the PSAT feature accordingly However, deciding if the PSAT feature should be enabled or disabled was far from black and white. My mentor John Sullivan and I got thinking about how Dumbledore would decide the logic behind the magic. When Should We Flip the Switch? To decide to turn on and off the PSAT feature, we look at ‚Äú recent results of our endpoint tests and see if enough tests are failing or passing to enable or disable the PSAT feature‚Äù. But how recent? How many failing or passing tests are enough? Do those answers change when we enable vs. disable the feature? Recent Looking at recent test results is important to catch the endpoint going down soon after it happens. The further back we look, the more passing tests we‚Äôre looking at, and the harder it is to tell that things are mostly failing right now when looking at simple aggregate values like ‚Äúratio of successful tests to failed ones‚Äù. However, we are only able to do a few tests per minute. If we only look at the tests from the past minute, there won‚Äôt be enough data to make an educated decision. Enough How many tests should be passing to keep on the PSAT feature? If we turn it off for any failure, any little error could turn off the PSAT feature for all of our users. If we only turned off the feature once every recent test was failing, bugs that only affected only some (but still many) users could break the feature in confusing ways for a lot of people and for a long time. Right now we look at the past 5 minutes worth of endpoints tests and turn off the feature if less than 10% of the tests are passing. This means that the PSAT feature might not be working for up to 5 minutes before the site reflects it. The message that alertlib sends us in Slack when PSAT linking turned off Enabling vs. Disabling We then realized that deciding not to disable the feature was not the same as deciding to enable the feature. I mentioned above that we disable the feature if less than 10% of tests in the last 5 minutes are passing. If 50% of the tests in the last 5 minutes are passing, we wouldn‚Äôt decide to turn off PSAT linking, but if the feature was already off it doesn‚Äôt make sense to turn it back on yet, even though 50% isn‚Äôt less than 10%- 50% of tests are still failing! For the decision to turn the feature back on, we look at a longer timeframe of test results, and expect at least 90% of them to be passing. The message that alertlib sends us in Slack when PSAT linking turned on All of this logic got pretty complicated ‚Äì there were even more subtleties than these! We carefully thought about how to clearly organize our code and unit test each piece of functionality to make sure Dumbledore was working as expected. Google App Engine, Cron, and Deploy Fun After a few weeks of work, Dumbledore was ready! It was time to deploy him to the world to perform his magical duties. This took a bit longer than John and I were expecting, but we learned a bunch about Google App Engine and Cron in the process! Here are some highlights: Composite indexes take a long time to build There are multiple College Board endpoints that we test. We store them in a class that looks like this: ‚Äú` {.python} class CollegeBoardTestResult(ndb.Model): ‚Äú‚Äù‚ÄùThe results from a single test on College Board‚Äôs servers. This serves as a record for whether College Board was up at this time. \"\"\"  # The type of test this entity stores the results for test_type = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=True, required=True,                                choices=[\"session-test\", \"oauth-test\"])  # Naive datetime (ie: tzinfo is None) recording when the test ended.

To make this lookup efficient, App Engine creates (when we deploy) a new composite index that refers to both test_type and end_time . Turns out that creating this new composite index makes the deploy take several hours! Dumbledore would not work until we finished building the composite index, which prevented us from quickly seeing how Dumbledore performed in production and ended up pushing us past the deadline we set for the project. Now that we know deploying composite indexes takes a while, we can plan these deploys more strategically. I‚Äôve also recently learned that it‚Äôs possible to create new indexes outside of deploys with gcloud preview app deploy index.yaml , which takes equally as long but can be started before the rest of the change is ready to deploy. Cron isn‚Äôt built to run continuously Remember when I said we have cron jobs running all the time to collect information about the College Board endpoints? Turns out App Engine‚Äôs cron doesn‚Äôt like running tasks back to back. This is how we got it to work: We set the timing in the cron configuration file to be schedule: every 1 minutes synchronized . The minimum amount of time we can wait between cron jobs is 1 minute. By default, every 1 minutes would start a new task one minute after the previous ended. Adding synchronized has it run every minute. Stop the handler servicing cron‚Äôs request after 45 seconds. When we let it run for the full minute, it would take some time to wrap up, go over a minute, and stop the job synchronously scheduled for the next minute from starting. When we stopped it after 45 seconds, which is a pretty hacky way to solve our problem, the job was always able to start at the beginning of every minute. For various reasons, we couldn‚Äôt properly test this without actually uploading the code to App Engine. It took around 10 deploys to figure out how to get it working in production, but finally the Autonomous Dumbledore was alive and working well! The Awesome Results of the Autonomous Dumbledore If outages start late or end earlier than planned, we can detect it and keep the PSAT feature up, allowing students to use it for (almost) the full time the system is up Sometimes outages last a bit longer than expected, and that‚Äôs automatically handled We learned a bunch of cool stuff about Google App Engine and Cron And my favourite‚Ä¶ No one has to stay up late or wake up early to monitor logs and flip a switch! class CollegeBoardTestResult(ndb.Model):\n        \"\"\"The results from a single test on College Board's servers.\n\n        This serves as a record for whether College Board was up at this time.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # The type of test this entity stores the results for\n        test_type = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=True, required=True,\n                                       choices=[\"session-test\", \"oauth-test\"])\n\n        # Naive datetime (ie: tzinfo is None) recording when the test ended.

So, I thought I‚Äôd share a bit about a few of our custom linters in hopes that others may invest a little time to prevent more bugs. For more than just formatting JavaScript programmers will be familiar with tools like ESLint and Python programmers may be familiar with pylint . Teams spend time arguing about what their code style is and then configure the linters to enforce that consistent style. For many folks, I‚Äôd imagine that their primary experience with linters is something along the lines of ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs the tool that complains when I put my brace in the wrong place.‚Äù I‚Äôm a big fan of Prettier , which has completely eliminated both formatting errors and discussion of code formatting for our JavaScript code. Even with code formatting being a ‚Äúsolved problem‚Äù, we rely more on linters than ever. They serve the important purpose of maintaining code quality by preventing known bad patterns from sneaking in. Staying in sync In our web application, we‚Äôve got code written in JavaScript, Python, and Kotlin. One bit of complexity that naturally comes up when from having multiple languages is that sometimes you‚Äôll need to keep files in sync. Imagine that we‚Äôve duplicated a small bit of logic between two of the languages, or that there‚Äôs an interface shared between the two that must be changed in tandem. Sure, we do our best to minimize those case, but they can be hard to avoid entirely. Our code_syncing_lint.py linter is set up to handle this problem. It defines this comment format: ‚Äú`py sync-start: sync-end: ‚Äú` tag is a name you give to the block of code. The linter ensures that if you make a change in one file in a given commit, there must also be a change in the block with the same tag name in filename as well. Frontend best practices Khan Academy has been around for several years now and JavaScript development has changed a lot over those years. Where we used to use Handlebars and LESS files for defining our client-side views, we now use React with Aphrodite . At this point, if someone creates a new Handlebars or LESS file in our repository, they‚Äôre working against the direction we‚Äôre pushing for our frontend. So, we have a linter that makes sure that no new files of those types are created. That linter comes complete with a whitelist of the files we haven‚Äôt yet managed to get rid of. As much as possible, when we introduce a new lint rule, we fix up all of the lint discovered by the rule. Rewriting a Handlebars template as React components is a non-trivial change, so this linter has a whitelist of those pre-existing files that are allowed to break the rule. You can lint images, too One of our engineers, Colin Fuller, noticed that some of the images on our team page looked off. The page is a grid of photos cropped to the same sizes, but some of the photos looked stretched. During our February Healthy Hackathon , Colin wrote a linter that double checks that every team photo is the same size. The linter is only about 50 lines of Python, comments included. Avoiding tests that accidentally overwrite others Have you ever copy/pasted an existing unit test to create a new test case for a different variation? Sometimes, all you want to do is call the function under test with different arguments, so copy/paste is the easy solution. Imagine you have a piece of a test class that looks like this, after a copy/paste: ‚Äú`py def test_foo1(self):     self.assertEqual(1, foo(‚Äúone‚Äù)) def test_foo1(self):     self.assertEqual(2, foo(‚Äútwo‚Äù)) ‚Äú` It‚Äôs pretty easy to forget to change the test method name and not notice that the original test will no longer be called. We have a linter that watches for this. Avoiding problems with third-party libraries Third-party libraries don‚Äôt always work the way we‚Äôd want them to. Many times, the right answer is to put up a pull request for the library. But what happens if the behavior of the library is by design ? We‚Äôve got a case of that in our codebase. For example, we use persistgraphql to extract GraphQL queries from our client-side code so that we can allow only specific queries to run. The problem we ran into is that persistgraphql reformats the queries in a way that works fine for their main use case, but could make the queries not match up with what our server-side code expects. Our solution is a linter that guarantees that the query in the JavaScript code will exactly match the query expected by the server. You can import this but you can‚Äôt import that As part of our Great Python Refactoring , we instituted new rules about which code was allowed to import which other code, to help avoid future similar tangles. We could impose restrictions via Python import hooks, but we wouldn‚Äôt find out about those problems until runtime. Our components_lint.py linter ensures at commit time that we aren‚Äôt breaking the rules. Of course, the Great Python Refactoring didn‚Äôt take care of every bothersome import, but the linter has a simple whitelist that we‚Äôll whittle down as we continue to clean things up. Tip: Keep linters fast with regular expressions Yes, yes, we all know you can‚Äôt parse HTML with a regular expression . When you need to be correct 100{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} of the time, you need to use a proper parser. But many times a regular expression will suffice and be much faster. While regular expression syntax can seem quite obscure (or become a maintenance nightmare ), regexes can actually be easier to understand than code designed to traverse a parse tree. As an added bonus, linters like our code_syncing_lint mentioned earlier can work on Python, JavaScript, and Kotlin files without needing three separate parsers and a whole lot more code. But beware! It‚Äôs easy for a regex to not properly handle legitimate, real world code files, so just keep that tradeoff in mind. Linters are like any other code, though, so you can write unit tests to verify the expected cases as we have for ours. Lint all the things! Once you have the basic hooks in place to run linters automatically, you‚Äôll doubtless find many ways in which you can prevent common sorts of bugs from creeping in to your system. ESLint has rules to help you with frequent JavaScript mistakes, but I‚Äôd bet there are other potential pitfalls that are unique to your environment. I hope this tour of some of our linters gives you ideas for some of your own. Thanks to Ben Kraft, Craig Silverstein, and Amos Latteier for their suggestions of good example linters from our code, and Scott Grant for editing advice.", "date": "2018-07-26"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "How to upgrade hundreds of React components without breaking production", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/how-to-upgrade-hundreds-of-react-components-without-breaking-production/", "abstract": "By Jangmi Jo Background In 2018, we started renewing our color system using our new shared design system, Wonder Blocks (‚ÄúWB‚Äù in short). WB reduces site colors from 48 to 18 to improve accessibility and consistency. It also includes one primary color to draw attention to actionable objects. We decided to remove and replace the old ‚Äúdomain colors‚Äù, which were specific to particular domains of content, such as ‚Äúmath‚Äù, ‚Äúscience‚Äù, etc. As part of this update, I was tasked with replacing our old buttons and links that were using those domain colors with our new WB components. Strategies Make a prop conversion guide from the target components to the new Wonder Blocks components As I converted old components, I kept track of each old prop and how to achieve parity with the new component. This way, I could refer to the guide to make future conversions quite simple. In addition, anyone else helping out could also use the guide. Using it ensured all conversions were consistent. The following is a small excerpt from the guide: ‚Ä¶ If the Button has these props, just remove them. juicy hoverColor domain type=‚Äùprimary‚Äù (primary is the new default) color (Use color=‚Äùdestructive‚Äù if it‚Äôs destructive button. Otherwise, remove color prop) If the Button has these props, consider the following: width (Remove it from props and use minWidth in style) ‚Ä¶ Categorize the changes by team, keep the changes very small, and deploy often By doing this, I could reduce the chances of merge conflicts and make deployment more painless. At Khan Academy, we organize the code by packages, each of which is owned by one team. By keeping each commit within one package, I could request reviews and ask design questions from the correct team and it was straightforward to write test plans since the change only impacted one area of the site. In general, it‚Äôs easier for reviewers to provide detailed reviews when the changes are small. I tried to keep changes limited to only touching 10 files. Some might say, ‚Äúain‚Äôt nobody got time for monster diffs‚Äù. Commits shown categorized by package Keeping number of files touched and lines of code changed small Write a detailed test plan with before and after screenshots Normally we would have a mockup for a new change but for this renewal, we had to do an entire codebase sweep without new mockups. Since these changes crossed so many areas of the site, I asked each team to assign a designer and code reviewer to validate the changes. We also needed to make changes in lesser-known areas of the codebase, so I wrote test plans including steps to navigate to where the component is rendered and screenshots at various screen widths (for responsive views) to give reviewers an at-a-glance summary of the change. URLs and screenshots for responsive views in commit description In practice Having decided upon appropriate guidelines, I started the component conversion one by one. I  made a list of all the components that needed conversion, and just picked one and went for it. Since our web application has been around for a long time, there are so many product areas that I didn‚Äôt know about. Still, I needed to touch code all over the place and I didn‚Äôt want to break anything accidentally. Naturally, having a good testing strategy was very important. Depending on the parent component of the target, I did the following: Components in commonly used parts of the site This type of component is mostly modern and relatively easy to test. They usually are specific enough that I can figure out where they are in the application and see it rendered before and after conversion to test. I included a before and after screenshot to simplify the review process. Before and after screenshots in commit description It became tricky when the component was shared across the entire app, like the Breadcrumb component, which is used frequently in different contexts. It takes more time and effort to thoroughly test each place. This called for a more detailed test plan. Even though the change was small, there were many places where this component was rendered that had to be tested. Again, screenshots helped reviewers out here. Before and after screenshots for shared component Components in less commonly used parts of the site As a ten-year-old site, we have some older components in our code which aren‚Äôt changed often. In some cases, I felt lucky to find anyone who knew where these were used. Some of these older components didn‚Äôt even make good use of our system of ‚Äúfixture tests‚Äù which render components outside of their normal context in the site (we use a custom framework for this, but React Storybook is another popular solution). The lack of good tests for those made safely making changes more difficult. Example of when we used a fixture to verify the results For those unlucky cases, I wrote a temporary fixture or injected that component in a known area of my development server with fake props just to see how the component looks. I then took screenshots and removed my temporary work. This was extra difficult because many of the old components have Backbone mixed in. The following is an example of a test plan using a temporary hack in order to verify the conversion. Test Plan: Comment out mixins: [BackboneMixin] , in javascript/exercises-legacy-package/components/exercise-footer.jsx Make const maybeConfetti = null in render function. Add return \"\" in javascript/tasks-package/completion-criteria-formatter.js:26 Uncomment javascript/exercises-legacy-package/components/exercise-footer.jsx.fixture.js Visit fixture http://localhost:8081/react-sandbox/exercises-legacy-package/components/exercise-footer.jsx.fixture.js Change the props to see various buttons. Challenges It took me a little over a month, totalling 68 commits and touching 174 files. During this procedure, here are some things that made this task challenging: 1. Lots of infrequently touched product area Many changes touched older code which hadn‚Äôt been updated for years and didn‚Äôt have the tests we require now. That was tough but the only thing I could do was to try my best. It really reinforced the importance of writing tests. Writing good tests ensures future engineers can modify old code comfortably even when the original authors are gone. 2. Time difference and communication During this project, I worked from South Korea, which is 16 hours ahead of Mountain View. That made communication harder since I was asleep during normal office hours. To combat this, I wrote detailed test plans with fool-proof reproduction steps so that I could minimize the number of questions and reduce back and forth on code reviews. 3. Button and Link components can cause either client- or server-side navigation We started converting our site to a single page app (SPA) last year. Some parts had already been converted, but others still used the old architecture. Sometimes, it wasn‚Äôt clear whether I should use client-side navigation or trigger navigation to a new page. This led to an unexpected error after deployment when one of the converted Links used client side navigation to a page that wasn‚Äôt in the SPA. This caused the page to go blank for that route, and we had to quickly change the Link to use server-side navigation (This unfortunately happened while I was sleeping ‚Äì thanks to John Resig for the fix!) Summary Converting a variety of older, inconsistent components to a single new component takes time, effort, patience, and good tests. Thanks Special thanks to John Resig and Kevin Barabash who supported the decision to convert links and buttons as part of the color system rollout and all the designers and engineers who reviewed the changes.", "date": "2019-09-23"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Copy-pasting more than just text", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/copy-pasting-more-than-just-text/", "abstract": "By Sam Lau The Result I‚Äôll skip to the happy ending. This little feature implements more sophisticated copy-pasting for the interactive widgets we use for our exercises and articles, making life for our content creators easier. See it in action: Notice that the copied content is just text, but when it‚Äôs pasted the metadata associated with the text is copied over properly. For example, the image URL is copied over properly and the number line‚Äôs starting value is still 3 after being copied and pasted back and forth between the two text boxes. First, About Perseus Our exercises are created using Perseus , a question editor and renderer that makes it simple to create interactive problems. Before we had Perseus, we had a framework called Khan Exercises . However, to write exercise content, content writers essentially had to know how to program. As you can imagine, this made scaling up work on content difficult. Perseus, which is what you see in that animation above, allows for easier interactive content creation through widgets. For example, the animation above features an image and a number line widget. This live exercise features a transformer widget. The Problem Before, copy-pasting worked like this: Those are sad faces, if you couldn‚Äôt tell. Perseus is becoming more and more useful to us. In fact, during my internship my mentor and I worked on functionality to use Perseus to write our articles. It quickly became clear that we‚Äôd have to put our rush to implement features on hold in order to iron out some annoying issues with the editor. One of these issues was the fact that if content creators wanted to move or duplicate a widget, they‚Äôd have to make a new widget and manually input all the settings they wanted. In the case of the image above, they would have to copy over the image URL as well as other metadata, like the caption and the alt text. We thought that it‚Äôd be great if copy-pasting worked transparently for our content creators. The Approach There are essentially two components that I want to remember when a content creator cuts or copies a piece of text. First, is the copied text itself. This usually looks something like: Hello, this is some text and here's an image widget.  [[‚òÉ image 1]] The [[‚òÉ image 1]] is a placeholder that tells Perseus that there is an image widget there. Then, there is the metadata associated with the widget itself, such as the image URL. This metadata is stored in a JavaScript object as a React prop in Perseus, which means that if we can move that metadata around properly along with the basic text we‚Äôll have what we want. For example, the metadata for an image widget can look something like: \"image 1\": {     \"type\": \"image\",     \"alignment\": \"block\",     \"graded\": true,     \"options\": { ,         \"backgroundImage\": {             \"url\": \"doge.gif\",             \"width\": 537,             \"height\": 529         },         \"labels\": [],         \"alt\": \"\",         \"caption\": \"I am a doge.\"     }, } How can we allow regular copy-pasting of plain text to work correctly as well as handle the case where there are widgets to move around? localStorage to the Rescue Our solution was to listen for cut, copy, and paste events. On a cut / copy, we look through the text for widgets. We grab the associated metadata of each widget we find and save ‚Äôem in localStorage . On a paste, we see if localStorage has some metadata that we‚Äôve previously cut / copied. If so, then pull it in. You can find the basic implementation in this commit . It ended up being just a few lines of JavaScript and I was very pleased with how it worked. One nice bonus from using localStorage was that widgets could be copied over from different web pages entirely. For example, if a content creator wants to move widgets from one question to another, he/she can copy the widgets in one question‚Äôs editor, browse to the page with the other question‚Äôs editor, and paste the widgets in. But Wait‚Ä¶ That commit above gave content creators some basic functionality that saved many frustrating minutes re-entering in widget settings. However, there were a number of issues and edge cases that remained. Can you think of some after looking at that commit? Here are the ones that were most immediately obvious after we deployed this feature: Name conflicts. Ex. pasting an [[‚òÉ image 1]] in a text box that already contained an [[‚òÉ image 1]] . In the commit I linked above, I simply ignore the pasted widget in the case of a name conflict. localStorage data isn‚Äôt cleared after a paste. The original reason for this was that we could conceivably want to paste the same widget in multiple places. However, this means that we could potentially have weird behavior if we paste a widget, then copy text from another website, then paste that text in. Since we still have the metadata in localStorage , we‚Äôll try to move that data into the exercise / article. Suppose we 1. copy some text that contains widgets in Perseus, 2. decide to go to another web page and copy some text from there, and 3. paste that text instead of the original text with widgets. Since step 1 moves metadata into localStorage and when we paste we simply look for the presence of that data, we‚Äôll erroneously pull that metadata in even though the text we‚Äôre actually pasting wasn‚Äôt originally from Perseus. Making Copy-Paste Do More Things Properly I resolved the above issues as follows: Instead of totally ignoring the pasted widget in the event of a name conflict, I rename the widgets safely. For example, if the section already contains a widget called [[‚òÉ image 2]] and I want to paste in widgets [[‚òÉ image 1]] and [[‚òÉ image 2]] , we‚Äôll rename the first widget to [[‚òÉ image 3]] and the second to [[‚òÉ image 4]] . That is, we‚Äôll look at the highest-numbered widget already in the section of the same type and make sure all of the widgets we‚Äôre about to paste in are numbered higher than that one. I clear localStorage after a paste. This saves headache since content creators don‚Äôt really need to paste the same widget everywhere anyway. In addition to saving the metadata in localStorage , I also save the copied plaintext itself. On a paste, I check the text that‚Äôs about to be pasted and only move widget metadata in if the plaintext matches the one previously copied from Perseus. This is a bit strict but ensures that only text from Perseus will trigger widget metadata pasting. These changes are implemented in this follow-up commit. There are almost certainly definitely more weird edge cases but these covered the majority of use cases for content creators. Shipping beats perfection, after all. Our content creators have been loving this feature, and it‚Äôs always a fun one to show others. If you‚Äôd like to try it out for yourself go ahead and check out the Perseus demo!

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Evolving our content infrastructure", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/evolving-our-content-infrastructure/", "abstract": "By William Chargin Every month, millions of learners use Khan¬†Academy in languages other than English. Over the past few years, we‚Äôve built the tools to get our content translated for non-English learners, but the experience has always been far from perfect‚Äîfor both our learners and our translators. Two weeks ago, we hit a major milestone in improving this experience. Khan¬†Academy users in Mexico may have noticed two exciting new things about our website: users on Telcel, Mexico‚Äôs largest cell network, can now access Khan¬†Academy free of data charges on both native apps and es.zero.khanacademy.org , thanks to partnership with the Carlos¬†Slim Foundation and Telcel, and all content on the Spanish-language Khan Academy¬†site should now be available completely in Spanish, with no interspersed English! These are both important milestones for our learners, our engineering team, and our team of translators. In this blog post, I‚Äôll focus on the second one, discussing the infrastructure changes and optimizations that we needed to make in order to achieve this zero-English goal, and how we‚Äôll adapt these changes to more languages. What‚Äôs the problem? Of course, translations aren‚Äôt new to Khan¬†Academy . All our natural language content and all our user interface strings go through a third-party translations service called Crowdin , and we‚Äôve even built extensive tooling to make this as easy as possible for translators. Indeed, our translations are updated many times per day, and our teams around the world translate millions of words monthly to help make Khan¬†Academy available in other languages! Yet, until recently, we continued to have significant portions of our site appearing in English. Though much of this exercise is translated, some crucial parts         remain in English, so the exercise is effectively useless to         non-English learners. (Larger view.) There are two primary sources of untranslated content on our site: new content and changed content. Our content creators work in English, so all new content that they add appears untranslated initially. We‚Äôve long had a solution to this, though: each topic has a set of ‚Äúlisted locales,‚Äù which we use to limit the locales in which we show the enclosed content. We can simply set new content to only be listed in English; then, we can gradually add the content to more and more locales as translators translate it. While this may not be optimal (as it requires manually updating these listed locales whenever translations are completed), it works fine and solves the problem of new content appearing untranslated. The larger problem is changes to existing content that‚Äôs already live on international sites. If we add a section to an article, or introduce some new problem types in an exercise, then those new strings will be visible immediately‚Äîbut they won‚Äôt yet have translations, so they‚Äôll appear in English. Even small changes to existing content and metadata, like removing a space at the end of a video description, or changing a straight quote to a smart quote in an article title, will technically be new strings, so will appear untranslated. This is a pretty big problem, because our content creators publish and update content dozens of times per day, and each publish risks reverting content to English. This wipes away translators‚Äô work, and immediately exposes learners to a language that they may not understand. We‚Äôve been thinking about this for a while, but it is a hard problem. Ideally, we want to give translators the ability to fix a specific version of the site, translate it, and have that version appear live for their translated site. Any further updates from the English site wouldn‚Äôt be visible on the international site until translators decide to translate it, actually translate it, and publish their updates to their site. The first step in implementing this is simply making it possible to display different versions of the content tree on non-English sites. To actually implement this, we needed to make some wide-reaching changes to the infrastructure behind our content system. A bird‚Äôs-eye view of our content architecture Our site runs on top of a custom CMS. To understand the required infrastructural changes, we need to understand a bit of how the CMS works. Each content entity on our site‚Äîvideos, articles, and exercises, and also the topics into which they‚Äôre arranged‚Äîis stored in an immutable Python object, called a Video (etc.). The cache of all these frozen models is stored in memory on each instance, so all requests have essentially instant access to all of our content. For evident reasons, we call this cache the frozen model store , or¬†FMS, and we‚Äôll be coming back to it a¬†lot as it‚Äôs the core data structure for the site! When a content creator makes a change to, say, update the description of a video, we create a new VideoRevision entity on the server; just like the corresponding frozen model, this entity contains all the metadata for the content. The server also sets the ‚Äúediting head‚Äù for the relevant video to point to the new revision, but no changes are made to the frozen model store until the content creator publishes the change. At publish time, we grab the most recent revisions for all the entities that the content creator wants to publish, and all the currently live revisions for everything unchanged (the vast majority). We then go through and create the frozen models for each revision, adding some metadata as we go. The CMS editor view. At left, you can see the structure of the         topics in the content tree. At right, a particular content item         is shown; editing any field will create a new VideoRevision entity. (Larger view.) At this point, we‚Äôve created a new frozen model store for the new version of the site. To update the live site, we simply flip a global setting called last_published_commit , which contains the¬†SHA-1¬†hash of the currently live FMS. At the beginning of every request, each instance will make sure that it has the most recent SHA, and will pull in the latest version of the FMS if it‚Äôs out of date, evicting the old one from its cache. All queries to our content go through the frozen model store, and all relevant caches are keyed against the FMS SHA, so the effect is that the entire site is atomically updated in about a second. If you‚Äôd like to read more, Tom has written about how he designed this CMS and how he implemented it . But all you really need to know for now is that the whole frozen model store is keyed by SHA and stored in a big in-memory cache. The one-line solution There is a conceptually simple way to achieve our goal of freezing a version of the site to appear in Spanish. All we need to do is identify the SHA of the content version that we want to freeze, and then use that SHA in place of the default SHA on the Spanish-language site, by hooking into the global setting. It turns out that this is pretty easy to implement, too. We can simply change our last_published_commit string to a last_published_commits dictionary, mapping each locale to its specific content version (with the semantics that locales not in the dictionary use the English tree). When evicting caches, we just don‚Äôt evict the FMS for any of the currently live versions. This actually works impressively well. Because all content accesses are keyed against the SHA, and the SHA is computed based on the locale, all content accesses are now effectively keyed by locale as well. There were only a few places that needed to be updated further, and these were the codepaths that worked directly with the frozen model store itself (like the content publish process, which sets the global SHA setting, as well as our scripts to prime caches against a new version of the site before it goes live). The fun part, as with any infrastructure work, is in anticipating and dealing with the downstream effects of this change. Memory You‚Äôve probably spotted that this potentially doubles the memory usage of our content system: we‚Äôre now storing two similarly-sized content trees in instance memory. The first question is whether we can handle that at all. Our frozen model store is only about 34¬†megabytes as stored in the datastore, but this is with all entities pickled and the entire store compressed. We cache the decompressed and unpickled form in instance memory, because we demand instant access to content. We checked on our production instances, and found that this came out to 313‚ÄâMB. The App¬†Engine instances that we use only have 512‚ÄâMB of¬†RAM, so we clearly wouldn‚Äôt be able to store two of these in memory at once. It was optimization time. As usual, there was some really low-hanging fruit. We did some memory analysis using Python‚Äôs asizeof library , and saw that articles were taking up a disproportionate amount of space. Upon closer inspection, the cause became clear‚Äîout of videos, exercises, articles, and topics (our four content kinds), articles are the only kind with any non-trivial content stored in the FMS other than metadata. For instance, all of our video content is hosted entirely on¬†YouTube. But we were storing the body of every article as Perseus content in the frozen model store. The frozen model store wasn‚Äôt intended to store this kind of data, but obviously we have to store it somewhere. Our solution was simple: just don‚Äôt store the content in the FMS, and instead delegate to the ArticleRevision from which the Article in the FMS was originally created. This is essentially as simple as adding an @property to the Article class: py @property @request_cache.cache() def perseus_content(self):     # (shadows the old `perseus_content` attribute)     revision = ArticleRevision.get_by_sha(self.sha)     return revision.perseus_content Because our revision types are also immutable, we don‚Äôt lose any atomicity guarantees by doing this. That is, we have an overall SHA for the frozen model store, and each frozen article also has a revision SHA that‚Äôs stored in the FMS; the composition of two frozen SHAs is still a frozen SHA. The major concern here, then, is that the data access is no longer instant. But our request_cache.cache() decorator on the getter above fixes that, by (unsurprisingly) caching the datastore value for the duration of the request. It‚Äôs rare for a request to need to fetch the full content of multiple articles‚Äîusually, you‚Äôre either displaying the metadata for a whole bunch of them in a list, or you‚Äôre actually viewing just a single article‚Äîbut this does happen when we, e.g., traverse the entire content tree. In that case, we can fetch all the relevant data with a multi-get and populate the caches, to avoid degrading to a bunch of sequential, blocking RPCs. So the overall performance hit is at most one RPC per request, which is totally fine; in return, we immediately lopped off about 60‚ÄâMB of memory. As we continued to look at the distribution of data, the long tail fell off quickly, and we ate all the low-hanging fruit without achieving the memory reduction that we were hoping for. A¬†lot of our data was just normal dictionaries containing information that we couldn‚Äôt really see a way to optimize, like lists of problem types that apply to any particular exercise (stored as IDs, so not really compressible). But a closer look revealed that the overhead of these containers themselves‚Äîprimarily Python dict s‚Äîwas a significant contributor to our memory usage! We found that the standard library‚Äôs namedtuple was more memory-efficient, but namedtuple has a different interface‚Äî point.x instead of point['x'] ‚Äîand we didn‚Äôt want to have to update all users (tricky in a dynamically typed codebase!). Also, using a namedtuple would have prevented us from adding or removing fields in a way backward compatible with existing pickled objects; namedtuple s really are just tuples with the names stored on the class object. To solve these, we created a type called a tuplemap , with the following key properties: the interface is like a dict ; memory usage is like a tuple; and when pickled and unpickled, the ordering and naming of fields is flexible, like a dict and unlike collections.namedtuple . If this sounds appealing, we‚Äôre open-sourcing tuplemap , as well as its successor, namedmap , and also their tests, for use in your code today! Go ahead and check ‚Äôem out. By replacing some of our heavier collections with this type, and also interning the strings used as keys when unpickling the objects, we knocked about 120‚ÄâMB off of the frozen model store size. This was sufficient‚Äîwe were good to go on the memory front! The fly in the ointment There was just one tiny catch to all of the above, and it‚Äôs the dirty little secret of the frozen model store: not everything is actually immutable. In addition to the videos, exercises, and articles that power much of our content, we have entire computer programming and computer science curricula. We‚Äôd be remiss to teach these without offering a way for users to create their own programs, and so indeed we do offer programming playground environments, called ‚Äúscratchpads,‚Äù for JavaScript, ProcessingJS, HTML, and SQL. We also use these scratchpads in our official content, both for CS tutorials and as demos and explorations on the rest of the site as well. A demo of scratchpads in action. The live code editing helps         make it a great learning environment for beginners, as you can         change the parameters and watch the output respond in real time. (Larger view.) But these scratchpads are clearly fundamentally different from the rest of our content, in that they can be created by users. When a user creates a scratchpad, we obviously don‚Äôt add it to the frozen model store (we have about 14¬†million of them, for one thing!), and additionally scratchpads‚Äô content is mutable. So when we use a scratchpad as part of our official content tree, the only thing we include in the frozen model store is the scratchpad‚Äôs database key. Consequently, scratchpads can be changed outside of the normal publish process: just clicking the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button on an official scratchpad makes the changes instantly visible to all users. This means that freezing a version of the frozen model store actually isn‚Äôt sufficient to freeze the whole content tree. In an ideal world, we would already have frozen scratchpads to begin with, as a normal part of the content tree and separate from user-generated scratchpads. Perhaps in an ideal world, which is of course free of any ‚Äútime constraints,‚Äù we might have taken this opportunity to introduce such a type. But this would be a pretty large undertaking, cutting across the content infrastructure, the actual content itself (we‚Äôd need to replace the database keys with newly reified scratchpads), the scratchpad viewing interface, and the scratchpad editing interface. We were really hoping that we could avoid undertaking that eight-week project. Instead, we tried to redefine the problem. The underlying issue was that we were worried about English text seeping in to our frozen tree. Most of scratchpads‚Äô content is code, which isn‚Äôt translated anyway, and voiceovers for our ‚Äútalkthrough‚Äù tutorials, which are irrelevant because they‚Äôre not text-based (and they‚Äôre already translated separately). It turned out that the only natural language text in scratchpads boiled down to four fields of metadata: the title, the description, the criteria for peer-evaluating projects, and the suggested ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù after interacting with a scratchpad. So, instead of making scratchpads themselves frozen, we introduced a new entity type: the PartialScratchpad , with just these four properties. Whenever we publish content, we grab the latest version of these natural-language properties from the live scratchpads, and attach them to partial scratchpads. Then, we added more @property s to the main scratchpad model, making them delegate to the PartialScratchpad for official scratchpads, or fall back to the live data for user-generated scratchpads. This was pretty easy to implement, is totally safe, and doesn‚Äôt have any downstream effects to other parts of the codebase. Although it‚Äôs not a perfect solution, it is a step in the right direction; if we do decide to fully freeze scratchpads later, we‚Äôll have a place to start and a way to gradually migrate data. Lessons As usual, this is as much ‚Äúlessons reinforced‚Äù as ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù! But that doesn‚Äôt make them any less valuable. Strive for immutability. Our content system was almost entirely immutable, and patching the part that wasn‚Äôt did not pose a big problem. If we had had to touch every API¬†call that viewed, edited, or published content, or used a cached version of any one of those‚Äîwhich is basically the whole site‚Äîthis process would have taken far longer and have had far more bugs. Identify underlying requirements, then look for 80‚Äì20¬†optimizations. Our approach to scratchpads didn‚Äôt totally fix the underlying problem, but it certainly didn‚Äôt make it any worse, and it totally satisfied our real goal of eliminating all English-language text from the Spanish site. Improving Python memory usage is tricky, but totally possible. With the help of some good tools, we were able to successfully identify the hotspots; with the help of some Python features like __slots__ , we were able to efficiently optimize them. Results and future work Khan¬†Academy‚Äôs Spanish site now successfully uses a different content version than the English site. The servers are able to hold both versions of the content comfortably in memory. We can show and hide content on the Spanish tree independently of the English tree, so we can elect to show content only after it‚Äôs been translated. Moving forward, we have a few major goals. Recall that our original vision was to allow translators to selectively pull in updated content from the English site‚Äîbuilding the frontend and the backend for that system is at the top of our list. Then, we‚Äôll figure out a way to scale this whole system to more than two content trees: clearly, we can‚Äôt just keep reducing the memory usage forever; we‚Äôll need to fundamentally change the way that content is stored and/or accessed. We‚Äôve got some ideas‚Ä¶ Finally, I¬†want to highlight that I‚Äôve used the word¬†‚Äúwe‚Äù an awful lot in this post, and not in the mathematical I-really-mean-‚ÄúI‚Äù sense: this work is due to many of the fantastic people on our infrastructure and frontend teams, of which I‚Äôm honored to be a part.

It‚Äôs exhilarating. It‚Äôs also tricky. Because scaling is hard. This is the first of a set of posts in which we‚Äôll talk about how we‚Äôre managing it at Khan Academy. Like many engineering organizations experiencing rapid growth, we‚Äôve used some standard strategies for scaling over the past two years: Technology and architecture‚Äîleaner and cleaner Decision-making and communication‚Äîbe open, keep it simple, repeat often People and organization‚Äîmake sure the right person is in the right seat Process and tools‚Äîstandard and common across the team These are effective levers, and they‚Äôve been helpful as we‚Äôve grown from a small engineering team to a not-so-small engineering team, moving ever faster and delivering more and more. Stay tuned for more on how we‚Äôve used them. Making the right shifts keeps things running smoothly (Photo by Alok Sharma on Unsplash ) But today‚Äôs post is about what I believe may be the most critical aspect of scaling, the one that really determines how fast and smooth a growth journey will be‚Äîevolving your engineering principles so they support hyperscaling while keeping your culture intact and your team vitally engaged. Getting principles right has an accelerating effect on all other levers of change as well as positive impact on growth and professional development opportunities for engineers. It also results in a sustainable codebase, faster velocity, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîhappy and productive engineers. Khan Academy‚Äôs initial engineering principles were key to the success of our early years as an organization. They reflected the nimbleness necessary in a team bootstrapping a foundation for reaching the vast global community of learners whose lives could be changed with free access to a world-class education. Those initial principles were aimed at removing any barriers to speed. They encouraged, for example, anyone to work on any of the code, anytime. They were effective, and we grew in both impact and team size. We grew a lot. We grew to a size that meant alignment with our original principles was slowing us down. We became more likely to break things and to leave behind clutter in the code. Architectural decisions were made implicitly and on the fly and were not logged. Ultimately our pace of delivery slowed. That‚Äôs when we identified the need to correct course and embarked on a journey of turning things around: it was time to reexamine our engineering principles. Getting principles right has an accelerating effect on all other levers of change We had to refocus on what it takes to build high quality and sustainable code when there are 10 times as many engineers working on the product, when the product has expanded to include test prep (we have over 50% of the market for SAT prep ) and enabling teachers and students in the classroom . And continue to publish more and more world-class content ‚Äì now in more than 40 languages and across more than 370 courses. Here are our updated Khan Academy Engineering Principles. A very thoughtful working group of Khan engineers, architects, and managers focused on what would guide us best in this next phase of our journey. The principles represent how we work together as a community focused on growing a world-class engineering team that delivers on a mission to provide a free world-class education to anyone, anywhere. We champion quality (sometimes we go slow to go fast), we nurture every engineer (everyone learns and everyone grows), and we collaborate compassionately (we work as an efficient team and we treat each other with utmost respect). The principles remind us that the impact we make on our community and on the world should be no less than spectacular. I‚Äôm excited to share our new engineering principles with you. Please read. We‚Äôll continue to unpack them in coming posts. And, we‚Äôll talk more about how the new principles are guiding us through a re-architecture journey and other key foundation strengthening initiatives.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Tips for giving your first code reviews", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/tips-for-giving-your-first-code-reviews/", "abstract": "By Hannah Blumberg At Khan Academy, (nearly) every piece of code that goes into our codebase has been reviewed by at least one other person. Code reviews help us keep code maintainable and clean, catch big-picture issues early, build a shared understanding of the codebase, and socialize new engineers. To learn more about our code review beliefs and practices, check out some oft-cited blog posts here and here . When I joined Khan Academy as an intern, I read a ton of documents describing the purpose, importance, and process of code reviews. Since I was a college student at the time and was accustomed to receiving feedback from professors, I felt prepared to have my code reviewed. I did not feel prepared, however, to begin reviewing code myself. Reviewing other people‚Äôs code ‚Äì especially code written by smart, experienced engineers ‚Äì can be really intimidating. What could I, an intern with just a few computer science courses under my belt, contribute? Now that I have completed my internship and have been full time at Khan Academy for over a year, I know that everyone ‚Äì even the newest of interns ‚Äì can add value to the code review process. To help you get started, here are some concrete suggestions for reviewing code for the first time: 1. Ask questions This is probably my favorite piece of advice for getting started with code reviews. Code review comments do not have to be direct requests for changes. You might ask the author to describe the trade-offs they considered, explain how a piece of code works, or provide more context on the project. Asking questions gives you the opportunity to learn and gives the author the opportunity to articulate, clarify, or challenge their thinking. It may also help the author identify areas of the code that are less clear and consequently harder to maintain. If you find a mistake or identify an area of improvement while doing a code review, you should absolutely feel empowered to share that directly. It‚Äôs easy, though, to second guess yourself, especially when reviewing an experienced engineer‚Äôs code. If you find yourself about to delete a code review comment, try rephrasing it as a question! Asking a question is often just as valuable to the author, and it may feel a little easier to post. 2. Try pair reviewing This is a tip I learned from one of our engineering managers, Celia La. Ask your mentor or onboarding buddy (or anyone else on your team) if they would be willing to do a ‚Äúpair review‚Äù session. You and your teammate can sit together or screen share as you work through a code review together. By watching and asking questions, you can learn more about your teammate‚Äôs process and techniques. If you are not able to set up a pair review session, you can also look at code reviews that your teammates have done for one another. Although you may not learn your teammates‚Äô processes, you will still get a sense of the type of feedback they give one another. 3. Review code in your IDE This tip comes from former engineering lead and my onboarding buddy, Charlie Marsh. In Charlie‚Äôs blog post , he describes the benefits of reviewing code in your own integrated development environment (IDE). At Khan Academy, we typically review code through Phabricator ‚Äòs web interface. The arc patch command allows you to apply the changes in a code review to your local copy of the codebase. From there, you can explore the code in your own IDE. As Charlie describes, reviewing code in your IDE allows you to put yourself ‚Äúin the author‚Äôs shoes‚Äù and catch things you might not see in the web interface. You can navigate more naturally between files and see changes in the context of the codebase. Reviewing code in an IDE also allows you to try out ideas before you share them so that you can suggest changes with more confidence. 4. Comment on anything When you are doing your first few code reviews, you should feel free to comment on anything. For example, you should feel comfortable pointing out small fixes that are not blocking. Although you will likely move away from these comments over time, they can help you build confidence. If you leave ‚Äúnit‚Äù (short for nitpick) level comments, it is best to distinguish them from more crucial fixes. I generally like to add the word ‚Äúnit‚Äù before these comments to communicate to the author that they are not blocking. Borrowing from Ben Kamens‚Äô blog post , you should also feel free to ‚Äúpoint out the good stuff‚Äù in your comments. You might thank the author for a really helpful comment, call out a clever (but clear!) technique, or compliment the thoroughness of their testing. These comments encourage the author to continue doing the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù and help to build relationships. 5. Review a peer‚Äôs code Even if you are a very new or junior engineer, you can add value to any code review. That being said, it can be extra intimidating to review code written by experienced engineers. To become more comfortable and build your confidence, try finding someone who you consider a peer (maybe a fellow intern or someone who started around the same time as you) and ask if they would be interested in having their code reviewed by you and vice versa. Reviewing a peer‚Äôs code can be a more comfortable introduction to code reviews. It will also give you extra opportunities to practice! Keep in mind that you do not need to be the sole reviewer of your peer‚Äôs code; you can leave comments without approving or rejecting the change. Reviewing code is a skill that develops over time. The first step to improving is to just get started!", "date": "2017-09-18"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Switching to Slack", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/switching-to-slack/", "abstract": "By Benjamin Pollack Khan Academy recently made the decision to migrate our team chat from HipChat to Slack. As a team, we‚Äôre incredibly heavy users of ChatOps, and with so many of KA‚Äôs employees working remotely at least a few days a week, all the little details of a chat system can have a very disproportionate impact on the productivity and happiness of our employees. We‚Äôd been experiencing an increasing number of issues with HipChat: we had connectivity problems. We had issues with message delivery. Notifications sometimes just broke. Our remote workers especially just didn‚Äôt feel that chat was something they could rely on, and that meant it was time to find an alternative. From everything we learned, we were increasingly convinced that Slack was probably that alternative. The blocker was that we knew that switching chat systems isn‚Äôt free; we were so bought into the HipChat ecosystem that there was a real cost. (In fact, we had one failed attempt to migrate off HipChat in early 2014, which we had abandoned when the time investment far exceed what we had been prepared to spend.) We needed to make sure we could do the migration in a controlled fashion that minimized the disruption and lost time for the overall team. Okay , I hear some of you ask, but what does it mean to be ‚Äúbought in‚Äù to a  chat system? Why‚Äôs it so hard to leave? Hidden Costs Well, because it‚Äôs never that simple. You‚Äôve got to handle all of the cultural issues: you probably have a lot of rooms that serve special functions, so you‚Äôll want to create equivalents on the new platform. And you‚Äôll also need to update all the documentation saying what rooms are for what purpose, since not all rooms can be named identically. And in the process, you‚Äôre going to find a bunch of rooms whose purposes are dubious, and start having discussion on whether to keep them. You‚Äôve also got social issues. You‚Äôve got contractors who need access to only a piece of the system. You have people who were administrators before, and need to be administrators again‚Äîwhich also means they need to learn how to do administration tasks all over again. You have whole parts of your organization that probably rely on some esoteric feature of the old chat system that doesn‚Äôt exist. And if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be a software shop, you have a whole extra class of problems: integration points. Khan Academy has all kinds of systems that communicate through the chat platform. We had alerting systems that notified HipChat when systems were down or misbehaving, and we had Culture Cow , our Hubot , which did everything from providing regular reminders of how to be a KA employee, to interacting with our code review system, to allowing creating cases in Asana, and more. In fact, our entire deployment system was powered by HipChat. We had a basic plan: a small team of just a couple of developers would begin dual-wielding Slack and HipChat. We‚Äôd then begin porting our integrations over to Slack until everything that happened in HipChat was also mirrored in Slack. Once we were satisfied, we‚Äôd cut everyone over and kill HipChat. The Technical First, we scoured our code base and looked for anything that spoke to HipChat. While it turned out that many code bases talked to it in some way, we were helped by the fact that virtually all alerting at Khan Academy works through an open-source library of ours called alertlib . Thus, right from the bat, we got a lot of mileage simply by teaching alertlib how to speak to Slack, making sure appropriate tokens were installed, redeploying each service, and watching to make sure identical alerts appeared in both systems. If you use alertlib on your own site, grab our updates and you‚Äôll get Slack support basically for free. Most of the remaining instances were our manual integration points with third-party services, like GitHub and Asana. But one of the nice things about Slack‚Äôs ubiquity is that the overwhelming majority of tools that you‚Äôd want alerting in chat already directly support Slack. In many, many cases, we were able to delete or remove entire services, replacing them with some light configuration or a simple plugin. Our Sheepdog service, which powered Asana integration, could be replaced by the Asana Slack commands , Jenkins by the Jenkins Slack plugin , and so on. And because Slack has keyword-based autoresponses built-in, it was really easy to have Slack automatically tell people how commands they were used to had changed. (For example, to respond to messages targeting @all by telling them to use @channel instead.) That pretty much left just the deployment system, Sun Wukong . There were two issues with Sun: first, it held a lot of state internally, meaning that every restart could put it into an odd state, that its idea of the state of the build process didn‚Äôt necessarily match Jenkins‚Äô, and that you couldn‚Äôt run both a copy in HipChat and a copy in Slack at the same time. To add insult to injury, while Sun was nominally built on Hubot, it didn‚Äôt actually use any of the Hubot API for communication; while Hubot runs just fine on Slack‚Äôs API, Sun Wukong most definitely did not. After going through lots of variations on how to approach this problem, we ended up settling on one we really liked. First, we modified our build jobs to publish their job-specific state to a JSON file visible on the build server. Second, using that JSON file combined with the Jenkins API, we modified Sun to rely entirely on the build server‚Äôs view of the world directly. Suddenly, we could launch versions of Sun on both chat systems and drive deployments from either place, giving us an incredibly high degree of confidence that our most critical tool would work fine. As a bonus, the new Sun is actually a simple Slack outgoing webhook , which means you don‚Äôt need to have a continuously running bot‚Äîand, in turn, that we could move everything to just run on an App Engine Managed VM instead of a bespoke box on Amazon. We‚Äôve open-sourced the project in case you want to build on it. At that point, everything worked: if you were on Slack, you‚Äôd get all of the notifications, and could perform all the actions, that you could on HipChat. But what about everything else? The Social First, simply having alerts appear doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre pretty. Slack has a really rich attachment and display system; whereas HipChat uses raw HTML for formatting. So a lot of our alerts looked really ugly and out-of-place on Slack. This is where a few of us using Slack and HipChat at the same time became incredibly useful: we could see alerts come in, identify ones that were particularly ugly, and adjust them long before anyone showed up so that everything looked readable and attractive before people began using the system. We also had to create chat many key chat rooms and adjust permissions before people came over. One unique thing we do at Khan Academy is to keep an alumni room for Elvises who have left the building: we like to stay in touch with everyone who‚Äôs had a hand in making Khan Academy great at what it does, even if they‚Äôve gone on to pursue different things, but we need to keep the alumni out of sensitive rooms so we can preserve confidentiality and security. We had to replicate that in Slack. Second, while Sal is brilliant, he does have limits to his knowledge. Thus, we have lots of contractors who help us cover other subject matter (and sometimes who help us work on specific, niche technology issues). While we obviously want to work closely with these contractors as conveniently as possible, they too should not have unfettered access to the entire Khan Academy chat infrastructure. With HipChat, we actually had to have multiple, separate accounts to handle these use-cases, but Slack gave us a totally new way to approach the problem: restricted accounts , which can access only a subset of rooms and a subset of users. These mapped perfectly to our contractors and alumni, but meant we had to spend some time unifying the two system‚Äôs user lists and accounts. Finally, we simply had to go through and adjust tons of documentation. That process was very straightforward, but took time. On the bright side, since we had new employees starting the same day we planned to do the switch, we knew we‚Äôd have people immediately using our new documentation. The Switch At that point, we were good to go. We declared Monday the official day to jump to Slack. On that day, everyone logged on‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and everything basically just worked. (In fact, the only issue we actually hit was a bug in Slack‚Äôs history importer that we might write about some other time.) The trick with something like this is the same with any other major technical change: if you can possibly run both systems at the same time, do. It makes debugging a lot easier, makes sure you‚Äôre actually handling all the cases of the original tool, and gives you great confidence you can roll back if you do hit an issue. The End Game The move to Slack has been absolutely worth it. Deploys are easier to read, remote employees feel more connected, everyone trusts the chat system a lot more, and integrating with other tools is easier than ever before. And people love the system ‚Äîsomething we‚Äôre hardly the first people to notice . If you‚Äôve been holding off jumping to Slack, follow our guide. It‚Äôs pretty painless and worth the effort.", "date": "2015-11-09"},

Well, talk about rapid scaling ‚Äî within just two weeks in March, Khan Academy site usage grew to 2.5x what it was at the same time last year and has sustained that level to date. As schools all over the world closed because of the coronavirus pandemic and students, parents, and teachers moved to distance learning, Khan Academy was able to respond, offering high-quality content and classroom experience ‚Äî for free. In the month of April, we served 30 million learners on our platform. A recent national survey of parents found that Khan Academy was the ‚Äúmost used online resource‚Äù . I‚Äôm proud that we absorbed this rapid growth without disrupting our users. In addition to reacting quickly to alleviate pressure points within a few days, we had prepared in advance, and that preparation paid dividends. We scaled readily in large part because of our architecture and a rigorous practice of choosing external services carefully and using them properly. So in this post I‚Äôll discuss architectural aspects that play a key role in the scalability of our site. Two fundamental components of our architecture serve us particularly well here. We use Google Cloud , including AppEngine, Datastore, and Memcache, and Fastly CDN , and they were the backbone of the serverless and caching strategy that‚Äôs key to our scalability . Serverless infrastructure Using GCP App Engine, a fully managed environment, means we can scale very easily with virtually no effort. Even with a substantial traffic increase, our site stayed up and performed well, with minimal intervention. We didn‚Äôt need to worry about load balancing ourselves because server instances were brought up as needed without any intervention. We similarly use Datastore which scales out storage and access capacity automatically in much the same way App Engine scales out web server instances. Caching Fastly CDN allows us to cache all static data and minimize server trips. Huge for scalability, it also helps us optimize hosting resources, for which costs grow linearly with usage in our App Engine serverless model. As shown in the architecture diagram, all client requests go through Fastly so we can prevent unnecessary server traffic, improving performance. We load videos primarily from YouTube and secondarily from Fastly. This also keeps costs down as well as ensures that the videos load quickly. In addition to caching static data in Fastly, we also extensively cache common queries, user preferences, and session data, and leverage this to speed up data fetching performance. We use Memcache liberally, in addition to exercising other key best practices around Datastore to ensure quick response times. Our site reliability (SRE) team of course needed to be prepared with ironclad monitoring ‚Äì and we were. We noticed some slowdowns in the first few days and found that deploys were causing those hits. At our request, Google increased our Memcache capacity, and within a week we were comfortable returning to our normal continuous deployment pattern. This speed was critical, as our teams were quickly developing resources to guide new site users in onboarding as easily as possible. Overall, we work hard to choose services carefully, follow best practices, and develop our own as needed. With the right technology, careful preparation, and adjustments on the spot by our amazing engineering team, we‚Äôve been able to serve the students, parents, and teachers who rely on us now more than ever without interruption.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "What do software architects at Khan Academy do?", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/what-do-software-architects-at-khan-academy-do/", "abstract": "By Kevin Dangoor ‚ÄúArchitect‚Äù is a new role in Khan Academy‚Äôs engineering team this year, and my colleague, John , and I have stepped into this role. John has been with Khan for seven years now, mostly focused on frontend development. I‚Äôve just reached three years here, having spent time in frontend development and engineering management. There are many possible paths to this role, and I‚Äôve seen quite a few definitions of it, so I thought I‚Äôd share our view of being an architect. The role of an architect The Wikipedia article about software architects leads with this : A software architect is a software expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms. My view is a subtle shift from that one: an architect acts as a sort of product manager for the system in which software is built . This ‚Äúsystem‚Äù consists of the coding standards, tools, platforms, and even processes used by the engineers on the team to build features for their users. Architects look for ways in which the system can better serve the engineers. The Wikipedia definition describes the architect as ‚Äúmaking‚Äù the design choices and ‚Äúdictating‚Äù the standards. For me, that evokes images of an architect handing a scroll to a messenger who then walks among the engineers declaring, ‚ÄúOn this, the 14th of May, 2018, we hereby decree that all files shall use four spaces for indentation.‚Äù As a product manager for the system, I look out for ways to make things better and then work with the engineers and engineering management to make the changes come to fruition. It‚Äôs a lot more collaboration than it is dictation. That‚Äôs enough vague, high-level talk. Let‚Äôs talk about things that actually consume time in my day. We guide architecture change Though I was joking about the Great Indentation Decree of May 2018, we do need coding standards to help engineers make sense of our system. If you‚Äôve ever been part of a protracted technical argument, you know that these can sometimes be draining and not a productive use of time. At Khan Academy, we‚Äôve adopted DACI as a decision-making framework. DACI stands for Driver, Approver(s), Contributors, Informed and specifies the roles involved in making a decision. The architects and other engineering leaders act as the ‚Äúapprovers‚Äù on architecture changes. You could interpret that as ‚Äúthe architects make the decision,‚Äù which makes this process sound like the ‚Äúdictating change‚Äù approach from Wikipedia, but that‚Äôs not how DACI works. In DACI, the Driver makes sure that the change has the right contributors involved and the Approvers ‚Äúown‚Äù the decision, ensuring that concerns have been accounted for. Are there potential security implications to the change? If so, we‚Äôll make sure our security lead is a contributor. The Driver and Contributors together work out the details of the change and, ideally, the actual decision is self-evident by the end of their work. As the approvers in those cases, architects and other engineering leaders make sure that all of the questions have been resolved. In the cases in which there are two choices, we have to pick one, and the differences between the two are minor, the approver will indeed make the choice. This wasn‚Äôt necessary in the vast majority of cases we‚Äôve seen so far. Every architecture change we make goes into a decision log so that future-us can understand why our system works the way it does, making it easier to understand when it should change again. This process is intentionally designed to be lightweight, so that we can move quickly and efficiently. A simple, uncontroversial change can be written up and approved in a day. What kinds of changes have we made this way? A few recent examples: We‚Äôve adopted rules for how we would deprecate public API endpoints We‚Äôve created standards for React components that we use site-wide We have a second language (Kotlin) that is an acceptable choice for building services Being a part of all of these changes helps architects maintain a broad view of work that‚Äôs happening in our system, which helps us guide further changes to it. Architects help our guilds Khan Academy‚Äôs teams are built around product areas, so we‚Äôve established guilds that look out for our technology across the product areas. We have four guilds currently: web frontend, backend, mobile, and data engineering. Guilds have the ability to influence how a portion of our development time is used, for things like breaking apart our Python code or creating a wholly new set of UI components . John and I help organize the guild work for the frontend and backend guilds, respectively. Communication Architects spend a lot of time on communication tasks to help everyone stay in sync about the current state of our system and how it‚Äôs evolving. Architecture diagrams, roadmaps, project plans, this blog, a newsletter of relevant technology stories, and meetings are all pieces of what we do as architects. The newsletter (see below) helps ensure that everyone in engineering has seen some stories about how technology that affects us is changing. The diagrams, which we‚Äôre creating in part following the C4 model , are a useful tool for communicating about our system. I‚Äôve been working on a proposal for a change to our system and I was able to take pieces out of our diagrams and create new ones that made the step-by-step progression in the proposal much clearer. Code Architects are programmers and John and I both exercise those skills as part of the job. Managers and architects Architects aren‚Äôt typically people managers, and that is the case for both John and me. When it comes to our development process and how projects are going, our managers take the lead. Technical leadership within engineering is shared by architects and managers, with managers taking more responsibility for delivery of the product (the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù) and architects focusing more on the state of the architecture (the ‚Äúhow‚Äù). I spend time each week talking with an engineer on the team to find out how things are working for them. That helps me get a view across the organization of how the system is working, and a cross-cutting perspective I can share with managers when there are things we can improve. PMs for the system I‚Äôm fond of the ‚Äúproduct manager for the system‚Äù definition of software architect. The users of the system are our software engineers, QA, and others who are ultimately working to deliver features for learners, teachers and coaches who use Khan Academy, and we want to help that system deliver better and faster.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Prototyping with Framer", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/prototyping-with-framer/", "abstract": "By Nick Breen We strive to make all of Khan Academy‚Äôs new features & experiences easy to understand and valuable to our users. Watching our users interact and explore new features, which is often called user testing, helps us identify which designs & flows are non-intuitive and could use some improvement. Doing user testing as early as possible is useful because changing designs is significantly easier before the design is passed to the product team to implement and build. In this blog post, you and I will explore how Khan Academy uses prototypes in our user testing and hopefully it will be a great primer for you to start prototyping! Why do we prototype? Prototyping allows our product teams to create a more immersive, often called higher fidelity, product walkthrough experience. Flipping through a set of static design mockups would be less interactive and an example of a lower fidelity experience. Both options are useful and can lead to valuable feedback. Lower fidelity user testing is done first and high fidelity prototypes are utilized later to provide a more immersive, less instructor guided interaction with the feature. A prototype‚Äôs main purpose is to enable our users to interact with new designs which gives us feedback to improve our designs. Each prototype is only seen by the participants of our user test groups and the prototype has a set lifespan since it‚Äôs retired after user testing. This means our prototypes can have a much lower coding standards quality bar than anything we create for KhanAcademy.org, which is commonly referred to as our production environment. This is a good thing, because we can take advantage of different tools to build faster. What tools do we use and why did we pick them? During the prototyping phase of a project the designs will regularly change thanks to all this great user feedback. Our goal with any prototyping is creating and editing new screens as quickly as possible because designs will be tweaked after every user interview. Instead of writing time-intensive, stable code and perfecting CSS styling on all browsers we want to utilize tools that help us create new features quickly with comparable levels of fidelity. There is a large list of prototyping tools that serve different fidelity needs, ranging from piecing together screenshots (ex: Marvel ) to writing stateful prototypes that can integrate with backends (ex: Framer ). Our team has chosen Framer to do our prototyping work for a few reasons: There are many folks at Khan Academy with Framer expertise Framer has wonderful integration with Sketch, which is a design tool our friends in design use Framer allows developers to play to their strengths (writing code) and has a lot of helpers to create functionality quickly. {.align-center width=‚Äù50.0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}‚Äù} Below we‚Äôll offer some great resources to getting started with Framer, but for now we‚Äôre going to keep exploring the philosophy of prototyping. What should I prototype? ‚ÄòDo as little positioning and styling in the prototype as possible‚Äô is a rule of thumb we‚Äôve learned on our prototyping adventures. All the styles and positioning should be done in the design mockups instead of in our prototype‚Äôs code. One of Framer‚Äôs advantages is the ability to easily import Sketch files. This feature instantly imports the exact pixel-perfect position for all the elements, which are also styled exactly as they appear in the designs. On the flip side, we can and should do all state changes in our prototype. The most common state changes in a prototype are: changing text on a page swapping images to denote a correct or incorrect selection showing new content when clicking on a link (example: show me a hint for this question) One of our most interesting issues we solved when learning how to prototype was creating a repeatable and reliable way to change text in your prototype. Our solution had two parts, first we swap the layer containing the text with a new layer which has the new text. Let‚Äôs pretend that second layer has less text on it so it‚Äôs shorter. The second step was to reposition and shrink or grow all the layers below the swapped layer and the parent layers. Since our swapped layer is shorter we‚Äôd reposition those layers higher and shrink them. For a in depth exploration into this problem please see appendix A. What should I NOT prototype? To reiterate, Framer should be used when the prototype needs state-management, like tracking points, or dynamically changing content. We should not be doing substantial design work (Pixel pushing, style updates, etc) in Framer. Remember our mantra: Do design work in mockups instead of in code . There are easier and faster tools if we just want to simply stitch design mockups together (our friends in design prefer Principle). Tabitha, one of our friends on the design team, said it best: ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äôs should only create stateful prototypes, everything else can be done faster and easier without custom code.‚Äù How do I start prototyping with Framer? Framer introduction doc and video Download the free trial of Framer and Sketch How to import sketch documents I have questions Great! Prototyping is all about moving fast and you might find yourself in a undiscovered land! The best place to ask questions is the Framer Facebook group or Stack Overflow FramerJS tag . Closing thoughts Give prototyping a shot and get your designs in front of users! Special Thanks to Emily & Bryan for their help on this article. Appendix A: How do I update sections & text fields that may grow dynamically? As we noted above, one of Framer‚Äôs advantages is the ability to directly import sketch designs. The imported designs are pixel-perfect and each sketch layer is absolute positioned based on the layer‚Äôs x and y coordinates. However, this creates an issue when the prototype is required to dynamically change content and the layer grows or shrinks vertically. Let‚Äôs explain this using an example. We have a prototype that is a question and answer prototype. The main page looks like: {.align-center width=‚Äù100.0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}‚Äù} We want to substitute the question text because each question is different. Also, let‚Äôs pretend our new question text is substantially shorter. Once we swap the text, they‚Äôll be a new large space between the question text and answer prompt, which doesn‚Äôt match our designs. This makes the prototype‚Äôs user experience less authentic, which is bad. We want our prototype‚Äôs user experience to be as authentic as possible. What do we do? We brainstormed and investigated three possible solutions. We‚Äôve outlined them in great detail on Stack Overflow . We‚Äôll now talk about our solution, which is to swap the layer and reposition all the layers below. We wrote some code to: Use TextLayer to create a new layer with the new question text Measure the size difference between the original sketch question text layer and our new TextLayer Resize the parent layers based on the difference calculated in #2 Remove the original sketch layer Insert the new TextLayer in the same x and y coordinates as the original sketch layer For more information on TextLayer, please take a look at it‚Äôs repository . Please note, the function / method I could not get convertToTextLayer to work properly. Appendix B: Performance in Framer Studio If your Framer prototype starts getting above ~1200-1500 lines of code, you‚Äôll likely run into performance issues with text-editing. If that happens, try this: Head over to Terminal, and start a server on your local machine: cd myPrototype.framer/ python -m SimpleHTTPServer Open up a browser window and go to localhost:8000 or whatever URL you got in Terminal. Use a different text editor (like Sublime or Atom or whatever else you have that‚Äôs performant) and fire away! Appendix C: Tips for creating a good Sketch document for importing into Framer The layers/groups should be organized as they are displayed starting from the top going down Unique names for every template and layer are helpful when importing the layers into Framer Every growable text area (description, each answer, etc) should have it‚Äôs own direct parent group", "date": "2016-10-03"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Memcached-Backed Content Infrastructure", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/memcached-backed-content-infrastructure/", "abstract": "By Ben Kraft Last post, I wrote about how we did profiling on App Engine‚Äôs Memcached service to plan our new content-serving infrastructure that will allow us to scale our new content tools to many more languages.  But that was all talk, and at Khan Academy we‚Äôre all about having a bias towards action .  So let‚Äôs talk about how we tested the new backend, rolled it out to users, and the issues we ran into along the way! Recap: Content serving, the old way Tom and William have written about our content infrastructure in the past, but as a quick recap, we have a custom content versioning system that allows content creators to edit the content and then later publish it to the site.  The end goal of that publish process is to build a new version of our content data, which includes a specific version of each item of content (such as a video, exercise, or topic) at Khan Academy.  In most cases, these are stored as a pickled python object with the metadata for a particular piece of content ‚Äì the actual video data is served by YouTube.  The goal of our content serving system is to get all that data out to any frontend servers that need it to display data about that content to users, and then atomically update all of that data when a new version is published.  The frontend servers can then use this content data to find the URL of a video, the prerequisites of an exercise, or all the articles within a topic. In principle, this is a pretty simple problem ‚Äì all we need is a key-value store, mapping (global content version, content ID) pairs to pickled content item objects.  Then we tell all the frontend servers which content version to look for (an interesting problem in and of itself, but outside the scope of this post), and they can fetch whatever data they need.  But that doesn‚Äôt make for very good performance, even if our key-value store is pretty fast.  Even after we cache certain global data, many times we need to look at hundreds of items to render a single request.  For instance, to display a subject page we might have to load various subtopics, individual videos and articles in the subject, exercises reinforcing those concepts, as well as their prerequisites in case students are struggling. In our old system, we solved this problem by simply bundling up all the content data for the entire site, compressing it, loading the entire blob on each server at startup, and then loading a diff from the old version any time the content version changed.  This gave us very fast access to any item at any time.  But it took a lot of memory ‚Äì and even more so as we started to version content separately for separate languages, and thus might have to keep multiple such blobs around, limiting how many languages we could version in this way.  (Between the constraints of App Engine, and the total size of data we wanted to eventually scale to, simply adding more memory wasn‚Äôt a feasible solution.)  So it was time for a new system. Content serving, the new way After discussing a few options, our new plan was fairly simple: store each content item separately in memcache, and fetch it in on-demand, caching some set of frequently used items in memory.  We simulated several caching strategies and determined that choosing a fixed set of items to cache would be a good approach, with some optimizations. We went ahead and implemented the core of the system, including the in-memory cache, and the logging to choose which items to cache.  In order to avoid spurious reloads, we stored each item by a hash of its data; then each server would, after each content update, load the mapping of item IDs to hashes, in order to find the correct version of each item.  We also implemented a switch to allow us to turn the new backend on and off easily, for later testing. Testing & Iterating But things were still pretty darn slow.  It turned out we had a lot of code that made the assumption that content access was instant.  Everywhere we did something of the form py for key in content_keys:     item = get_by_key(key)     # do something with item was a potential performance issue ‚Äì one memcache fetch is pretty fast, but doing dozens or hundreds sequentially adds up.  Rather than trying to find all such pieces of code, we set up a benchmark: we‚Äôd deploy both the old and the new code to separate clusters of test servers, and run some scripts to hit a bunch of common URLs on each version.  By comparing the numbers, we were able to see which routes were slower, and even run a profiler on both versions and compare the output to find the slow code. In many cases, we could just replace the above snippet with something like the following: py content_items = get_many_by_key(content_keys) for item in content_items:     # do something with item This way, while we‚Äôd have to wait for a single memcache fetch that we didn‚Äôt before, at least it would only be a single one.  In some cases, refactoring the code would have been difficult, but we could at least pre-fetch the items we‚Äôd need, and keep them in memory until the end of the request, similarly avoiding a sequential fetch. This was a pretty effective method ‚Äì on our first round of testing, half of the hundred URLs we hit were at least 50{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} slower at the 50th percentile, and khanacademy.org/math was over 7 times slower!  But after several rounds of fixes and new tests, we were able to get the new version faster on average and on most specific URLs.  Unfortunately, this didn‚Äôt cover everything ‚Äì some real user traffic is harder to simulate, and because caching is less effective on test versions with little traffic, there was a lot of noise in our small sample, and so small changes in performance were hard to spot, even if they affected very very popular routes where that small difference would add up. So we moved on to live testing!  Using the switch we had built, we set things up to allow us to more or less instantly change what percentage of our servers were using the new version.  Then we rolled out to around 1{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} of requests.  The first test immediately showed a blind spot in our testing ‚Äì we hadn‚Äôt done sufficient testing of internationalized pages, and there was a showstopper bug in that code, so we had to turn off the test right away.  But with that bug fixed, we ran the next test for several hours on a Friday afternoon.  We still saw a small increase in latency overall; the biggest contributor was a few routes that make up a large fraction of our traffic that got just a little bit slower.  After more improvements, we moved on to longer tests on around 5{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}, then 25{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}.  On the last test, we had enough traffic to extrapolate how the new backend would affect load on memcache, and scale it up accordingly before shipping to all users. Rollout & Future work Finally, we were able to roll out to all users!  Of course, there were still a few small issues after launch, but for the most part things worked pretty well, and our memory usage went down noticeably, as we had hoped.  We still haven‚Äôt rolled out to more languages yet ‚Äì but when the team working on the tooling is ready to do that, we‚Äôll be able to. We do still have some outstanding problems with the new system, which we‚Äôre working to fix.  First, we‚Äôve opened ourselves up to more scaling issues with memcache ‚Äì if we overload the memcache server, causing it to fail to respond to requests, this sometimes causes the frontend servers to query it even more.  Now that we depend on memcache more, these issues are potentially more common and more serious.  And the manifest that lists the hashes of each item in the current content version is still a big pile of data we have to keep around; it‚Äôs not as big as the old content bundle, but we‚Äôd love to make it even smaller, allowing us to scale even more smoothly.  If you‚Äôre interested in helping us solve those problems and many more, well, we‚Äôre hiring !", "date": "2017-05-15"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Creating Query Components with Apollo", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/creating-query-components-with-apollo/", "abstract": "By Brian Genisio Here at Khan Academy, we‚Äôve been using GraphQL in several projects with great success.  GraphQL is a query language for describing the data you want from the backend API.  It is an elegant solution to some of the problems that REST presents, including client performance. Prevailing wisdom in the React/GraphQL space these days suggests that queries be co-located with the components which use them.  We use Apollo as our client abstraction to the GraphQL endpoint such that co-located queries are relatively straightforward to structure, at least for simple cases. As queries and component interactions become more complicated, however, the presentation and query layers become intertwined in a way that can feel overwhelming, especially from a separation of concerns perspective.  Because of this, we‚Äôve started to adopt a pattern we are calling ‚ÄúQuery Components‚Äù.  I‚Äôll explain in more detail later in this post, but a Query Component is a component which abstracts the data definition from the Presentational Component , allowing the Presentational Component to be agnostic of Apollo or GraphQL. Demo code All of the demo code for this post can be found in this Schools repo.  You can play with it live if you‚Äôd like.  There is not a ton of data, but it is an example of searching for schools by postal code.  Some postal codes with data include 48103, 48104, and 48105. It uses GraphCool as the backend GraphQL implementation.  GraphCool is a really great way to experiment with GraphQL without learning how to implement a GraphQL server.  It is a Backend as a Service (BaaS) for implementing a data store with a GraphQL interface. A simple example Let‚Äôs start with a simple example of using Apollo to connect a GraphQL query to a React component.  Here is a Presentational Component which displays a list of all the schools available and a ‚ÄúLoading‚Äù string while we are waiting.  It is purposefully simple and shows how you can describe the data you want and display it with very little ceremony. ‚Äú`jsx import React, {Component} from ‚Äòreact‚Äô; import {graphql} from ‚Äòreact-apollo‚Äô; import gql from ‚Äògraphql-tag‚Äô; class Schools extends Component {     render() {         if (this.props.data.loading) {             return Loading ;         } return {         this.props.data.allSchools.map((school) => {school.display} )} ; } } const SCHOOLS_QUERY = gql query allSchools {   allSchools(orderBy: display_ASC) {     id     postalCode     display   } } ; export default graphql(SCHOOLS_QUERY)(Schools); ‚Äú` A more complicated example Unfortunately, simple examples like the one above are not the common case in practice.  Let‚Äôs see how this expands to be more like what you‚Äôd see in a real application. We‚Äôd like to pass a parameter to the component in order to filter the query by postal code. In addition to the data.loading flag, we‚Äôd like to know when there was an error and we‚Äôd like to know when the query was successful but the result was empty. We‚Äôd like to use Flow types, so we‚Äôll annotate all the types in this component. We‚Äôd like to include PropTypes in the component.  Since we are using Flow we‚Äôll do so via Flow -> React PropTypes . ‚Äú`jsx // @flow import React, {Component} from ‚Äòreact‚Äô; import {graphql} from ‚Äòreact-apollo‚Äô; import gql from ‚Äògraphql-tag‚Äô; type School = {     id: string,     postalCode: string,     display: string, } class Schools extends Component {     props: {         // Provided by the parent component         postalCode: string, // provided by the Apollo wrapper     schools: Array ,     isLoading: boolean,     isEmpty: boolean,     isError: boolean, }  render() {     const {schools, isLoading, isEmpty, isError} = this.props;      if (isLoading) {         return Loading ;     }      if (isEmpty) {         return No items match your postal code ;     }      if (isError) {         return There was an error processing your search ;     }      return {         schools.map((school) => {school.display} )     } ; } } const SCHOOLS_QUERY = gql query allSchools($postalCode: String!) {   allSchools(       orderBy: display_ASC,       filter: {postalCode: $postalCode}   ) {     id     postalCode     display   } } ; type SchoolsData =  {     loading: boolean,     error: string,     allSchools?: Array , }; const mapDataToProps = ({data}: {data: SchoolsData}) => {     const isLoading = data.loading;     const isEmpty = !!data.allSchools && data.allSchools.length === 0;     const isError = !!data.error;     const schools = data.allSchools || []; return {isLoading, isEmpty, isError, schools}; }; const mapPropsToOptions = ({postalCode}) => ({variables: {postalCode}}); export default graphql(SCHOOLS_QUERY, {     options: mapPropsToOptions,     props: mapDataToProps, })(Schools); ‚Äú` Now that we‚Äôve added these features, we have a new set of problems. The original code violates the ‚Äúseparation of concern‚Äù principle but this code is more egregious.  This component is managing the GraphQL/Apollo integration and the presentation at the same time. The properties of the component don‚Äôt properly communicate the intended usage.  The parent needs to provide the postalCode property, but the other required properties ( schools , isLoading , isEmpty , and isError ) are provided by the mapDataToProps function. The actual presentation is tightly coupled to the query and glue logic.  It is not uncommon for the same query to be used for a select component, or a table layout, or some other presentation.  Providing a different presentation isn‚Äôt immediately obvious. Query Components A pattern we‚Äôve liked using lately is something we are calling ‚ÄúQuery Components‚Äù.  Query Components encapsulate the query and Apollo glue logic into one component, which allows it to be composed with a separated Presentational Component. It uses the ‚ÄúFunctions as Children‚Äù pattern.  For more information on this pattern, see Merrick Christensen‚Äôs writeup in Function as Child Components . SchoolsQuery This is a Query Component which encapsulates all of the GraphQL query and the Apollo glue logic.  It doesn‚Äôt have any presentation. ‚Äú`jsx // @flow import gql from ‚Äògraphql-tag‚Äô; import {Component} from ‚Äòreact‚Äô; import {graphql} from ‚Äòreact-apollo‚Äô; export type School = {     id: string,     postalCode: string,     display: string, } type SchoolQueryChildrenFn = (     schools: Array ,     details: {         isLoading: boolean,         isEmpty: boolean,         isError: boolean,     }, ) => React$Element ; class SchoolsQuery extends Component {     props: {         postalCode: string,         children?: SchoolQueryChildrenFn, isLoading: boolean,     isEmpty: boolean,     isError: boolean,     schools: Array , }  static defaultProps = {     isLoading: false,     isEmpty: false,     isError: false,     schools: [], }  render() {     const {isLoading, isEmpty, isError, schools, children} = this.props;      return children && children(schools, {isLoading, isEmpty, isError}); } } const SCHOOLS_QUERY = gql query allSchools($postalCode: String!) {   allSchools(       orderBy: display_ASC,       filter: {postalCode: $postalCode}   ) {     id     postalCode     display   } } ; type SchoolsData =  {     loading: boolean,     error: string,     allSchools?: Array , }; const mapDataToProps = ({data}: {data: SchoolsData}) => {     const isLoading = data.loading;     const isEmpty = !!data.allSchools && data.allSchools.length === 0;     const isError = !!data.error;     const schools = data.allSchools || []; return {isLoading, isEmpty, isError, schools}; }; const mapPropsToOptions = ({postalCode}) => ({variables: {postalCode}}); export default graphql(SCHOOLS_QUERY, {     options: mapPropsToOptions,     props: mapDataToProps, })(SchoolsQuery); ‚Äú` Schools component This is a Presentational Component which composes itself with the Query Component and the presentation.  The interface is clear and the presentation is simple. ‚Äú`jsx // @flow import React, {Component} from ‚Äúreact‚Äù; import SchoolsQuery from ‚Äú./SchoolsQuery.js‚Äù; class Schools extends Component {     props: {         postalCode: string,     } render() {     const {postalCode} = this.props;      return {(schools, {isLoading, isEmpty, isError}) => {             if (isLoading) {                 return Loading ;             }              if (isEmpty) {                 return No items match your postal code ;             }              if (isError) {                 return There was an error processing your search ;             }              return {                 schools.map((school) => {school.display} )             } ;         }} ; } } export default Schools; ‚Äú` Going forward Query Components have been a valuable pattern within our codebase, but they are new to us, and we are still evaluating how the pattern will scale over time.  I expect an abstraction which codifies the pattern will be valuable.  I‚Äôd also like to see how the same concept can be used for other API interfaces.  The same approach would work for more traditional REST interfaces, for example.  Whatever the case, I expect that we will be blogging more about GraphQL in the future. Bonus! This pattern can be applied to GraphQL mutations as well.  By separating the mutation into a Mutation Component, the presentation only needs to activate the mutation.  For the sake of brevity, I won‚Äôt include the implementation here, but you can find it in the demo code . You can compose the Mutation Component with the presentation like this: jsx {triggerMutation => Create! } Loading Loading No items match your postal code There was an error processing your search Loading No items match your postal code There was an error processing your search", "date": "2017-06-12"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Ensuring transaction-safety in Google App Engine", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/ensuring-transaction-safety-in-google-app-engine/", "abstract": "By Craig Silverstein In last week‚Äôs exciting post, I described an alternative to transactions that we use at Khan Academy, to ensure atomic datastore operations. When used correctly, both the user-write lock and transactions are effective at avoiding a particular form of database corruption ‚Äî call it ‚Äùdata stomping.‚Äù Data stomping happens when two requests try to modify the same datastore entity at the same time. {.align-center} Request B does not see A‚Äôs modifications, and its PUT overwrites A‚Äôs PUT. A‚Äôs modifications are entirely lost, even when they don‚Äôt conflict with B‚Äôs. Transactions solve this problem by noticing the contention at request B‚Äôs put() time, and forcing request B to retry from the beginning. Locks solve the problem by not allowing the time-overlap at all. Note that for both techniques, you need to follow the GET - MODIFY - PUT idiom. It is an error ‚Äî a db stomping waiting to happen ‚Äî to do the GET outside the transaction/lock! In this blog post, I describe the infrastructure we put in place at Khan Academy (which uses Google App Engine) to notice that error, and to make it easy to modify the source code to prevent it. We are making the source code available in two files: db_hooks.py : a generic db/ndb hooking infrastructure txn_safety.py : the specific hooks we use to detect and alert for transaction-safety violations How do people use transactions (and locks) wrong? The mistake people make is simple: they do the GET outside the transaction (or lock). Then when the transaction retries, it doesn‚Äôt re-GET, so you end up with request B stomping out request A‚Äôs changes. You may think it‚Äôs easy to remember to always do your GET ‚Äôs inside a transaction, but there are many ways to get this wrong: You do the PUT in a function that‚Äôs far removed from the GET . You are given an entity and forget to run entity = entity.key.get() to ‚Äùre-GET‚Äù inside the transaction There are multiple codepaths used to GET an object, and only some of them ‚Äî maybe the ones used 99{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} of the time, so everything seems mostly-fine ‚Äî are done inside the transaction The get() call gives a cached result This last cause was a big problem for us: we would cache the entity corresponding to the current user, for efficiency. Then, whenever we wanted to update the current user, we‚Äôd do get_current_user().modify().put() inside a transaction, without realizing that get_current_user() was returning some cached entity that was fetched way before the transaction started. The solution is pretty straightforward, once you realize there‚Äôs a problem. The issue is finding out there‚Äôs a problem in the first place, and then tracing through the code to find the problematic GET . A Taxonomy of Data Stomping Errors While the GET-outside-transaction error is the most common, there are many related types of data corruption. The infrastructure we put in place catches the following three types: Stomping :   Doing the PUT inside a transaction or user-lock, but not the GET . ``` {.python} @ndb.transactional def seems_ok_but_is_not(uid):      user_data = UserData.get_from_id(uid)   # cached!      user_data.points += 5      user_data.put() ```  The problem here is that `get_from_user_id()` gets the user-data entity from a cache. So even though it looks like you're doing the GET from within the transaction, you're actually (potentially) just seeing some object that was gotten much earlier in the request, outside this transaction. Totally unprotected stomping :   Doing a GET - MODIFY - PUT entirely outside a transaction or     user-lock. ``` {.python} def badfunc(user_data):      user_data_again = db.get(user_data.key())      user_data_again.points += 5      user_data_again.put() ``` Internal stomping :   Doing two nested (or interleaved) GET - MODIFY - PUT ‚Äôs inside a     single transaction/lock. ``` {.python} @ndb.transactional def _internal_fn(uid):    user_data1 = get_user(uid)    user_data1.points += 5    user_data1.put()  @ndb.transactional def public_fn(uid):    user_data2 = get_user(uid)    user_data2.points += 10    _internal_fn(uid)    user_data2.put() ```  The problem here is that `user_data1` and `user_data2` are totally different python objects. When we do the `user_data2.put()`, it totally overwrites the change made in `user_data1`. This is the classical db-stomping problem, but within a single request! How To Use It To get the benefits of transaction-safety checking, you must annotate a db/ndb model with a decorator saying what method you use to guarantee safe put() ‚Äôs: @never_written_model() ‚Äî super rare! @abstract_model() ‚Äî commonly for polymodels and utility classes @structured_property_model() ‚Äî for (Local)StructuredProperty models @written_once_model() ‚Äî easiest to use correctly (no need for transactions) @written_in_transaction_model() ‚Äî you put get-modify-put in a transaction @written_with_user_lock_model(lockid_fn) ‚Äî you put get-modify-put in a user write lock @written_via_cron_model() ‚Äî appengine lets you schedule cron jobs; if an entity is only accessed via a cron job, we know two requests will never access that entity at the same time @dangerously_written_outside_transaction_model() ‚Äî for legacy code @dangerously_written_outside_transaction_model_or_user_lock() ‚Äî ditto These instruct the transaction-safety system what kinds of violations to look for. There is much more documentation of each choice at the bottom of txn_safety.py . Note that @written_with_user_lock_model takes an argument: that should a be a function that takes an entity and returns the lock_id for that entity. For instance, if the lock is protecting a single user, the lock_id might be the user-id. This is necessary because a single lock can protect many different entities. Example: {.python} @db_decorators.written_with_user_lock_model(lambda e: e.kaid) class UserVideo(db.Model):     \"\"\"A single user's interaction with a single video.\"\"\"     user = db.UserProperty(indexed=True)     kaid = db.StringProperty(indexed=True)   # user's user-id     video_key = object_property.KeyProperty(indexed=True)     ... Second, you have to wrap your WSGI application in the transaction-safety middleware: {.python} app = webapp2.WSGIApplication([...routes...]) app = txn_safety.TransactionSafetyMiddleware(app) Then you just run your application. If there is a transaction-safety violation, the system will log it: ‚Äú` {.} Did a put() of the same entity from two different python objects: .

For power users, the source code documents functions like disable_user_write_lock_checking_in_test() . In the last blog post I mentioned that lock_util.py ‚Äôs fetch_under_user_write_lock could not be used at that time. Well, with the functionality in this blog post, it can be!, making it really easy to re-fetch an entity ‚Äî or not, as needed ‚Äî under the user write lock. {.python} def update_points(user_data):     with fetch_under_user_write_lock(user_data) as ud_again:         ud_again.points += 5 If we are already under the write lock, this is a noop, otherwise it will re-fetch the entity under the lock. It works for both db and ndb entities. How It Works The basic approach of the transaction-safety infrastructure is to annotate every datastore entity with a history of when it was retrieved from the datastore and what the state of the world was at the time: in transaction X, or under user lock Y. At put() time, it examines that history to make sure it‚Äôs in the same transaction or user lock ‚Äî or indeed in any transaction at all ‚Äî and complains if so, giving a traceback of the put() call to help with debugging. It also keeps track of whether the same entity was get() -ed multiple times, which is needed to detect internal stomping. Here is a snippet from txn_safety.py to demonstrate how it works: ‚Äú` {.python} For a newly created entity, we don‚Äôt need a transaction. if not hasattr(entity, ‚Äò ts get nonce‚Äô):     return     # not created via a get() get transaction = getattr(     entity, ‚Äò transaction at request time‚Äô, None) put transaction = _transaction object() if not get transaction and not put transaction: ts violation(‚ÄòDid not use a transaction‚Äô) elif not get transaction:     _ts violation(‚ÄòDid the get() outside a transaction‚Äô) elif not put transaction:     _ts violation(‚ÄòDid the put() outside a transaction‚Äô) elif get transaction != put transaction: ts violation(‚ÄòDid the get() and put() in different txns‚Äô) ‚Äú` The bulk of the complexity is actually in db_hooks.py : the code for adding get-hooks and put-hooks in App Engine db and ndb models. While there is a built-in hook system for ndb , it is not adequate for our purposes because it only hooks [get()]{.title-ref} calls, not queries. And the older db library has no hooks at all. db_hooks.py provides a uniform interface for hooking all functions that get or return entities in both db libraries. Appendix: Non-Data Stomping Errors Data stomping is not the only problems you can run into with db data. Here are 4 cases our infrastructure does not detect. Stale reads : GET + GET - MODIFY - PUT + ``` {.python} @ndb.transactional def goodfunc(user_data):    user_data_again = user_data.key.get()    user_data_again.points += 5    user_data_again.put()  def oopsfunc(user_data):    if should_assign_points:        goodfunc(user_data)    if user_data.points > 100:   # stale read!        ... ```  The problem here is that `goodfunc()` updates `user_data_again`, but leaves `user_data` untouched. So the `user_data.points` read will never see the 5 points you just awarded! Consistency :   Two PUT ‚Äôs that should be in a transaction together. This (not db data stomping) is the traditional motivation for using transactions. If you are modifying both a coach and student to teach each about the other, that should happen inside a transaction. We do nothing to check that you do. Overwrites :   Two new-entity PUT ‚Äôs with the same key at the same time. If request A does `MyModel(key='foo', value=1).put()` and request B does `MyModel(key='foo', value=2).put()`, only one will win and the other will be thrown away.  App Engine provides `get_or_insert()`, which you can use in lieu of `put()` in situations where that is a concern. Note that this is only an issue if you explicitly specify a `key` param. Otherwise, unique keys are assigned automatically, and it's impossible for two new-entity `put()`'s to conflict. Races :   You want A‚Äôs GET - MODIFY - PUT to happen before B‚Äôs, but B goes     before A. API X is a call that gives a user some points. API Y is a call that sees if a user has enough points for a particular badge, and awards it if so. You want to make sure, in your request, that API X is called before API Y. But while our code guarantees those two API's won't update the user-data at the same time, nothing guarantees one request will run first. You have to do that ordering constraint in your own code.", "date": "2016-06-27"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Slicker: A Tool for Moving Things in Python", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/slicker-a-tool-for-moving-things-in-python/", "abstract": "By Ben Kraft Craig talked last post about our project to reorganize our whole Python codebase. This entails a lot of architectural challenges ‚Äì deciding where to put each file, prioritizing which files and classes to split, and so on ‚Äì which Carter will talk about more in the final post of this series. Today, I want to set all that aside to focus on the more mechanical process of moving: what does it take to move thousands of files, classes, and functions, each of which may be referenced by dozens or hundreds of others? We ended up writing a tool called Slicker to do it all, and the remainder of this post talks about why we needed it and how it works. The Problem To understand what we need to do, let‚Äôs start out with a simple application for creating and viewing articles like those on Khan Academy . 1 All these examples are modified from patterns that exist in our real codebase, although they are of course simplified. # models.py from google . appengine . ext import ndb # the ORM we use class Article ( ndb . Model ): author = ndb . StringProperty () def get_article_by_id ( article_id ): return Article . get (...) # views.py import current_user import models def display_article ( id ): a = models . get_article_by_id ( id ) # build some HTML based on `a` def create_article (...): return models . Article ( author = current_user . get (), ...) Maybe we‚Äôre about to add a bunch of other types of content ‚Äì videos , projects , and so on ‚Äì so we want to move models.py to content/article.py . The move itself is easy in this case: no changes to the file are necessary so we just move it. Over in views.py , we need some changes: we need to replace all those calls to models.* with articles.* , and correspondingly import models with from content import articles . Then, to keep our imports nice and sorted, we need to move that changed import up a line. # views.py +from content import article import current_user -import models def display_article(id): -    a = models.get_article_by_id(id) +    a = article.get_article_by_id(id) # build some HTML based on `a`\n \n def create_article(...): -    return models.Article(author=current_user.get(), ...) +    return article.Article(author=current_user.get(), ...) This diff is easy to write manually, but we wanted to do this for thousands of files. How? We started by looking at existing tools. PyCharm ‚Äòs refactoring tools are indeed pretty powerful, but they didn‚Äôt work out for us for several reasons. First, PyCharm doesn‚Äôt do a perfect job of fixing up all the right references. For example, when I tried the above move with PyCharm, it successfully moved the definitions of Article and get_article_by_id to content/article.py , but it didn‚Äôt move the import of ndb ‚Äì it just deleted it. I‚Äôm sure we could work around that particular bug, but it wasn‚Äôt the only one. 2 I think in this case PyCharm gets confused because ndb isn‚Äôt on my PYTHONPATH. (It gets injected elsewhere in our code; some manual configuration could point PyCharm in the right direction.) In another simple case I tried, when moving a function to its own file, PyCharm copied an import to the new file, despite the fact that it wasn‚Äôt used in the moved function. I suspect this has to do with inadequate handling of the first edge case I discuss below. Second, PyCharm didn‚Äôt know about our style guide so we had to further modify most of the imports it added. You might think that would be a quick process, but if PyCharm writes from content.article import Article everywhere (such that the code uses Article unqualified), and we want to change it to use from content import article and reference article.Article , that‚Äôs almost as much work as the original move! Finally, PyCharm‚Äôs refactoring tools can only be used through their IDE interface and are somewhat slow; it was very convenient to be able to git reset and rerun a set of Slicker commands and quickly if we decided to do things a little differently halfway through. Rope , which aims to do something similar but as a plugin for other editors, is more scriptable but otherwise had similar problems. And, surprisingly, that‚Äôs about it: there aren‚Äôt too many more options out there suited to this sort of use case. 3 If you know of others, I‚Äôd love to hear about them ! In comparison to some languages, the Python community doesn‚Äôt seem to have the same quantity and quality of automated code-rewriting tools. The Old Way Left to our own devices, we started off using handwritten Perl and sed scripts, modified for each commit we operated on. For example, in this case, we could have done: git grep -E -l 'models.(Article|get_article_by_id)' \\\n     | xargs sed -i 's/models.(Article|get_article_by_id)/article.1/g' This doesn‚Äôt fix up imports ‚Äì luckily we already had a tool to do some of the work; a few shell ‚Äúone-liners‚Äù would parse our linter‚Äôs output and pass it to fix-includes which would make the requisite changes. And this was a simple case: we were moving the entire file, there was no other file in the codebase with a similar name, the imports we needed to fix all had the same syntax, with no from or as , and they were all at the top of the file, never inside a function. Each of those complications would have required another few scripts, or a bunch of manual fixes. Nothing beats the flexibility of tools like sed for a one-off change, but for similar operations on thousands of files, this strategy isn‚Äôt sustainable. So I started hacking together a script that would do some of the job for us. After a few Friday afternoons, I was using it for all the moves I was doing, with some success. Once it became clear this could make our task much easier, Slicker graduated from a quick hack to a more serious tool, focused on one thing: moving things around in Python codebases. Slicker Slicker follows a similar approach, but is much more precise. It starts by parsing each file‚Äôs imports, checking whether any of them match the thing we want to move. If they do, it searches the entire file for references that use those imports, and if so, updates both import and reference accordingly. It does all of this, across your whole codebase, in a few seconds in most cases. Here‚Äôs a more complicated case: let‚Äôs say we‚Äôve got a bunch of other ways of getting articles, too, and we want to move those to a separate article_getters.py . We ask Slicker to move content.article.get_article_by_id to content.article_getters . Now, what does it need to do? It deletes the definition from content/article.py ‚Äì easy enough ‚Äì and adds it to article_getters.py : # content/article_getters.py def get_article_by_id ( article_id ): return Article . get (...) You may notice a problem here: a NameError: name 'Article' is not defined! We have to add a new import at the top of the new file (e.g. from content import article 4 By default, Slicker tries to match the style of the import it is replacing ‚Äì import a.b.c vs. from a.b import c vs. from . import c ‚Äì but it also has options to prefer one style whenever possible, as we‚Äôve used in this case. At present, it always imports whole modules ( from content import article , not from content.article import Article ) to follow Khan Academy‚Äôs import style , although we would like to add more flexibility there. ) and then replace Article with article.Article : # content/article_getters.py\nfrom content import article\n\ndef get_article_by_id(article_id):\n    return article.Article.get(...) In other cases, we might have had to update references to get_article_by_id elsewhere in article.py , adding an import similarly. Now, with the function itself moved, we need to clean up the references. This time, since the from content import article is still used by create_article , we don‚Äôt remove it; we add from content import article_getters by its side. # views.py\n from content import article +from content import article_getters import current_user\n \n def display_article(id): -    a = article.get_article_by_id(id) +    a = article_getters.get_article_by_id(id) # build some HTML based on `a`\n \n def create_article(...):\n     return article.Article(author=current_user.get(), ...) Slicker encapsulates all of this work in a simple tool so you don‚Äôt have to think about it. 5 Combining this with the tools Craig mentioned , our full workflow has a few more steps. First, we run Slicker to do the move, followed by the pickle-logger generator. Then, run linters and tests and fix issues they uncover, which generally include a bunch of long or misindented lines, and hopefully not too much else. (If you use an autoformatter, it could probably do most of this part.) Next, we send the code out for review. Finally, after code review, we merge from master again, run lint and tests again, and then deploy. Fun Edge Cases Ahh, edge cases. Python is nice, for our purposes, in that it has a fairly simple syntax so we don‚Äôt have to look for many different ways of referring to functions. But it‚Äôs still got plenty of fun edge cases. Some of these, Slicker handles; some, it does something that‚Äôs good enough; some it ignores or warns the user. Here‚Äôs a fun one: if we have two files content/article.py and content/exercise.py , the following is legal Python: import content . article content . exercise . get_exercise_by_name ( 'addition-1' ) Or rather, it‚Äôs legal python as long as content/article.py or some other file that has already been run imports content/exercise.py. Once content.exerciseis loaded, everybody who imported anything from contenthas access to it. Making use of this isn‚Äôt a great pattern ‚Äì one generally doesn‚Äôt write code like the above intentionally ‚Äì but Pyflakes doesn‚Äôt notice , and after a while these sorts of things build up. (We discovered them after a few moves; in many cases things will work just fine until you try to remove content/article.py entirely, at which point the import will fail.) Slicker needs a lot of code dedicated to handling this case. In particular, when we look for which imports in the file could possibly have brought in the symbol you moved, we have to include any import of a module from the same package. We then look for code referencing those imports similar to how we would for a normal import. Another fun case is code like this, common in tests: import mock from content import article @ mock . patch ( 'content.article.get_article_by_id' ) def do_test ( mock_get_article ): a = article . get_article_by_id (...)\n    ... If we move get_article_by_id , we need to update the argument to mock.patch . We knew about this issue from our very first moves, but for a while, we didn‚Äôt even try to fix it ‚Äì string literals are used in many contexts and it‚Äôs hard to know when we should change any given piece of text. But it turns out we can do pretty well: we look for string literals matching the fully-qualified name ( content.article.get_article_by_id ), the name as imported in this file ( article.get_article_by_id ) or the filename ( content/article.py ), looking carefully at what comes before and after to avoid false positives. Furthermore, if the module is toplevel (e.g. views.py ), we only look for its name as an entire string, so that we won‚Äôt try to update the string 'Someone views the page' , but will still update mock.patch('views') . This isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs pretty close, and it‚Äôs a common enough pattern in our codebase to be worth doing. Of course, we‚Äôll miss code that does mock.mock('content.article.get_article_by_%s' % 'id') , but that‚Äôs super rare in comparison. These fixes include docstrings; we also fix up comments in a similar fashion. For another case where we do something imperfect but close enough, suppose you have: from content import article\n\ndef get_article(name):\n    return article.get_by_name(name)  # `article` is an imported module\n\ndef render_article(name):\n    article = get_article(name)\n    return article.render()  # `article` is a local variable Knowing whether article refers to the module (as in the first case) or a variable (as in the second) requires very careful tracing of variable scopes, which we haven‚Äôt yet implemented . We just do the best we can, and often, it‚Äôs good enough. Sometimes we change our code to avoid this pattern entirely; it‚Äôs confusing for humans too. 6 Exactly what we do is beyond the scope of this blog post, but we‚Äôve developed a few patterns. When possible, we try to choose module names that are less likely to cause conflicts. For example, we often use the plural name when it makes sense; users is a much less common variable name than user , in our codebase at least, so it‚Äôs less likely to conflict. On the other hand, sometimes it‚Äôs best to just do the more explicit import; in the above sample import content.article avoids this problem. (In fact, we can ask Slicker to write all the imports it changes that way, with -a NONE .) Lastly, some edge cases are clearly impossible to handle. For example, if you do: from content import article from content import exercise def get_anything_by_id ( content_type , content_id ): if content_type == 'article' : content_module = article else : # content_type == 'exercise' content_module = exercise return content_module . get_by_id ( content_id ) If we want to change the name of article.get_by_id() , but not exercise.get_by_id() , we actually have to do some refactoring here. (In this case, we‚Äôd likely just do article.get_by_id(content_id) in the if , and similarly in the else, which is clearer anyway. Then Slicker could do its work.) Such a refactor isn‚Äôt hard, but it‚Äôs far too complex to do automatically. For these, we don‚Äôt try; where we can, we warn the user. They‚Äôre luckily rare in real code, although not unheard of. Some Parting Thoughts Python is a pretty interesting language to work with for this sort of thing. For one, despite being a fairly mature language generally, and having good tooling support in most respects, automated refactoring remains underexplored. JavaScript, for example, has much more work in this area , perhaps because the language is changing faster so tools are more necessary to keep up. As for the language itself, on the one hand, ‚Äúexplicit is better than implicit‚Äù and ‚Äúsimple is better than complex‚Äù help us out a lot: doing from ... import * is thankfully rare enough to not worry about[^star], as opposed to some languages where it‚Äôs the default. (Things like __import__(a_dynamic_string) that are nearly impossible to handle are even rarer.) Dynamic typing is less of a problem than one might think; it means we can‚Äôt rename methods, but for toplevel functions it‚Äôs not a big deal. (Of course, you do lose the safety net of a type-checker, and must depend only on unit tests.) Most of the difficulties are around the tooling we build upon. The lack of standardized autoformatting does make code generation harder; we have to worry about where we add whitespace, rather than just doing an AST transform and letting Prettier handle the rest. Meanwhile, Python‚Äôs ast and tokenize modules are helpful but they also leave a lot to be desired. (For example they don‚Äôt tell you which AST node corresponds to which token(s); luckily someone else already solved that problem for us.) So we end up having to do more work than we otherwise might. Structuring Slicker‚Äôs code to separate concerns and keep things understandable has also been an interesting challenge. For example, we might like to separate updating references within a file from updating imports. But it turns out deciding what import to add is intimately tied up with the changes we make later in the file, and we can‚Äôt think about one without the other. Similarly, in theory, our layer for doing the actual on-disk file editing ( khodemod.py ) shouldn‚Äôt be Python-specific, but even reading a file in requires looking for the magic coding: utf-8 comment , defaulting to ASCII for Python 2 and UTF-8 for Python 3. Keeping all of this straight in our heads and in code took a lot of refactoring, and it‚Äôs still not as clean as we‚Äôd like. So that‚Äôs Slicker. If you want to know even more of the gory details, or if you think hacking on this sort of things sounds like fun, check it out on GitHub ! We‚Äôre also hiring , if you want to get paid to work on interesting problems like these in support of a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. Otherwise, tune in next week for more on the benefits of reorganizing our codebase with Slicker. Go forth and refactor!

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Automating Highly Similar Translations", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/automating-highly-similar-translations/", "abstract": "By Kevin Barabash Khan Academy is available in 12 languages and is in the process of being  translated into many more.  We also have a lot of content (videos, articles, exercises, etc.) that needs to be translated into all of those languages.  In  order to help translators find the most high priority items to work on we have  a translator dashboard. We recently redesigned this dashboard.  The main goal of this work was to  improve translator efficiency.  We accomplished this by ensuring that the translation status on items was up to date and that items were organized in a way that made sense to translators as opposed to how items were stored in the  database. Old Dashboard New Dashboard In addition to the dashboard, we also created a tool to help with doing the translations themselves.  The tool features different views of our content that translators can quickly switch between depending of their workflow.  It also includes a feature called smart translations which can be used to automate some of the translation work. Before explaining how smart translations works, it‚Äôs helpful to understand the problem it‚Äôs trying to solve. On Khan Academy we have lots of exercises.  Initially we used a tool called khan-exercises to auto generate questions (along with answers and hints).  Over time we noticed limitations in the types of questions that could be auto  generated.  Also, it was difficult for content creators and translators to work  with.  It was eventually replaced with another tool, perseus , which empowers content creators to create specific question variants to make  sure a skill is fully covered instead of auto-generating random ones. As a result we have many exercises with lots of very similar strings that need to be translated, e.g. Simplify $9/12$. Simplify $8/6$. Simplify $15/3$. ... How it works The process can be broken down into the following steps: Group English strings which differ only in places that don‚Äôt contain any natural language text, such as formulas. ‚ÄúSimplify $9/12$ is grouped with ‚ÄúSimplify $8/6$‚Äù but not with ‚ÄúSquare $3/4$‚Äù. Within each group, check to see if any of the English strings are already translated.  If they are, create a template that can be used to translate the rest of the strings in that group.  If we know that ‚ÄúSimplify $9/12$‚Äù translates to ‚ÄúImplifysay $9/12$‚Äù then we can guess that ‚ÄúSimplify $8/6$‚Äù will translated to ‚ÄúImplifysay $8/6$‚Äù. Update the UI to show how many strings in a group can be translated based on the groups that have translation templates. When a user clicks ‚ÄúAdd smart translations‚Äù we use the translation template  to generate suggestions for the untranslated strings in the group. Here‚Äôs a quick video of what a user sees when using smart translations : Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Implementation Details The library that implements the grouping, template creation, and translation generation is available at Khan/translation-assistant . Grouping To better understand the problem let‚Äôs look at an example string: \"Solve for $x$.  $x - 5 = 10$\" This string is made up of some natural language (NL) text and some non-natural language (non-NL) text.  In this case \"Solve for \" and \".  \" are NL text while \"$x$\" and \"$x - 5 = 10$\" are non-NL text. As long as strings only differ by their non-NL text we could use the translation  for one string as a template and then just swap out the non-NL text.  We group  strings by replacing all non-NL text with placeholders, e.g. \"Solve for $x$.  $x - 5 = 10$\" \"Solve for $m$.  $2m + 3 = 7$\" \"Solve for $p$.  $12 = p + 6$\" map to: \"Solve for __MATH__.  __MATH__\" The strings with placeholders are used as keys to a dictionary where each value is an array containing objects that can be used to access the English strings and translated strings as they‚Äôre added. Creating/Applying Templates The translation template contains two things: a translated string with all non-NL text replaced with placeholders a mapping between where each piece of math appears in the translated string  and where it came from in the English string We need this mapping because words can be re-ordered or repeated depending on  the grammar of the target language, e.g. \"Solve for $x$.  $x - 5 = 10$\"  => \"$x$ orfay olvesay $x$.  $x - 5 = 10$\" In this case the template should look like this: {     tmplStr: \"__MATH__ orfay olvesay __MATH__.  __MATH__\",     mapping: [0, 0, 1] } The mapping is somewhat terse, but the index of the array represents which __MATH__ placeholder in the translated is being mapped to which piece of math in the English string to be translated.  In this case the first piece of math should be repeated twice followed by the second piece once. In order to generate a new translation, we just need to extract the bits of math from a new English string (in the same group) and then apply the mapping to  make sure that the math ends up in the right place. \"Solve for $m$.  $2m + 3 = 7$\" => maths = [\"$m$\", \"$2m + 3 = 7$\"]  \"__MATH__ orfay olvesay __MATH__.  __MATH__\", [0, 0, 1] => \"$m$ orfay olvesay $m$.  $2m + 3 = 7$\" Text in Math Some of our content contains NL text inside text{} blocks that are inside  math.  We‚Äôd like to be able to automatically translate the strings within the text{} blocks in the following way: \"Find *red* if $text{red} - 5 = 10$?\" => \"Indfay *edray* fiay $text{edray} - 5 = 10$?\" To do so we have to modify our original approach to differentiate between math  containing text{red} and math containing other text{} .  Instead of  simplify using the English string with NL-text replaced, we include a list of  the strings from within each of the text{} blocks.  The key is actually a  stringified version of the an object that looks like this: {     str: \"Find *red* if __MATH__?\",     texts: [\"red\"] } We also create a mapping between English text{} strings and translated ones. In this case that mapping would look like this: { \"red\": \"edray\" } When the translation assistant is suggesting translations containing text{} blocks it must perform an extra step when replacing the __MATH__ placeholders in the translated string.  It must update the strings within the text{} blocks, e.g. // text to translate \"Find *red* if $2 = 8 - text{red}$?\"  // insert LaTeX into template translation \"Indfay *edray* fiay __MATH__?\" => \"Indfay *edray* fiay $2 = 8 - text{red}$?\"  // replace strings inside of text{} \"Indfay *edray* fiay $2 = 8 - text{red}$?\" => \"Indfay *edray* fiay $2 = 8 - text{edray}$?\" Conclusion Although the examples only contain math, our exercise strings can also contain links to images or widgets placeholders for things like text fields, multiple  choice answers, or interactive graphs. Smart translations handles these  non-NL text items in much the same way. There are some limitations with this approach.  Namely, it doesn‚Äôt handle plurals correctly.  Translators still have to proof read the translations but it definitely takes the tedious busy work of copy/paste out of the equation. Also, if the translator makes a mistake in the initial translation and clicks ‚ÄúAdd smart translations‚Äù that error will be duplicated.  Luckily, it‚Äôs just as easy to fix mistakes as it is to make them. We received lots of positive feedback from our translations on this feature. Here are a couple of quotes from our translators: ‚Ä¶Smart [Translations] helps us a lot (and it is fun to see the progress).  I like to feel real and fast progress, and still have the control over the  strings. They save a lot of time, requiring only a quick proofreading to guarantee  they are correct.", "date": "2016-02-15"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Engineering career development at Khan Academy", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/engineering-career-development-at-khan-academy/", "abstract": "By Ben Eater At Khan Academy, we see ourselves as part of a broader engineering community and just as we aim to open-source much of what we build, we also want to share what we learn while growing and maturing as an engineering team.  We‚Äôve previously shared our Engineering Principles .  Today we‚Äôre releasing our Engineering Career Development guide. We want to share this with the community in the hopes that other engineering teams may find value and give us feedback, just as we‚Äôve used/stolen/gained so much value from Fog Creek , Stack Exchange , Rent the Runway , and others in making our career structures stronger. Why do we care so much about this stuff? Focus on the learner Like many companies, at Khan Academy we have a list of company values that drive what we do and how we do it. Topping our list is ‚ÄúFocus on the learner.‚Äù Perhaps that seems obvious‚Äîwho else would we be building Khan Academy for, if not the learners who use it? We‚Äôre a non-profit, so it‚Äôs not shareholders‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have any. But much of education (non-profit or otherwise) is focused on every stakeholder but the learner. It‚Äôs important we don‚Äôt lose sight of our goal of making the education system better for more than just parents, teachers, or a small set of privileged students. Keep learning Only as continuous learners ourselves can we really empathize with and understand the mind of our learners. Consequently, our second company value is ‚ÄúKeep learning.‚Äù Not surprisingly, there‚Äôs no lack of opportunity to learn at Khan Academy. Apart from all the amazing content we produce for our learners, we love to teach each other too. We‚Äôve had fellow team members teach us everything from bookbinding to cooking to coffee roasting to zumba. But the one thing everyone on our engineering team is continually learning is how to become better engineers. As an engineering manager, I see it as a primary part of my job to support the other people on my team through their individual learning journeys. It‚Äôs pretty neat that by working on that challenge, we get to improve ourselves and simultaneously build even better empathy for our users. Our career development guide is a small piece of that puzzle. But it took us a while to get here. Our career development guide started the way most of these career ladders do‚Äîand for similar reasons: We needed some sort of framework for figuring out how to hire and pay people with different skillsets and impact to the mission, we wanted it to be fair, and we needed to be able to talk about performance and growth. So we copied a lot of stuff from Fog Creek‚Äôs professional ladder and tweaked it a bit to meet our needs. That first version served us reasonably well for about 3 years, but over time we discovered its limitations. The original version described each level with a single paragraph, making it hard for someone to really know what it took to move from one level to the next. As a manager, I had a shared understanding with other managers about what each level meant (or at least I assumed I did) and could give individual guidance to people. But that‚Äôs not good enough. It‚Äôs not good enough for me to be the only one to understand the full career progression and just tell you what the next step is‚Äîeven if I‚Äôm right (which is far from guaranteed). Student agency As we were learning that lesson, it was teaching us the parallel lesson that even if we built the world‚Äôs best personalized learning system with all the fanciest artificial intelligence that always gave perfect recommendations to each of our students, it wouldn‚Äôt be good enough. It turns out that true personalized learning requires more. It requires students to fully understand the path that they‚Äôre on. It requires students to know where they are, where they‚Äôre going, and what steps stand in the middle. Ideally, armed with this understanding, students have the agency to choose their own path. The teacher‚Äôs role is to help students understand and internalize the context, motivate them, reassure them, and give feedback along the way. But it‚Äôs the student who‚Äôs really driving things. Changing the broader education system is going to take a bit more work, but this seemed like something we could try for our engineering team pretty quickly. So about six months ago, we added a ton of additional clarity to our engineering career development guide. We wanted everyone to have a shared understanding of how you grow as an engineer. For example, what skills does it take to become an engineering lead for a major initiative? If that‚Äôs still a few years away and you have trouble ever imagining yourself as a lead, what can you work on now to take a step towards being able to imagine that? We wanted the shared ~understanding that we had as managers to actually be shared by every engineer in the organization. We may never fully meet that goal, but we‚Äôve made a lot of progress. As a manager, I now find myself in a lot more of the kinds of conversations I want to be in. I‚Äôm having a lot fewer prescriptive conversations‚Äîe.g., ‚Äúhere‚Äôs the next thing I think you should work on‚Äù‚Äîand more conversations where I‚Äôm brainstorming possible career arcs with someone who knows how to take the next step and feels empowered to do so. Shipping beats perfection We know this document is still far from perfect. We like to look at the way our team functions the same way we look at everything else we make: Something we constantly iterate on. I‚Äôm hopeful that by sharing this (far from perfect) document, we‚Äôll get some feedback that helps us learn from others outside Khan Academy. Engineering Principles Engineering Career Development Feel free to fork our guide and modify it to use it in your own organization. If you do, please reach out to me and share what you learned!

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Receiving feedback as an intern at Khan Academy", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/receiving-feedback-as-an-intern-at-khan-academy/", "abstract": "By David Wang When my first piece of code was reviewed at Khan Academy, my mentor Dylan prefaced his comments with the following: (Kamens‚Äôs post here , Tom‚Äôs post here ) And to be honest, I chuckled when I read that: I had already expected seeing a bunch of red during my first code review, and if I received a ShipIt on my first go without any comments whatsoever, I would‚Äôve questioned the efficacy of the code review process at the company :). I asked Dylan why he felt the need to open his code review with this lead-in, and he described his experience with his first code review as an intern. It would have been discouraging to receive so much critical feedback all at once, had he not received the same piece of advice. Somewhere in the middle of that conversation, he let me know that the quality of my code had little to do with the quality of my person, and that code critiques != character critiques. This interaction with Dylan led me to wonder about feedback ‚Äì as a whole in addition to code feedback ‚Äì more than once throughout the course of the summer. What is Khan Academy‚Äôs view on giving feedback in general, and giving feedback to interns in particular? Why does it hurt so much to receive criticism, even when it is delivered with the best of intentions? Why is it that we feel we have to tread so carefully when we‚Äôre delivering it? Khan Academy and feedback While every one of these questions can have an entire blog post devoted to each of them, I‚Äôm going to just give a brief overview of what I‚Äôve discovered on all of them here. First, regarding KA‚Äôs view on feedback, after chatting with managers and poring through docs, I discovered a page on the company wiki about developing a feedback culture. Perfect! It said that the company views feedback as a gift:  it‚Äôs given with the best of intentions  it should be considered a positive sign that my colleagues are willing and choose to invest in me (and my development).  All cheesiness aside, I think I‚Äôve come to really appreciate that metaphor as much as that other one about today being a gift . I can pinpoint instances, both in work and in school, where I‚Äôve gotten the impression that people have given up on me. And to be honest, being ignored for me is a much worse feeling than having criticism barraged at me. In addition to this metaphor, KA views a feedback culture as one that is regular / ongoing and 360 degrees, where anyone feels comfortable asking for feedback from anyone else. And for interns? As part of the mentor/menteeship experience at KA, I had weekly 1-on-1s, where I checked in with my mentor and talked about how the last 7 days have been, and whether I was getting what I wanted out of my summer experience. While it‚Äôs acknowledged that these 1-on-1s are a good time to exchange feedback between mentor and mentee, it‚Äôs not always explicitly stated that that is one of the goals. Thus, something I‚Äôm very glad I did was at the end of each 1-on-1, asking for one actionable piece of information that I could change or focus on for the next week. In addition to the weekly 1-on-1s, one thing I‚Äôm glad Khan Academy does is offer a more formal midpoint evaluation for each of its interns. And from the context of a single internship, the midpoint evaluation is (in my opinion) more valuable than the final evaluation: it‚Äôs less a performance evaluation (where we discuss how us interns have performed compared to what has been expected of us) and more a coaching opportunity. By getting recommendations on where we can improve, we can take steps towards playing at a higher level. And if there‚Äôs 6 weeks left to an internship during its midpoint compared with 0 at the end of the internship, the feedback given at the halfway mark allows for greater growth. The process as a whole In general, I‚Äôve often asked myself why receiving feedback is so hard. After introspecting, talking to some folks, and digging around , I think that there are three things at stake: We feel wronged if a piece of feedback seems inaccurate. This leads to a host of possible reactions: we deem the feedback as simply wrong, or maybe we believe that the person giving the feedback has made unfair assumptions about the motivations that drove our behavior. We might reject the feedback because of how we feel about the giver. Perhaps it was unsolicited, perhaps we believe that person doesn‚Äôt have credibility in what they‚Äôre critiquing us on, perhaps the feedback hasn‚Äôt been communicated well, or perhaps we‚Äôre unsure of the intentions of the feedback giver himself. We perceive feedback as a threat: it might cause us to question our relationship with ourselves. One of our core human needs is to be accepted the way we are, and this is so ingrained in us that signs of rejection (through critical feedback, for instance) lead to the same flight-or-flight response in our limbic systems as actual threats to our physical safety. As to treading carefully when giving feedback, I think it‚Äôs a matter of taking the cautious route after briefly taking the perspective of the feedback receiver. We understand how difficult it is to be on the opposite end, and we lean towards a soft approach to make the experience more positive and less stressful. Lastly, I believe that after all this discussion on feedback and constructive criticism, we should not underestimate the value of compliments. Not because they‚Äôre used as part of the ‚Äúfeedback sandwich‚Äù technique to make people more open to feedback, but because it‚Äôs important for us to know when we‚Äôre doing things correctly and what we could be doing more of. To borrow the wise Ben Kamens‚Äôs words , ‚ÄúIf your team isn‚Äôt taking advantage of the chance to also acknowledge good work and the little sparks of genius that pop up here and there, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.‚Äù Takeaways Looking back at my time at KA, I‚Äôm glad that they‚Äôve been willing to throw me in the deep end and hold me accountable for the work I‚Äôve done. During these 12 weeks, I broke part of the site for the greater part of a day, gave a company-wide presentation on social psychology of all things, and helped build a recommendation system for the company hackathon. And in the spirit of growth, I‚Äôm glad that my mentors Dylan and Sergei have encouraged me to try things that are outside of my comfort range, and have provided guidance, support, and feedback across all things technical and non-technical. When people ask me what I learned from my internship or what my most major takeaway was, I tell them the meta lesson I‚Äôve reinforced in myself about learning, which can be described by any of the following synonymous statements: To quote the eloquent David Hu , ‚ÄúAssume you‚Äôre stupid so you can always be learning.‚Äù From Zen Buddhist Shunryu Suzuki on adopting a beginner‚Äôs mindset, ‚ÄúIn the beginner‚Äôs mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert‚Äôs mind there are few.‚Äù With my own words: frame feedback as opportunities for coaching instead of evaluation, and frame mistakes as learning experiences instead of failures. In case you were wondering, Dylan‚Äôs comments to me in my first code review were to write a more descriptive commit message and test plan :). I hope I received the feedback well.", "date": "2015-10-26"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Time Management at Khan Academy", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/time-management-at-khan-academy/", "abstract": "By Multiple Everyone at Khan Academy received a plea recently: I‚Äôm hoping to organize a blog post that joins together stories of how   each of you manage your time, and lessons you‚Äôve learned in your   adventures so far. I‚Äôd love to learn from all of you, and I‚Äôd bet   anything that a ton of other people feel the same way. Here are four of the responses that came in (and stay tuned for the next fortnightly post where you‚Äôll see Oliver‚Äôs full-length response)! Elizabeth Slavitt Each Monday, I make a to-do list in Trello with the most critical tasks I need to complete that week. This post isn‚Äôt about goal-setting, so I won‚Äôt go into too much detail about how I come up with my to-do list here, but on a high level, my weekly to-do list is derived from my yearly plan, which I create based on what I and my team are accountable for delivering to the company. I make a new Trello card for each week and create a checklist for each day of the week. I tend to assign tasks that require long blocks of uninterrupted thinking time to Tuesdays and Wednesdays since I block Tuesday mornings and all day Wednesday for proactive work (no meetings). I also keep a couple hours Monday morning and all of Friday afternoon meeting-free when possible; that way I have time Monday morning to catch up on any emails or respond to any questions or docs that accumulated over the weekend and have time to wrap up any work from the week on Fridays before heading out. After that initial respite Monday morning, the rest of Monday and all of Thursday tend to be filled with meetings, so I don‚Äôt assign tasks that require much uninterrupted work to those days. Whenever I complete a task, I check it off in Trello, which I find quite satisfying :). If I don‚Äôt finish a task I assigned to a particular day by the time I‚Äôm ready to wrap up work in the evening, I move it on Trello to another day that week. I do my best thinking earlier in the day, so I try to do anything that requires me to generate original ideas in the morning or early afternoon and save things like providing feedback on others‚Äô work, helping others make decisions, etc. for later in the day since critiquing others‚Äô work is much easier than generating new work from scratch. I get a lot of email, and I need to be pretty responsive since, as a manager, a big part of my job is helping others do their jobs more effectively; I also work with partner organizations so have to be responsive to their questions and needs as well. I could easily fill all of my working time in my email ‚Äî responding to questions, providing feedback on docs, making decisions, etc. ‚Äî but if I did that, I‚Äôd never make progress on bigger strategic questions or generate new ideas, plans, or processes for the company. In other words, I can‚Äôt ignore my email, but I also can‚Äôt let it dominate me. Here‚Äôs how I try to navigate that balance: Whenever I check my email, I respond immediately to anything I can answer or deal with right away. If something can‚Äôt be dealt with immediately but isn‚Äôt pressing, I use Boomerang to make it disappear from my inbox until a later date. I think of Trello as my proactive to-do list and my email inbox as my reactive to-do list. I try to complete everything on my Trello checklists each day or at least complete everything I set out for the week by Friday afternoon, and the same is true for my ‚Äùreactive‚Äù to-do list: I try to get to inbox zero (no emails) every day or at least by the end of the week. Andy Matuschak This is an important topic, but a broad one: people write books about time management! I‚Äôll stick to two ideas that have particularly helped me. From first principles We‚Äôre all in crunch mode sometimes‚Äîone thing after another, churning through some list of tasks. Time management discussions often focus on this level (what task management system should I use?!), but the most valuable decisions and corrections I make are at higher fields of view. Good time management doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm not using that time to do what‚Äôs important. As a first step: beyond the tasks on my list, what are the projects and outcomes I‚Äôm currently working towards? Do any need to be nudged along or rescoped? Have any become some kind of zombie that‚Äôs never going to end? Critically: are there projects missing given my areas of focus and responsibility? I generally review this level every Monday morning. Then: I have to periodically review those areas of focus and responsibility. Given my couple-year goals, am I focusing on the right spheres in my life? Are my accountabilities working for my goals or against them? In the last couple years, I‚Äôve often found myself answering ‚Äùno‚Äù here, and that‚Äôs driven valuable evolution of my role at Khan Academy. Reviewed less frequently, but crucially: given the vision I‚Äôm pursuing in my life, do I have the right couple-year goals? Or even higher: does that current vision align with what I consider to be my purpose? (Thankfully, that last one changes less frequently). For example, my professed purpose is ‚Äùexpand the reach of human knowledge and ability‚Äù; my current vision is ‚Äùdo that by making powerful ideas more learnable and by helping more people become life-long learners‚Äù; my couple-year goals on that path are to establish a successful research practice while supporting others in picking off lower-hanging fruit in the space. For now, at least, these answers seem reasonably well aligned, but that‚Äôs only because I often review my work from first principles in the way I‚Äôve described. That vigilance is essential: I‚Äôve certainly thrown out plenty of older answers to these questions. Reliability without anxiety Reliability is a hallmark of professionalism. It helps organizations scale because it allows work to be truly handed off. I can rest easy knowing that a reliable colleague will either complete their work as expected or will raise warning flags early if that won‚Äôt happen. As my responsibilities multiply, anxiety often accompanies my quest for reliability‚Äînot because the actual work is too difficult, but because I‚Äôm constantly afraid I‚Äôm forgetting something that‚Äôs going to screw me . Peace of mind here comes from a trusted source of truth. What are all my obligations? All of them? This isn‚Äôt so hard in principle: get a task manager; do weekly ‚Äùmental sweeps‚Äù to add everything that‚Äôs missing; sleep easy. But such a list quickly stops being a trusted source of truth because it‚Äôs overwhelming and anxiety-inducing in itself! I might notice myself wincing away from it in the morning, letting my eyes glaze over the sprawling contents, only pretending to study it instead of thoughtfully prioritizing. Then when that really important task comes in, I won‚Äôt simply add it to the list because I don‚Äôt trust myself to reliably prioritize and complete work from it anymore‚Äîinstead, I write it on the whiteboard behind me, or use a sticky note, or start another list‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs clear I‚Äôve failed! The hard part about making a ‚Äùtrusted source of truth‚Äù is the ‚Äùtrusted‚Äù bit. I find trust requires regular maintenance: reviewing my tasks often to ensure that they‚Äôre actionable and relevant; delegating, deferring, and removing tasks which I‚Äôm not going to complete; slicing and filtering so that I‚Äôm only seeing usable information. I have to watch my own reaction when something important comes up, and when I feel wary of my own source of truth, I dig to find out why. Reliability doesn‚Äôt stop at the task level. As our scope increases, we become responsible not only for completing all our projects reliably, but also for choosing the right projects in the first place , and so on, all the way up the reflection ladder discussed in the previous section. One defining attribute of successful executive and senior executive roles is reliability at the couple-year-goal through vision levels. But first, my notes tell me this essay is due tomorrow‚Ä¶ [These ideas perhaps primarily adapted from practices I learned from David Allen‚Äôs ‚ÄùGetting Things Done‚Äù, influenced by Tim Urban, Merlin Mann, and various others.] David Hu I work from 9:30 ‚Äì 6:30 I start by journalling 1 page on: why, what, and how. I come up with 1 ‚Äúwildly important goal‚Äù that I schedule my day around. I spend 10 mins on my morning checklist ‚Äî scheduling the day, checking calendar, quick check of Slack, status update. I‚Äôll spend two solid 2-hour blocks, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon, on the wildly important goal. I close Slack and email during this time. Sometimes, I‚Äôll go to a cafe too. I use the Pomodoro technique ‚Äî 25 min working, 5 min break. I meditate during breaks to calm and re-center. I keep a spreadsheet of how focused I was on each Pomodoro work session. I ask my manager to look at that spreadsheet each week to keep me accountable. I spend 5-10 mins at end of day reflecting ‚Äî what I‚Äôm happy about, what I‚Äôm worried about. John Sullivan Responsibilities pile up after you‚Äôre at a company for a little while. I‚Äôve been working at Khan Academy for a couple years, so regardless of the project I‚Äôm on, there‚Äôs always unrelated things competing for my attention. My system for dealing with this is dead simple, and fairly effective: between 2 PM to 6 PM every day I work on my current project only, and I strongly resist any attempts at pulling me away from that work. Outside of that 2-6 block, I let myself be distracted by anything else that‚Äôs demanding my attention. {.align-center width=‚Äù50.0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}‚Äù} This lets me estimate my projects more effectively (I know each day is going to be 4 hours of focussed work on the project, no less, and probably not much more), and also allows me to be pretty trustworthy when I say ‚ÄùI‚Äôm busy and can‚Äôt do that right now, but I‚Äôll take a look at it tomorrow morning‚Äù.", "date": "2016-07-25"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Kanbanning the LearnStorm Dev Process", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/kanbanning-the-learnstorm-dev-process/", "abstract": "By Kevin Dangoor In his New Employee‚Äôs Primer post from July, Riley Shaw wrote a little about our T eams I nitiatives P rojects (TIP) style of thinking about our development work. Here‚Äôs a quick summary of TIP: Teams represent areas of deep domain expertise like mobile, design, data science, Initiatives are cross-functional, multi-project efforts that the organization believes are worth a significant investment, and Projects are specific pieces of work that are scoped to take 2-5 weeks for 1-3 people. A five-week, three-person project is substantial, so that gives you an idea of where an initiative starts in terms of scope. TIP was adopted in February, so 2015 is the first year in which we‚Äôve had initiatives. We don‚Äôt have a specific process that each initiative uses to manage itself, which gives each initiative the freedom to figure out its best path forward. LearnStorm I‚Äôm working on the LearnStorm initiative. LearnStorm is a math challenge for students in 3rd-12th grades (and the Irish equivalents) in the Bay Area, Chicago, Idaho and Ireland. This initiative includes a collection of features that we‚Äôre building into Khan Academy and a large amount of work from our programs team to organize things like helping teachers register students and in-person events. There are a bunch of us working over several months to make this challenge the best it can be. Our initial development process When we started development at the beginning of September, we used an approach similar to what other initiatives were doing at the time: we imagined the initiative as a collection of projects. We had rough ideas about how long each project would take and put the projects on a first draft timeline in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. We also had a Trello board that we used to show the projects in progress and the projects that were coming up. This was a useful way to think about the project at this early stage, but it didn‚Äôt take long for us to start feeling limitations in how we could adapt our plans to handle new information. Around the beginning of November, we switched from a general ‚Äúworking on projects‚Äù mode to a ‚Äúneed to launch signups‚Äù mode. It became important to track many small and medium sized tasks that needed to be done before we could open up signups. Over a crazy few days we moved from Trello checklists to a Google Doc and finally to a list in Asana. That was a bumpy time. Smoothing the process for the second phase LearnStorm is different from other Khan Academy initiatives to date in that we have some hard deadlines. The challenge will start January 29th, 2016 for example. When it comes to getting a project out, there‚Äôs the idea that you‚Äôve got three levers to play with: scope, time and resources. For LearnStorm, the time is fixed. We also have the whole team in place that we‚Äôre going to have, so the resources lever is also fixed (plus: Mythical Man-Month ). Scope is the only thing we have to play with in making sure that the challenge is ready on time. Two to five week-long projects can contain quite a bit of scope and don‚Äôt lay that scope out in a way that makes it easy to choose between alternatives. Larger projects also make it harder to change priorities as we learn new things about the project. What if there was a process that allowed us to easily see how the project is progressing and reprioritize features based on new information? Enter Kanban I had experience with Kanban in the past and thought it seemed like a good fit for our needs. Here is Wikipedia‚Äôs description of Kanban for software development: Kanban is a method for managing knowledge work with an emphasis on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members. In this approach, the process, from definition of a task to its delivery to the customer, is displayed for participants to see. Team members pull work from a queue. Just-in-time delivery of the most important work is what makes Kanban work well for us. Each work item that we put into our queue in Trello is no more than a few days long. If needed, the priorities for the whole team can be changed in just a few days without interrupting the work that‚Äôs already in progress. Plus, these small work items also provide a lot of choices for prioritization. When working through a couple of big features, there might be pieces of each that are lower priority and might be skipped entirely. But where‚Äôs the big picture? Since the beginning of the initiative, we‚Äôve been having regular retrospectives to improve how we work. We recently had our first retro since moving to Kanban and there was a lot of positive feedback. Developers on the team found the process of grabbing the next work item and running with it to be a good way to focus on the most important work. The flip side is that it‚Äôs hard to see the big picture progress we‚Äôre making on the overall project. We think a partial fix for this is easy: just make a document or diagram that groups the cards on the Kanban board with the overall project goals that they‚Äôre bringing to life. I say that this is a partial fix, because there is a tradeoff in adopting small units of work as we have. It‚Äôs much easier to see how 5 bigger projects become a whole than 25 smaller work items. And some of those small work items may never even be done. Choice of tools We write automated tests and try things out along the way, but we‚Äôre still planning to have a focused testing and bug fixing period at the end of the project. When we were getting ready to launch signups, Asana‚Äôs straightforward list view worked well for rapidly collecting and sorting all of the feedback we got from the testers. I‚Äôve found it much harder to work with Trello boards that have a large number of items on them, so we‚Äôll probably switch back to Asana for that phase at the end of the Initiative. Trello and Asana store similar kinds of data, but the views and UI features make a huge difference in how you approach and use the tools. Unsurprisingly, people have used their APIs to present different views on top of the same data, but we haven‚Äôt explored those third party tools yet. Pick a process and improve Kanban is not the ‚Äúone process to rule them all‚Äù. In fact, Kanban isn‚Äôt  a single process at all, but rather a way to think about and evolve the process you have. Continuous improvement is the name of the game, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been going for. Our use of Kanban has helped us to collect, visualize and work on the most important things as our initiative evolves.", "date": "2015-12-07"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "i18nize-templates: Internationalization After the Fact", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/i18nize-templates-internationalization-after-the-fact/", "abstract": "By Craig Silverstein Khan Academy started as a collection of videos, but now has over 100,000 pieces of written content, from exercises to articles to programming challenges . All of these are now available in multiple languages. But the Khan Academy codebase was originally written to be English-only. We had to retrofit the codebase to support internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of written content after a lot of infrastructure was already in place. As most guides to i18n and l10n will tell you, life is much happier if you design for them before the fact. This was not an option for us. The task was made more difficult by the variety of technologies we‚Äôve used over the years. We use 5 different HTML-rendering technologies: jinja2 (for our Python server code) react (for our modern JavaScript code) raw JavaScript (for older JavaScript code) handlebars (for HTML that has to be rendered via both Python and JavaScript) Python (for our very old Python server code, which just wrote HTML directly from source) and all of them needed to be converted to add i18n markup. i18nize-templates There are plenty of tools out there to handle the actual translation of strings; we use Babel and Jed . And there are plenty of services out there to manage the actual translation of strings; we use Crowdin . What is lacking is a tool that will mark up all the natural language text in your code and templates; this is the process that determines what text to show to translators. For this task, we developed i18nize-templates , a tool for finding natural language text in a variety of templating languages, and automatically munging it to be i18n-aware. ::: {.label} sample input (jinja2) : ::: ‚Äú` {.html} Badges ‚Äú`  ::: {.label} **sample output**: :::  ‚Äú` {.html} {{ _(‚ÄúBadges‚Äù) }} ‚Äú`  ::: {.label} **sample input (handlebars)**: :::  ‚Äú` {.html} From the author: {{{ discussionFormControls ‚ÄúPost feedback‚Äù }}} ‚Äú`  ::: {.label} **sample output**: :::  ‚Äú` {.html} {{#_}}From the author:{{/_}} {{#_}}{{{ discussionFormControls ‚ÄúPost feedback‚Äù }}}{{/_}} ‚Äú`  i18nize-templates isn‚Äôt magic: it can‚Äôt convert `item{#if n != 1#}s{#endif}` to the proper ngettext call. But it can reduce the time needed to annotate templates by over 90{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}.  i18nize-templates can convert raw HTML, jinja2 templates, and handlebars templates. (Due to similarities between jinja2 and django, it may also support django templates, though this is untested.) It can also convert text files written using jinja2 or handlebars.  Using i18nize-templates =======================  We are pleased to announce i18nize-templates as an open source Python module. You can install i18nize-templates via  ‚Äú` {.sh} $ pip install i18nize-templates ‚Äú`  Rewriting templates ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  ‚Äú` {.sh} $ pip install i18nize-templates  $ echo ‚ÄúHello {{world}}!‚Äù | i18nize-templates i18nizing ‚Äì {{ _(‚ÄúHello {8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}(world)s!‚Äù, world=world) }}  $ echo ‚ÄúHello {{world}}!‚Äù | i18nize-templates ‚Äìhandlebars i18nizing ‚Äì {{#_}}Hello {{world}}!{{/_}} ‚Äú`  Extracting natural language text ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì  You can also just use i18nize-templates as a Python library to easily extract runs of natural language text from HTML and templated-HTML (or templated-text) documents. Here‚Äôs a Python snippet we use to fake-translate our website into our testing language, called box-language ( ):  ‚Äú` {.python} import re import i18nize_templates  def translate_to_boxes(jinja2_file_contents):     def parser_callback(s, segment_separates_nltext):         if s is None:             return ‚Äù               # called at end-of-parse         elif (segment_separates_nltext               or (s.startswith(‚Äò{{‚Äò) and s.endswith(‚Äò}}‚Äô))               or (s.startswith(‚Äò‚Äò))):             return s   # do not translate         else:             return re.sub(r‚Äôw‚Äô, u‚Äôu25a1‚Ä≤, s)  # alnum -> box      parser = i18nize_templates.Jinja2HtmlLexer(parser_callback)     return parser.parse(jinaj2_file_contents) ‚Äú`  Extracting JavaScript ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  Sometimes, i18nize-templates is useful just because it knows how to parse templated HTML. For instance, for some of our code, we need to extract JavaScript (inside ` ```  (Each template language has its own parser, of course, but these parsers are not suitable for text rewriting of the type we are attempting here, since they parse into an AST but do not provide a way to get from the AST back to a textual representation.)  For this reason, i18nize-templates implements its own lexers, one that can handle raw HTML, one that can handle jinja2-annotated HTML, and one that can handle that handlebars-annotated HTML. They are all based on the Python standard library module `markupbase`, which is what the standard libarary class `HTMLParser` is based on.  We did not base the lexer on HTMLParser directly, since it was too difficult to subclass for the template-specific lexers. This also allowed for some simplifications: we don't parse out HTML entities, for instance.  The lexers call a user-provided callback function for every 'element' that they see. There are only a few different types of elements:  -   An HTML tag -   A run of text between HTML tags -   A template variable (`{{variable}}` in jinja2) -   A template comment (`{#comment#}` in jinja2) -   A template block construct (`{{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}block construct{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}}...{{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}endblock{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}}` in     jinja2)  The main role of the lexer, besides tokenizing the input into elements, is to categorize each element as either **separating natural language text** or **not separating natural language text**.  This concept is closely related to the HTML distinction between block and inline elements. If you have (somewhat ill-formed) HTML like the following:  ``` {.html} This is what I like to do:   md5-026f27c4aa80a61e63ea135333148e50   ```  You want to present the translator with four different strings to translate: \"This is what I like to do\" (probably you don't want to include the colon); \"Go to the movies\"; \"Read books\"; \"Sleep a lot \". You don't want to present the translator with that entire block of HTML as just one giant string to translate.  In this example, the ` ` and ` ` tags **separate** blocks of natural language text into semantically distinct blocks that can (and should) be translated separately. The ` ` and ` `, on the other hand, do not; we don't want to tell the translator to translate \"Sleep a\" and \"lot\" separately!  When making a callback on an element, the i18nize-templates lexers say whether that element separates natural language text or not.  Note that while related to the concept of HTML inline elements, the implementation of natural language text separation is slightly different, due to the semantics of some of the HTML tags. For instance, ` ` is an inline element, but we consider it to separate natural language text (\"nltext\") because text inside a textarea is semantically separate from the text before and after it. Likewise, we special case ` ` to separate natural language text, since semantically it's used by HTML authors as a synonym for ` `.  The rules for whether an element separates natural language text are subtle in the details but simple in broad outline:  -   **An HTML tag**: yes for block elements, no for inline elements -   **A run of text between HTML tags**: no, by definition; but yes     inside cdata sections like `", "date": "2015-09-28"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Go + Services = One Goliath Project", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/", "abstract": "By Kevin Dangoor Go + Services = One Goliath Project Khan Academy is embarking on a huge effort to rebuild our server software on a more modern stack in Go. At Khan Academy, we don‚Äôt shy away from a challenge. After all, we‚Äôre a non-profit with a mission to provide a ‚Äúfree world-class education to anyone, anywhere‚Äù. Challenges don‚Äôt get much bigger than that. Our mission requires us to create and maintain software to provide tools which help teachers and coaches who work with students, and a personalized learning experience both in and out of school. Millions of people rely on our servers each month to provide a wide variety of features we‚Äôve built up over the past ten years. Ten years is a long time in technology! We chose Python as our backend server language and it has been a productive choice for us. Of course, ten years ago we chose Python 2 because Python 3 was still very new and not well supported. The Python 2 end-of-life Now, in 2019, Python 3 versions are dominant and the Python Software Foundation has said that Python 2 reaches its official end-of-life on January 1, 2020 , so that they can focus their limited time fully on the future. Undoubtedly, there are still millions of lines of Python 2 out there, but the truth is undeniable: Python 2 is on its way out. Moving from Python 2 to 3 is not an easy task. Beyond that hurdle, which has been widely written about elsewhere, we also have a bunch of other APIs in libraries we use which have undergone huge changes. All of these differences mean that we‚Äôd have to split our code to run in at least two services (the old Python 2 codebase and the Python 3 replacement) which can coexist during the transition. For all of that work, we‚Äôd receive these benefits: Likely a 10-15% boost in backend server code performance Python 3‚Äôs language features Other languages Given all of the work required and the relatively small benefits, we wanted to consider other options. We started using Kotlin for specific jobs within Khan Academy a year ago . Its performance benefits have saved us money, which we can apply in other ways to help people around the world learn. If we moved from Python to a language that is an order of magnitude faster, we can both improve how responsive our site is * and *decrease our server costs dramatically. Moving to Kotlin was an appealing alternative. While we were at it, we decided to dig deeper into other options. Looking at the languages that have first-class support in Google App Engine, another serious contender appeared: Go. Kotlin is a very expressive language with an impressive set of features. Go, on the other hand, offers simplicity and consistency. The Go team is focused on making a language which helps teams reliably ship software over the long-term. As individuals writing code, we can iterate faster due to Go‚Äôs lightning quick compile times . Also, members of our team have years of experience and muscle memory built around many different editors. Go is better supported than Kotlin by a broad range of editors . Finally, we ran a bunch of tests around performance and found that Go and Kotlin (on the JVM) perform similarly, with Kotlin being perhaps a few percent ahead. Go, however, used a lot less memory, which means that it can scale down to smaller instances. We still like Python, but the dramatic performance difference which Go brings to us is too big to ignore, and we think we‚Äôll be able to better support a system running on Go over the years . Moving to Go will undeniably be more effort than moving to Python 3, but the performance win alone makes it worth it. From monolith to services With a few exceptions, our servers have historically all run the same code and can respond to a request for any part of Khan Academy. We use separate services for storing data and managing caches, but the logic for any request can be easily traced through our code and is the same regardless of which server responds. When a function calls another in a program, those calls are extremely reliable and very fast. This is a fundamental advantage of monoliths. Once you break up your logic into services, you‚Äôre putting slower, more fragile boundaries between parts of your code . You also have to consider how, exactly, that communication is going to happen. Do you put a publish/subscribe bus in between? Make direct HTTP or gRPC calls? Dispatch via some gateway? Even recognizing this added complexity, we‚Äôre breaking up our monolith into services . There‚Äôs an element of necessity to it, because new Go code would have to run in a separate process at least from our existing Python. The added complexity of services is balanced by a number of big benefits: By having more services which can be deployed independently, deployment and test runs can move more quickly for a single service, which means engineers will be able to spend less of their time on deployment activities. It also means they‚Äôll be able to get changes out more quickly when needed. We can have more confidence that a problem with a deployment will have a limited impact on other parts of the site. By having separate services, we can also choose the right kinds of instances and hosting configuration needed for each service, which helps to optimize both performance and cost. We posted a series of blog posts ( part 1 , part 2 , part 3 ) about how we had performed a significant refactoring of our Python code, drawing boundaries and creating constraints around which code could import which other code. Those boundaries provided a starting point for thinking about how we‚Äôd break our code into services. Craig Silverstein and Ben Kraft led an effort to figure out an initial set of services and how we would need to accommodate the boundaries between them. In our current monolith, code is free to read and update any data models it needs to. To keep things sane, we made some rules around data access from services, but that‚Äôs a topic for another day. Cleaning house Ten years is a long time in technology. GraphQL didn‚Äôt exist in 2009, and two years ago we decided to migrate all of our HTTP GET APIs to GraphQL , later deciding to also adopt GraphQL mutations. We adopted React just after it was introduced , and it has spread to much of our web frontend. Google Cloud has grown in breadth of features. Server architectures have moved in the direction of independently deployable services . Ten years is also a long time for a product. We have introduced an incredible number of features , some of which have very little usage today. Some of our older features were built with patterns that we no longer think fit our best practices. We‚Äôre going to do a lot of housecleaning in Python. We‚Äôre very aware of the second-system effect and our goal with this work is not to ‚Äúcreate the perfect system‚Äù but rather to make it easier to port to Go. We started some of these technical migrations earlier, and some of them will continue on past the point at which our system is running in Go, but the end result will be more modern and coherent. We‚Äôll only generate web pages via React server side rendering, eliminating the Jinja server-side templating we‚Äôve been using We‚Äôll use GraphQL federation to dispatch requests to our services (and to our legacy Python code during the transition) Where we need to offer REST endpoints, we‚Äôll do so through a gateway that converts the request to GraphQL We will rely more heavily on Fastly, our CDN provider, to enable more requests to be served quickly, closer to our users, and without requiring our server infrastructure to handle the request at all We‚Äôre going to deprecate some largely unused, outdated features that are an ongoing maintenance burden and would slow down our path forward There are other things we might want to fix, but we‚Äôre making choices that ultimately will help us complete the project more quickly and safely. What‚Äôs not changing Everything I‚Äôve described to this point is a huge amount of change, but there is a lot that we‚Äôre not changing. As much as possible, we‚Äôre going to port our logic straight from Python to Go, just making sure the code looks like idiomatic Go when it‚Äôs done. We‚Äôve been using Google App Engine since day 1, and it has worked well for us and scaled automatically as we‚Äôve grown. So, we‚Äôre going to keep using App Engine for our new Go services. We‚Äôre using Google Cloud Datastore as our database for the site, which is also staying the same. This also applies to the variety of other Google Cloud service we use, which have been performing well and scaling with our needs. The plan As of December 2019, we have our first few Go services running in production behind an Apollo GraphQL gateway. These services are pretty small today, because the way we‚Äôre doing the migration is very incremental. This incremental switchover is another good topic to talk about on another day (subscribe to our RSS feed or our Twitter account to read new posts as they go live). For us, 2020 is going to be filled with technical challenge and opportunity : Converting a large Python monolith to GraphQL-based services in Go. We‚Äôre excited about this project, which we‚Äôve named Goliath (you can probably imagine all of the ‚ÄúGo-‚Äù names we considered!). It‚Äôs a once in a decade opportunity to take a revolutionary step forward, and a big example of how we live our ‚ÄúWe champion quality‚Äù engineering principle . Update: Want to read more about how we‚Äôre doing the incremental migration? Take a look at our follow-up post about side-by-side testing .

We love Python for a lot of reasons ‚Äî most notably the language‚Äôs readability and concision. On the other hand, we have some engineering problems we‚Äôre having trouble solving with Python 2.7: parts of our site are very slow, and our hosting costs are skyrocketing due both to increased traffic and the new features we‚Äôre adding to make the best possible learning experience. As part of our 2018 healthy hackathon , I decided to test what it would look like to serve some user-facing requests using a Kotlin -based application running on App Engine Flex . (Kotlin is a modern, statically typed, compiled programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine.) After seeing some very positive efficiency results, and having had a positive developer experience during the hackathon, we decided to go ahead and adopt Kotlin as a second language for server-side development at Khan Academy. The rest of this blog post will take you through what went into the hackathon experiment, why we chose Kotlin, the results of the experiment, the challenges we faced, and what‚Äôs the future of Kotlin at Khan Academy. Experimenting with Kotlin during the hackathon: a service for analytics events If you‚Äôve ever watched your browser‚Äôs devtools while you‚Äôre clicking around khanacademy.org, you might see a bunch of requests to /api/internal/.../mark_conversions . This is our API for recording analytics events from web clients. We collect data such as how many times a person has attempted to solve a particular exercise and how that person navigates around the site. We use these data, for example, to ensure that a redesign of the subjects menu hasn‚Äôt accidentally made it impossible to find things on the site, or to verify that changes to our exercises based on the latest external pedagogy research actually helped students learn better. The API‚Äôs implementation is pretty simple: it parses out information from the JSON the client sends us, adds extra information from the HTTP headers (for instance, whether it was a phone or a desktop computer), and then sends the information to Google‚Äôs BigQuery , our analytics warehouse. Despite being so simple, this API endpoint had recently climbed to account for more than 10% of our total server costs. We hypothesized this was due to a relatively high per-request overhead. (This API serves a very large number of very small requests.) We wondered how much we could improve our costs if we wrote a separate service optimized for serving just this one API endpoint. Enter Kotlin, which we‚Äôd used for a previous experiment with microservices at Khan Academy. (We‚Äôve also used it for some of our internal tools.) We‚Äôd found it to be both very fast and fairly pleasant to work with. We decided to proceed with writing a Kotlin service to serve this one API, direct traffic to the new API, and compare the number of servers we needed before and after the transition. Interlude: why Kotlin? To be frank, our Python code has a lot of room for optimization within Python, so why start over in a new language? Adding an additional language means there‚Äôs a lot of new developer training, mental overhead due to switching between languages, and infrastructure code that needs to be written twice. To be clear, our goal is not to rewrite the entire Khan Academy site in Kotlin (or any other language). ( Code rewrites can often be disastrous .) Instead, we want to be able to take a few critical (or costly) parts of our codebase and optimize them to the extreme. But there was a sense, especially on the infrastructure team, that we were sometimes being limited by our tools. When picking a new language to complement Python, our most important requirement was that we could use existing Google cloud libraries, since we run almost entirely on Google‚Äôs cloud infrastructure. This limited us to the languages that Google cloud officially supports ‚Äî Python, Java, C#, Go, Node.js, and a couple others ‚Äî or a language that can easily use libraries for these platforms. We landed on Kotlin because it has excellent interoperability with Java, and it‚Äôs very different from Python in several ways that let us better optimize a piece of code according to its requirements: Insofar as it‚Äôs possible to make general statements about a language‚Äôs performance, Kotlin is fast, while Python is‚Ä¶ not. Kotlin has a static, yet expressive type system; Python is dynamically typed. We don‚Äôt necessarily think static typing is always a win: in some situations static typing with a well-designed type system can help developers write code that has fewer errors and is easier to refactor, while in other situations it can decrease developer productivity by making code that would have worked fine anyway unnecessarily hard to read. But now we can choose static or dynamic typing based on a the requirements on a given piece of code. Kotlin code conventionally uses a functional/immutable style, whereas Python conventionally uses a more imperative style. Each style has a place, but having both Python and Kotlin gives us a choice here too. Kotlin (on the JVM) supports true parallelism within a single process, whereas Python (in the CPython implementation available to us) does not, due to the global interpreter lock. This gives us more flexibility to do asynchronous background processing, or to serve more requests simultaneously. The implementation To test, we set up a new service running on App Engine Flex, based upon a minimal Ubuntu image with OpenJDK 8, into which we compiled a small web application based on the Spark web framework . This application reimplemented the single API endpoint we wanted to port, along with a bunch of supporting middleware for things like Khan-compatible authentication and request annotations for analytics. The result was actually a fair bit of code, so we didn‚Äôt want to switch everyone over at once. In order to allow this gradual transition, we passed down a feature flag to our client-side code that chose on a per-person basis whether to use the old Python version of the API or the new Kotlin version. By controlling the percentage of people for whom the feature flag was set, we could gradually roll out to more people. We initially rolled out to Khan Academy staff only, and when that looked ok, we rolled out to 5% of people for a few days, and then gradually upped that to everyone over the course of another day. All in all this went relatively smoothly, though there were a few hiccups that we‚Äôll discuss further in a moment. Results Because our old Python API was running on a set of multithreaded instances (virtual servers) that were concurrently serving a bunch of other APIs, it was not straightforward to directly compare the cost and performance of the old version to the new one. Instead, we looked at our peak daytime instance counts before and after the rollout to estimate how many instances were required to serve all the API traffic on the two versions. After the rollout, the module serving our Python API requests peaked at requiring around 400 instances fewer than it needed before the rollout, and the Kotlin module (serving only this one API) stayed below 50 instances, meaning that one of our Kotlin instances is able to serve roughly 10x the requests that the Python version could serve. In addition, because the particular App Engine Flex instances we‚Äôre using are about 4x cheaper than the (App Engine Standard) Python instances we used before, this represents even more than a 10x cost savings on this route for us. Challenges During the rollout, we did encounter some unexpected challenges. The most interesting was maintaining backwards compatibility of the data we were recording for analytics. While we knew this would be an issue and wrote unit tests for our code to make sure this was as close as possible, there were some subtle differences our tests didn‚Äôt catch that caused issues. An example of this was small changes in user agent parsing: we couldn‚Äôt use exactly the same library for user agent parsing in Python and Kotlin, and there were small differences in how they converted user agent strings into device and browser information. Uncaught user agent parsing differences propagated into our analytics code for calculating learning sessions ‚Äî if you switch devices, we start counting a new session ‚Äî which in turn propagated into the code that calculates total time spent learning. Total learning time is one of a few key metrics we use to evaluate how new features we deploy are affecting learning on the site; it‚Äôs very important to keep it consistent over time, and at first our rollout didn‚Äôt do that. How did these differences slip through the cracks? While many of them did not, and were caught either by manual cross-browser testing or by automated tests, testing didn‚Äôt find all of them. To catch issues that tests may not, we also have monitoring for step changes in our key metrics that alert people to the possibility of bugs being deployed. Even with this monitoring, it took us a while to notice the user agent differences because we happened to deploy the new Kotlin service during one of a few common weeks for spring break in the US public school system, so the overall changes in our traffic patterns masked the issues caused by the rollout. It‚Äôs still an active area of effort to come up with better ways to monitor and test our key queries for analytics. A few years ago, we developed tinyquery , a Python library that‚Äôs an in-memory test stub for Google‚Äôs BigQuery. While tinyquery is very helpful for us, it still relies on us having generated and used test fixture data that is up-to-date and contains enough variety to detect any issues. The data engineering team at Khan is thinking about better ways to generate or sample fixture data for our key metrics, as well as additional query monitoring tools, and hopefully you‚Äôll hear from us in a future blog post about our efforts here. The future Adding and maintaining another language in our codebase is no small effort. We‚Äôve built up a lot of shared knowledge, practices, and tooling around our Python code, and we largely have to start from scratch with Kotlin. But we think it‚Äôs worth the effort because the performance and cost gains can be very significant. For our learners, a faster site translates directly to less time spent waiting and more time spent learning. For us, a less expensive site means less money spent running inefficient code and more money spent on making the best possible learning experience. 1 Reminder: we‚Äôre a non-profit, and you can [donate]( https://www.khanacademy.org/donate ) if you want to help us achieve our mission of a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. What‚Äôs up next for Kotlin at Khan Academy? First and foremost, learning! We‚Äôre compiling resources and guides internally to help people onboard to Kotlin programming. We‚Äôre setting up starter projects in Kotlin to help people learn with hands-on experience in bite-sized pieces. And our analytics, content creation, and internationalization teams are trying Kotlin for some of their internal tooling, giving us experience with medium-sized projects with relatively isolated codebases. In parallel, continued efforts to untangle and refactor our existing Python codebase will yield more isolated APIs that are easier to port to Kotlin if and when the time comes to do so. All in all, with Kotlin we now have another great tool available at Khan Academy for writing the best software we possibly can, in order to provide the best possible experience for our learners.", "date": "2018-06-28"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "No cheating allowed!!", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/no-cheating-allowed/", "abstract": "By Phillip Lemons The problem Recently, a number of students on Khan Academy found a way to cheat by taking hints offline and not having them counted towards their online profile. When going through exercises on Khan Academy you answer the problems given to you and receive feedback on whether your answer was correct or incorrect. If you get stuck on a problem you are able to take hints and have that problem counted as incorrect. Check out this exercise if you want to try it yourself. The images below show the user getting a correct answer and taking a hint respectively. {.align-center width=‚Äù100.0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}‚Äù} {.align-center width=‚Äù100.0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}‚Äù} The cheaters realized that if they disconnected from the internet, took the hints, and reconnected, they would still have a problem counted as correct. Taking offline hints worked this way because our servers expect a request from the client when users take a hint or answer a problem. If the users were disconnected from the internet the server would never see the request and the request was not stored anywhere on the client so it would be lost. How did we fix this? In order to address the offline cheating, we decided to change how the client sends requests to the server. By utilizing the client‚Äôs local storage, we could store failed requests to be retried once the user reconnected to the internet. This solution has the added benefit of removing the need for the client to be connected to the server all the time. Users with a spotty internet connection would have a better experience because everything would work even if the internet cut out for a short period of time. In our new architecture, anytime a user performs an action a string representing that action is stored in a queue that is saved to localstorage. When the queue is consumed, each action is mapped to a function that implements the action. This approach allows us to have more control over what happens when a request is not received by the server. The new queue retries any actions that fail and implements a linear backoff function so as not to be constantly sending requests when the user is not connected to the internet. Below is an image that shows the old architecture (left) and the new architecture (right). If the old client never received a response from the server the request would never be retried. In the new architecture the request is retried until it reaches the server and we get a response. {.align-center width=‚Äù100.0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}‚Äù} A nice consequence of this architecture is that it can be generalized to work in other parts of our system. Code that deals with sending requests to the server can be updated to use this architecture and work more consistently even with a bad internet connection. Supporting an offline mode also becomes a possibility because you can just save all of the actions the user makes and send them to the server at a later time when the user has reconnected to the internet. The downside One of the biggest downsides with this implementation is that with some editing of the user‚Äôs local storage, a hint request can be erased from the action queue. We decided this was acceptable for a couple of reasons. First, our typical classroom user is unlikely to know how to edit their local storage. Second, even if the user edits their local storage, it is visually obvious to those in the same room that they are up to something. A teacher can easily see students messing around with the chrome devtools and act accordingly. Conclusion A client based architecture makes for a much better user experience because a spotty connection does not create a barrier to using our application. In our case, it also made it much harder to cheat on exercise problems and was a great way to make server requests more reliable. Additionally, this architecture makes having an offline mode more feasible.", "date": "2015-08-17"},

One day, we decided to do something about it: namely, move a bunch of files around. It took us two months. This blog post is first in a series describing the Great Khan Academy Python Refactor of 2017 And Also 2018. In this post, I‚Äôll explain where our codebase went wrong, what we wanted to do to fix it, and why it was so difficult. It will include tips and code that others can use to avoid some of this difficulty themselves. The second post will describe Slicker, a tool we wrote which formed the backbone of our refactoring effort. The third post will describe how we used this refactoring as an opportunity to reduce inter-file dependencies within our codebase, and how that benefited us. So what was wrong with our codebase? Take your pick: 1) We had files named parent.py , coaches/parent.py , users/parent.py , and api/internal/parent.py , all holding different bits of logic pertaining to parents of students on Khan Academy. 2) We had a method named login.login.Login.login . (If you‚Äôre wondering, this method was part of the login process.) 3) Our top-level directory had 234 python files in it. More than 10% of our codebase was in our root directory. Not surprisingly, those files were not very related to each other. There were low level utility files like ip_util.py . There were weird specialized utilities like dismissed_items.py . There was application logic like activity_summary.py , and dev-only tools like appengine_stats.py . Oh, there were also 93 Python subdirectories. (Plus a few more for non-Python code.) While the root directory was overstuffed, 30 of these subdirectories contained 5 files or less. Now all our parent-related code is in two Python files. (One for the API and one for everything else.) The login method is now called login.handlers.ka_login.login_and_set_current . And there are half as many Python subdirectories as before, and 1/20th (!) as many Python files in the root directory. How did it all go wrong? The glib answer is: bit by bit. People created new subdirectories thinking they would turn into major projects, but they didn‚Äôt. Or they would create a new file and put it in the root directory because the closest analogue was at the root level. Eventually the problems fed on themselves. When you can‚Äôt find existing code relevant to what you‚Äôre doing, you write new code in a new file. And when the organization of the codebase makes no sense ‚Äî when it doesn‚Äôt relate to the company‚Äôs current products or organizational structure ‚Äî you have no good place to put your new file so you put it somewhere arbitrary. Without anyone ‚Äùowning‚Äù the structure of the codebase, it never got any pruning or reshaping. What did we do about it? Khan Academy set aside 6 weeks at the end of 2017 for the entire company to work on paying down technical debt, and three of us decided to use that time to whip (the Python portion of) our codebase into shape. 1 We focused on Python because the Javascript code was already fairly well organized: the better organized JS code is, the more compact the bundles that users download, and the faster the user experience. Thus, JS code gets cleaned up as part of performance projects, while Python code does not. We started with the subdirectories. One of our senior engineers, familiar with most of the codebase, decided on a preliminary list of directories we would have. Some of these reflected our products, such as test_prep or translation . Others reflected our major data structures and workflows, such as coaches or login . Some reflected lower-level infrastructure, such as email or pubsub . They then spent two days bucketing every file in our codebase into one of these directories. A few dozen files defied categorization and were marked TODO. After this rough cut the real work began. Another group went through every file in the codebase again, and recategorized as appropriate. During this process, directories went away and were added, were split and merged. Files would end up moved somewhere else after more careful examination. Often, files were slated to be broken up, since they held unrelated pieces of functionality. (Some particularly large files were split up into 4 different directories!) There were no shortcuts here; in this step we scanned through almost every line of code in the codebase. The most interesting result of this step of the process is how we rethought some parts of our codebase. For instance, historically our emails directory knew about every type of email we could ever send a user. As part of this analysis, we realized the code would be cleaner if only the email-sending framework lived in emails (now renamed email ), and each specific email lived with the code most appropriate to it (SAT-related emails in sat , new-user emails in login , etc.) Similarly, we moved our API handlers out of a single api directory and into their relevant project directories. Both organizations have their merits, but we had fallen into one of them by default. This process made us think about these alternatives explicitly. Once we knew what files we wanted to go where, we used slicker to do the actual moving. It works as a smarter mv , not only renaming the file but also fixing all imports as well as references in comments and strings (such as mock.patch('path.to.symbol') .) It can also move individual functions and classes from one file to another, which we used to split up files. Why was this hard? Code review . While slicker worked very well, there were enough ambiguous cases that every change had to be carefully reviewed. For instance, we renamed feeds.py to content_render/rss/feeds.py . Now consider code like this: _MODULE_WHITELIST = ['feeds', ...]\nuser_data['feeds'] = _get_feeds_for_user() In the first case we want to rewrite feeds to content_render.rss.feeds , but in the second case we don‚Äôt. There is no way an automated tool can know this, so we depended on code review (and, of course, tests). I spent entire days doing nothing but code reviews. Merge conflicts . This was the most unexpected time-sink. We expected merge conflicts with people who were actually working on our codebase while we did the moves, and coordinated carefully with our co-workers to minimize those. But we did not expect all the merge conflicts we had with ourselves. While we thought we would be able to do many renames in parallel, when we tried it we got tons of merge conflicts. This is because whenever you move a file, you change import statements in other files. If somefile.py has both import foo and import bar , and you rename foo.py while I rename bar.py , then we‚Äôre both editing somefile.py . Whoever lands their changes second has to merge in the other change. Unfortunately, import statements tend to be clumped together, and git treats these two changes as a conflict (even though they‚Äôre really not). Each such conflict has to be resolved by hand. Resolving merge conflicts took longer ‚Äìsometimes significantly longer ‚Äî than actually creating the commit in the first place. Implicit dependencies on directory structure . We had plenty of files that would do things like datafile = os.path.join(__file__, '..', 'testdata', 'whatever') . With the reorganization this code broke. Fixing all of these was tedious. Pickling . When the pickle library pickles a class or a function, it does so by full name: path.to.module.myfunc . If the class or function moves, you can no longer unpickle the data. While complaints about pickle are nothing new, there is no getting around this particular problem: if you want to store the name of a function in persistent storage so you can call it later, you need some way of saying what that function is. And in fact, we need to do just that for AppEngine‚Äôs useful deferred-execution library, which we use a lot. And all those uses were slated to break when we moved files around. Enter pickle_util. This is a wrapper around pickle that we use in Khan Academy code, that lets you register symbol renames. When the pickle_util unpickler finds a class, function, or other symbol that it cannot import, it checks a look-up table for the symbol‚Äôs new location. It then tries to import the symbol from there instead. This lets you transparently unpickle symbols even after they have moved. The source code is easy to adapt for your own use (works with both pickle and cPickle, but it‚Äôs only tested on python2). But we had a problem: we didn‚Äôt know what symbols we needed to register with pickle_util, because we don‚Äôt have any master list of which functions and classes might be pickled somewhere. We *could* just register every single symbol in our codebase with pickle_util, but that‚Äôs unwieldy and slow. So instead we used another solution: pickle guards. A pickle guard is a ‚Äùforwarding file‚Äù we create whenever we move a file to a new location. The pickle guard file lives at the old location and just imports files from the new location. This forwarding file should never be imported by our code (since all references should go to the new location now), but it will still be imported by pickle when unpickling symbols that reference that old location. So we have it log a message whenever it‚Äôs imported saying ‚Äùpickle is using a symbol from this file!‚Äù We can then examine our logs to see places we need to register symbols with pickle_util. Once the logs are all clear, we can delete the pickle-guard files and have a nice, clean codebase. Here‚Äôs an example pickle-guard file for when we renamed google_analytics.py to analytics/google_analytics.py : logging . error ( \"Should not be importing %s, \" \"update pickle_util.py\" , __file__ ) from analytics . google_analytics import _construct_event_payload # NoQA: F401 from analytics . google_analytics import _fix_payload_unicode # NoQA: F401 from analytics . google_analytics import _send_event_to_ga_sync # NoQA: F401 from analytics . google_analytics import google_analytics_user_id # NoQA: F401 from analytics . google_analytics import mark_ga_activation # NoQA: F401 from analytics . google_analytics import send_event_to_ga # NoQA: F401 We created pickle-guard files whenever we moved a file. The code to automate that is here . What did we get right? What did we get wrong? We did a lot of things right, I think. We were smart to figure out exactly what we were going to do before we started doing it; the mechanics of the moves were intricate enough without having to keep in mind the semantics as well. And we were smart not try to do all this in a single ‚Äùflag day‚Äù, where nobody could work on the core product while we did the move, with the goal of avoiding merge conflicts. We considered it, but flag days, however tempting, are never a good idea. And they would not have been here. There were so many unexpected gotchas that it would have been more like a flag month. By planning from the beginning to work around others‚Äô schedules, we were able to mostly avoid merge conflicts with other developers while not blocking anyone‚Äôs work. However, in retrospect I wish we had invested more in a tool to automatically resolve merge conflicts with each other, so we didn‚Äôt have to continually fix up import blocks. It was time consuming and error prone, and probably could have been automated. I also wish we had generated pickle guards in a separate commit from the one that moved the file around. As it is, we did all of it together, and now git does not recognize our file moves as moves. Instead, it sees that we edited google_analytics.py a lot (getting rid of the old content and replacing it with the pickle-guard content) and created a new, seemingly unrelated, file called analytics/google_analytics.py . Now git blame and git log do not work very well. (We can use git blame -C , which works ok but is slow. There‚Äôs no good solution for git log .) We could have easily avoided this by putting the move in its own commit. Two months later There‚Äôs always a risk that the minute you‚Äôve finished a cleanup like this, the weeds start growing again. But we‚Äôve not found that to be the case. The clearer organization makes it more obvious where new code should go, and it‚Äôs easier for teams to focus their code in just one or two directories that match their project. Of course, as the company introduces new products and sunsets old ones, the code structure will need to change to match, but now it‚Äôs obvious how to do that. And it‚Äôs easier for even the most long-tenured engineer to find their way around the codebase. As for our new employees, they don‚Äôt know how good they have it.", "date": "2018-03-19"},

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Profiling App Engine Memcached", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/profiling-app-engine-memcached/", "abstract": "By Ben Kraft Last year, William wrote about how we optimized our in-memory content data to take up less space.  But this was always a temporary solution: if we want to have a separate content tree for each language, we knew we would need to break up the monolithic content blob, and pull in content on-demand. In principle, doing this is simple ‚Äî we already use App Engine‚Äôs Memcached , so all we need to do is change our data structures to pull in content from there whenever someone asks for it.  But that might be some unknown amount slower ‚Äî many requests access dozens or even hundreds of content items, which right now is plenty fast!  We had several ideas for how to improve access patterns and speed things up, but we didn‚Äôt want to spend a couple months building one only to find it wasn‚Äôt fast enough.  We had some vague guesses as to how often we access content, what requests would be the worst, and how fast Memcached is, but we didn‚Äôt really know.  So last fall we set out to find out. Measuring Memcached latency First we just wanted to answer a simple question: how fast is a Memcached access on App Engine?  Despite our heavy use of Memcached, we didn‚Äôt really have a good estimate!  So we wrote a simple API endpoint to profile a Memcached get: ‚Äú`py @app.route(‚Äò‚Ä¶‚Äô) @developer required def profile memcached():     num bytes = int(request.args.get(num bytes))     data = os.urandom(num bytes)     key = ‚Äòprofile memcache_{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}s‚Äô {8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} base64.b64encode(os.urandom(16))     success = memcache.set(key, data)     if not success:         raise RuntimeError(‚ÄòMemcached set failed!‚Äô) get_start = time.time() data_again = memcache.get(key) get_end = time.time()  memcache.delete(key) return flask.jsonify(     time=get_end - get_start,     correct=data == data_again,     key=key) ‚Äú` A thread pool and ten thousand API calls later, we had some data! Memcached latency distribution over 10,000 requests.  On the x-axis, the inverted percentile (so ‚Äú1‚Äù is the 99th percentile), on a log-scale.  On the y-axis, latency in seconds, on a log-scale.  Each line is a different size of value in Memcached, from 1 to 1 million bytes.  So for a 1 million byte value (the uppermost line), the median latency is about 11ms, the 99th percentile is 21ms, and the 99.9th percentile is 43ms. We got a few things out of this data right away.  First of all, latency is in the 1-4ms range for most requests, and nearly always below 10ms.   Second, for all except very large values, the size of the value doesn‚Äôt make a big difference in latency; even for very large values the difference is less than the factor of difference in value sizes. But adding as many as a hundred serial 1-4ms fetches to each request wouldn‚Äôt be an acceptable latency cost.  We did another series of tests and found that the response time for a single multi-get was similar to that of a single get.  So in principle, we could rewrite all our code fetch entities in bulk, but that would be difficult and time-consuming to do across our entire codebase, and we didn‚Äôt know how effective it would be. Simulating Memcached latency Luckily, we had another pile of data at our disposal.  For a small percentage of our requests, we set up logging to record which content items were accessed in the request.  We initial used this to get simple aggregates: data on how many items were accessed in a particular request, for example.  But along with the Memcached profiling data, we could do more: we could simulate how much slower a request would be if it had to make a particular number of Memcached hits. We started by assuming that every content item accessed was a Memcached fetch (the first time in the request).  This was, as expected, too slow: over 10{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} of requests got at least 50{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} slower.  We could hand-optimize a few problematic routes, but not all of them, so we needed a more general strategy.  One natural option was to cache some data in-memory on each instance. Since we had this data, we could simulate particular strategies for caching some content items in memory.  We simulated both an LRU cache and choosing in advance a fixed set of items to cache, with several sizes of each.  The latter strategy did significantly better than the LRU cache.  This remained true even if we used the chronologically first half of the data to decide which items to cache, and measured against the second half, which we took as validation that we could actually choose a fairly accurate set in practice. Simulated increased request latency distribution over all instrumented requests.  On the x-axis, the inverted percentile, on a log-scale, as in the above graph.  On the y-axis, fraction of increased latency, on a log-scale.  Each line is a different caching strategy, with or without the multi-get of children.  For example, at the 90th percentile, without a cache we see a latency increase around 50{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}; a fixed cache reduces that to 10{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}, vs. 12{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} for an LRU cache. However, our results still weren‚Äôt quite as good as we wanted; even excluding a few pages we figured could be manually optimized, we were still adding 25{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} or more to 5{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} of requests.  But we still hadn‚Äôt made use of the multi-gets we profiled.  First we simulated immediately pulling all children of a topic into cache with a single multi-get for the duration of the request whenever we requested the topic, which we knew would be fairly easy to do.  This wasn‚Äôt enough, but after several variations on it, we found a strategy that did: if, whenever we loaded a topic page, we pulled in all descendants of that topic (again with a single multi-get), down to some depth, that helped a lot.  While it would require code changes, we thought they should be simple enough to be manageable, with nowhere near as many unknowns as ‚Äúnow fix up all problematic code paths‚Äù. Doing it for real Since then, we‚Äôve implemented the system for real, which I‚Äôll talk about in our next blog post!  Not everything worked out as planned, of course.  But to build this system out in reality took months, and testing out different caching strategies in production would have days or weeks of turnaround time, whereas in our simulations we could test out a new strategy in just a few minutes.  It required some guessing about our codebase ‚Äî knowing that ‚Äúon topic pages, pull in every descendant of the topic at the start‚Äù was something we could implement, while, say, ‚Äúpull in every item we need to render the page at once‚Äù definitely wasn‚Äôt.  Of course, a lot of things we didn‚Äôt know, but we felt much more confident moving forward with actually implementing a months-long engineering effort with some assurance that the plan has some chance of working.  And now we know, a lot more precisely, just what performance we can expect from App Engine Memcached. Appendix: App Engine Memcached latency data If you also use App Engine‚Äôs dedicated Memcached service, you may find the below data useful.  Note that each sample was taken over the course of an hour or so, so it doesn‚Äôt account for rare events like memcache outages or more generally capture latency over time.  That‚Äôs also a potential source of difference between the two tables; they were measured at different times.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Making Websites Work with Windows High Contrast Mode", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/making-websites-work-with-windows-high-contrast-mode/", "abstract": "By Diedra Rater At Khan Academy, we‚Äôve been working to make our web product more accessible to a variety of users, including those who experience blurry vision and/or severe color-blindness. Part of this work has involved updating our styling to be able to work well with Windows High Contrast Mode. This project required a little bit of learning via trial-and-error, with a lot of help from our dear friends at Level Access , so I wanted to share some of the things we discovered to make it easier for other developers working with accessibility. In this post, you‚Äôll learn about how to optimize web applications for the benefit of other users with visual accessibility needs. What is it and who uses it? Windows High Contrast Mode is an accessibility settings feature in the Windows operating system. As the name suggests, it changes the visual appearance of everything displayed to have higher contrast. This includes applications that are native to the Windows platform as well as web apps. Khan Academy‚Äôs logged out homepage without Windows High Contrast Mode: Khan Academy‚Äôs logged out homepage with Windows High Contrast Mode: The high contrast version of the web may not be as pretty, but it is easier to see and understand. There are several different versions of Windows High Contrast Mode that can be used. The examples in this post use High Contrast White. What does it do? Background colors and images Background colors and background images are removed and replaced with white. Both of these styles would be overridden: css background-color: lawngreen; /* No color for you. */ background-image: url(\"cousin_fal.gif\"); /* No image either. */ (You can see an example of this in #1 of the Comparison section below.) The opacity of background color styles will remain the same, though. The color will just be changed to white. In this code example, the background is set to 50{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} black. In Windows High Contrast Mode, it will instead be 50{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} white. css background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* White as the driven snow if the driven show were 50{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} opacity. */ Key takeaway Only use background-color and background-image CSS for decorative styling. Windows High Contrast Mode considers them unnecessary to understand the page. Border and outline colors For border colors and outline colors, it actually goes the other way. No matter what color or opacity you set, they‚Äôll be set to 100{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} black in Windows High Contrast Mode. css outline: 2px dotted lightsalmon; /* Black as your heart. */ border: 2px solid lavenderblush; /* And my coffee. */ (You can see an example of this in #2 of the Comparison section below.) Key takeaway Borders and outlines should be functional, not ornamental, because Windows High Contrast Mode retains them. Also, they won‚Äôt be distinguishable if used to separate black sections created by and SVG elements. and SVG elements and SVG elements are immune and will remain intact. html ... (You can see an example of this in #3 of the Comparison section below.) Key takeaway Semantic and SVG elements are for important, functional elements. Windows High Contrast Mode assumes they‚Äôre required to interpret the page. Font colors Font colors work the same as border and outline colors but with one more detail ‚Äî the text element‚Äôs background will be set to white. This is because the and SVG elements are unchanged. If you have text on top of an or SVG element, the text could become impossible to see if the image were dark when the text becomes black. By forcing the text to be black and have a white background, Windows High Contrast Mode ensures that the user will be able to read the text regardless of what or SVG you may have behind it. In this example, the text will be black with a white background. css color: lemonchiffon; (You can see an example of this in #4 of the Comparison section below.) Key takeaway You don‚Äôt need to worry about text color; it can handle itself. Comparison Here‚Äôs a section of the screenshots of the Khan Academy logged out homepage. Here we can see examples of almost all the ways Windows High Contrast Mode alters our custom styling: The background color of the dark blue button and the light gray horizontal list of domains below the image are now white. The borders on all three buttons are now black. The image of the sky remains intact because it‚Äôs been added as an SVG element. All the text on the page has returned to its default browser color (black for non-links and blue for links), and the text on top of the SVG image has a white background. Improve web applications in Windows High Contrast Mode ‚Äî practical examples from our work Quick note.. I wanted to mention up-front that there is a -ms-high-contrast CSS media feature that allows you to detect if the page is being viewed in Windows High Contrast Mode. However, it is non-standard and unreliable; therefore, none of the examples shown here utilize this feature. Background colors and images Use HTML s and SVG‚Äôs instead of background-color and background-image CSS for important elements in the design . Windows High Contrast Mode removes these characteristics of the page for a reason, so I don‚Äôt want to encourage you to override that override altogether. But sometimes there are elements on the page that are visually necessary for users to understand the user interface and interact with it accordingly. Replacing CSS background-image with an element Khan Academy video pages enable people to discuss the video, including links to specific points in the video in their comments. We visually communicate that the button jumps to a specific time in the video with a little blue play image to the left of the timestamp. This image was originally added using CSS‚Äôs background-image . Of course, it was being removed in Windows High Contrast Mode and a big empty space was left instead. To fix this, we removed the background-image from the CSS and added the image back with a img element so it would appear in both default and Windows High Contrast Modes. Before Screenshot: CSS: ‚Äú`css .videoPlayButton {     background: url(‚Äò/wp-content/uploads/engblog/play.png‚Äô) no-repeat left;     padding-left: 18px;     background-size: 14px 14px; /* Non-relevant styling has been removed for simplicity. */ } ‚Äú` JSX: ‚Äú jsx // This is the same in both versions. const timestamp = \"3:14\"; // Just for an example, to simplify this code. const timestampAria = ${timestamp} Click to jump to ${timestamp} in video`; return ( {timestamp} ); ‚Äú` After Screenshot: CSS: css .videoPlayButton {     /* Non-relevant styling has been removed for simplicity. */ } .videoPlayIcon {     height: 14px;     width: 14px;     margin-top: -4px;     vertical-align: middle; } JSX: ‚Äú jsx // This is the same in both versions. const timestamp = \"3:14\"; // Just for an example, to simplify this code. const timestampAria = ${timestamp} Click to jump to ${timestamp} in video`; const playIcon = ; return ( {playIcon} {timestamp} ); ‚Äú` Replacing CSS background-color with an SVG element Above the discussions feature on video pages, the video itself has a large play button on top. The actual play icon is an SVG HTML element, but it‚Äôs white, and the color for the area around it was added using background-color CSS. Of course, in Windows High Contrast Mode, the background-color CSS was removed and replaced with white, which left users with a white icon on a white background. Oops! There are a couple of different ways to fix this, but, in this case, we chose to replace the element behind the icon with another SVG, which would retain its color. (Another option would be to allow the color of the SVG element to be overridden, which is illustrated in the next example.) Before Screenshot: CSS: ‚Äú`css .playButton {     background-color: #1865f2;     width: 121px;     height: 121px; /* Non-relevant styling has been removed for simplicity. */ } ‚Äú` JSX: ‚Äú jsx // This is the same in both examples. const playIcon = M1.6,9.9C1.5,10,1.3,10,1.2,10C1.1,10,1,10,0.9,9.9C0.7,9.8,0.6,9.6,     0.6,9.4V0.6c0-0.2,0.2-0.4,0.4-0.5C1.1,0,1.4,0,1.6,0.1l7.6,4.5c0.2,0.1,     0.3,0.3,0.3,0.5c0,0.2-0.1,0.4-0.3,0.5L1.6,9.9z`; const PLAY BUTTON DIAMETER = 44; ‚Äú` After Screenshot: CSS: css .playButton {     /* Non-relevant styling has been removed for simplicity. */ } JSX: ‚Äú jsx // This is the same in both examples. const playIcon = M1.6,9.9C1.5,10,1.3,10,1.2,10C1.1,10,1,10,0.9,9.9C0.7,9.8,0.6,9.6,     0.6,9.4V0.6c0-0.2,0.2-0.4,0.4-0.5C1.1,0,1.4,0,1.6,0.1l7.6,4.5c0.2,0.1,     0.3,0.3,0.3,0.5c0,0.2-0.1,0.4-0.3,0.5L1.6,9.9z`; const PLAY BUTTON DIAMETER = 121; const PLAY BUTTON RADIUS = Math.floor(PLAY BUTTON DIAMETER / 2); ‚Äú` Add CSS background-color via a pseudo-element You can also force the background-color CSS to remain by adding it to a pseudo-element. This isn‚Äôt a tactic that we happened to use, but it is available if necessary. CSS: css .element:after {   content:\"\";   background-color: someothercsscolornameyoudidntknowexisted; } Allowing the SVG color to be overridden using fillColor The colors of SVG‚Äôs will remain intact in Windows High Contrast Mode, but only if the colors are set directly on fill . If the svg image is white in your design, you should avoid setting that white color using fill: yourColor . Instead set fill to currentColor and set the color on a wrapper element. Then, in Windows High Contrast Mode, the color will be set to black and the svg will adjust accordingly. Here‚Äôs an example of one place where we fixed this ‚Äî the logo in the global header on Khan Academy. Before Screenshot: CSS: css .logoSvg {     fill: #fff; } JSX: jsx return ( ... ); After Screenshot: CSS: css .logoLink {     fill: #fff; } .logoSvg {     fill: currentColor; } JSX: jsx return ( ... ); Border and outline colors Use invisible borders and outlines to visually define edges of elements that are created through different background colors laid against each other. Since borders and outlines are automatically set to 100{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} opacity black, you can make them 0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} opacity in default mode so they will only appear in Windows High Contrast Mode. Borders can have rounded edges and be restricted to specific sides, but they increase the size of the element. To avoid affecting the design in default mode, if you‚Äôre retrofitting an existing design, you might want to use an outline . This is something we encountered with our sign up/login modals, which are visually defined based on their light background colors against the dark partially-transparent backdrop. (Side-note: Here you can see an example of a partially-transparent background color being set to white but with the same opacity as in the original CSS.) Before Screenshot: After Screenshot: CSS: css .modal {     border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0); } Summary In the end, the best approach to accessibility that I‚Äôve found is to follow the web development standards when possible. Use semantic HTML for elements and CSS for styling. If an image is decorative, use background-image CSS. If an image is imperative for all users to see, use an or SVG element (with appropriate alt text). If the element links to something, use an element. Following these standardized patterns will get you most of the way for Windows High Contrast Mode (as well as screen readers and keyboard navigation too). Be careful when overriding default styling. When you override the default styling for an element (for example the focus outline, text decoration, or border on interactive elements), it has an effect that may be invisible to you based on your specific testing environment. Consider making the style invisible using 0{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} opacity color instead of removing it altogether. Questions / comments / sweet memes?

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "New data pipeline management platform at Khan Academy", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/new-data-pipeline-management-platform-at-khan-academy/", "abstract": "By Ragini Gupta Data is very crucial to Khan Academy and is itself an internal product for the company. Analysts, engineers and marketing are some of the daily consumers of data. We have various systems for managing pipelines which are self-contained processes for doing analysis on some data. They consume some input and produce some output. There are more than two hundred data pipelines in the company currently and the number is constantly growing. We at Khan Academy realized the importance of having an efficient way of managing our increasing number of pipelines and the result was‚Ä¶ Khanalytics. Life before Khanalytics There was no single place where one could find all pipelines: Some were very well tied to our website and resided in our cloud infrastructure along with the rest of our application. Some pipelines were more manual and generated data by manual querying. Some were using R scripts and were run manually on local machines. Some were hosted on a separate machine and run using a cron service. We had complex pipelines with different stages that couldn‚Äôt talk to each other : Some pipelines were complex enough to have their different stages written in different languages or use different tools. There was no way we could use R, Python, Google BigQuery, Google Cloud Dataflow etc. in the very same pipeline and pass data between those stages. The pipeline iteration process was slow : Since most pipelines lived with the code of rest of the website, changing an existing pipeline or creating a new one required many of the same steps as building user-facing functionality. Scheduling a single pipeline also involved multiple steps every time. Debugging pipeline failures was hard as the logs were either not easy to find or not informative enough. It‚Äôs too easy to introduce bugs : Since most pipelines existed with the website codebase, a bug in the pipelines‚Äô code could introduce errors on the complete website. Khanalytics: a platform for data pipeline lifecycle management It‚Äôs easier to describe Khanalytics by talking of its features: Completely sandboxed environment for running batch jobs. A web user interface that‚Äôs user friendly and aimed to be used by non-developers as well. Ability to parallelize different steps in a pipeline automatically. Single place to find all logs for debugging. Ability to schedule pipelines individually and also with dependency on other pipelines. Architecture Khanalytics is built on some core fundamentals mentioned below. Everything is a container : All steps in Khanalytics (called stages) including the core components of the application are completely isolated from each other since they run in containers. We use Kubernetes in Google Kubernetes Engine to create a cluster and manage deployment of our containers. We pre-build images for all containers (Python, BigQuery, R, etc.) and start a container with the relevant image. Since everything is in a container, it‚Äôs easy enough to customize or extend the types of pipelines we‚Äôd want to support. Statelessness : All state is managed by etcd , which is a state store. The individual services communicate with etcd about the state of individual pipelines, to start any new pipelines or to update the current state of a running pipeline. This improves reliability of the application as there are fewer communication paths. Static configuration : We store the configuration of a pipeline in a JSON format which is static. The configuration consists of the environment, individual stages, inputs, outputs and intermediates. We allow variable interpolation in the environment variables so that certain things like current date that are dynamic, are filled in at runtime. The static configuration allows us to lint it as soon as it‚Äôs created ensuring that the configuration is always valid. It also allows us to know about the pipeline in advance and how parallel its different stages are. Scheduling : Khanalytics uses the Kubernetes scheduler to schedule jobs and run them at a specified time, once or repeatedly. This is done with Kubernetes‚Äô inherent cron feature called CronJob . Permissions : Khanalytics uses Google‚Äôs Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) . Once a user accessing Khanalytics is authorized, they log into the application using a service account which in turn has pre-declared access to different external services which can be accessed from Khanalytics. User-interface While we can access and manage pipelines using a command-line tool, a user friendly UI allows for non-developer users to create, manage and view their pipelines. Impact Khanalytics started as a hackathon project at Khan Academy and resulted in being our single, go-to place for managing analytics pipelines. Apart from solving the problems it was created for, we find it creating bigger impacts. It provides more empowerment to the non-developers which encourages them to create data pipelines for things that weren‚Äôt priorities for the engineering team. We saw an increase in its usage and a reduction in debugging and monitoring time. It has also promoted reusability of data or pipeline stages as a result of more visibility and easier interpretability. What next? We are improving the platform significantly in its reliability, usability as well as its ability to meet all needs of Khan Academy. We have a lot of work ahead of us in migrating all our analytics pipelines to Khanalytics and this migration process is also an input into testing and improving Khanalytics even more. We don‚Äôt think that we are far away from Khanalytics being the single solution to data pipelining at Khan Academy or even beyond, as we consider the possibility of open sourcing Khanalytics for others to use. Many thanks to Colin Fuller, Kevin Dangoor and Tom Yedwab for their review of this post and a big shout-out to all who‚Äôve worked and provided feedback on Khanalytics to help make what it is today.", "date": "2018-04-30"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Building a Really, Really Small Android App", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/building-a-really-really-small-android-app/", "abstract": "By Charlie Marsh App size is important to us. As a team striving to deliver a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere, it‚Äôs essential that we build an app our learners can download and keep around on-disk, no matter the quality of their data plan or device. (App size is of particular interest to us on Android given the potential for Instant Apps .) For our most recent Healthy Hackathon , I set off to build the smallest useful Khan Academy Android app. I set these constraints for myself: The app must be able to play any video in our content library (i.e., I excluded support for other content types, like practice exercises). The app must be polished enough to plausibly ship (i.e., it should use our color palette, include some KA branding, and so forth). The app should be backwards compatible to at least Android API 16, Jelly Bean (the earliest version that our existing app supports). The download payload must be under 1 MB [1]. As it turned out, this last constraint was far too conservative‚Äîthe final APK clocked in at a download size of 26 kilobytes . But before we review the numbers, let‚Äôs take a look at the app itself. A Minimally Viable Video Player The basic flow of the app is straightforward: on each screen, you‚Äôre presented with a list of topics. Tapping on a topic takes you one level deeper in the hierarchy, until you reach a playable video. Navigating to a video (15 FPS recording). The app is compatible back to API version 10 (Gingerbread). It also works offline, to a degree: you can navigate to a screen you‚Äôve visited before without connectivity, even across restarts. This whole experience clocks in at just 26 kilobytes (20 kilobytes for pre-Lollipop devices) to download, with the APK expanding to 40 kilobytes on-disk for an L-device‚Äîfar, far below my 1 MB goal, and more than 1000 times smaller than our existing app . ( Here‚Äôs a link to the Hackathon-quality source!) Breaking Down the APK If our existing app is 1000 times larger than this minimally viable video player, where are we spending those extra megabytes? And what is this tiny app doing differently? To answer these questions, I whipped out Android Studio‚Äôs new APK Analyzer . A breakdown of the minimal video player app‚Äôs APK. The estimated raw file size was a slight underestimation compared to what I measured on-disk. In comparing this APK to that of our existing app, I bucketed app size contributions into three categories: assets (images, fonts, etc.), content, and code. For reference, our existing Android app measures 31 MB to download and 40+ MB on-disk. (We‚Äôre working hard to bring these numbers down!) The download size is roughly split between assets, content, and code as 17 MB, 10 MB, and 4 MB respectively. For the minimal app, the classes.dex file comprises the majority of the contribution from code, though much of the layout-* subdirectories could also be considered ‚Äôcode‚Äô; the drawable-*/ and mipmap-* directories contain our assets; and content is nowhere to be seen. Let‚Äôs review each pillar in-turn. Assets In our existing Android app, assets (and images, in particular, which power much of our UI) make up nearly half of our download size. Worse still, since these assets (JPGs and PNGs) are already compressed, their contributions to our app‚Äôs download and on-disk sizes are roughly 1:1. Fonts are a challenge as well, since we not only package fonts for cosmetic purposes, but also to support math rendering. The minimalist approach to assets: Don‚Äôt use any! (Or, at least, only include essential assets, and only when necessary.) I intentionally opted for a minimal, text-based UI, which makes theming cheap and easy, since you can rely on a color palette and avoid packaging any images. Rather than using the wonderful fonts that power our existing app, I opted to mimic the system font instead (and didn‚Äôt tackle math rendering in any way, given that I stuck to video content). For the few assets that I did include, I took care to minimize their footprint in a few ways. For example, with our logo (as seen in the app bar), my goal was to package just a single version of the asset, and only for devices that would actually use it. So, to keep the contribution down, I first ran the asset through an SVG minifier and then packaged it as a single VectorDrawable , which saved me the need to include a larger-resolution image for each density bucket, much less the font we use to render it (which would‚Äôve contributed tens of KBs by itself). I also built out a separate APK for pre-Lollipop devices to exclude the VectorDrawable asset and any other extraneous layout resources (like the custom toolbar layout). Content Library In our existing Android app, content (or, more accurately, our content library‚Äôs metadata) makes up about 30% of our download size, though that contribution nearly triples on-disk, since these files compress quite well. Our content library consists of tens of thousands of videos, articles, and exercises. In building out our Android app, it was important to us that learners have a snappy experience on first-run, and that they could use the app to browse through our library even while offline. For simplicity, we started off by shipping the metadata describing the structure of our content library with the APK itself, which allow for immediate navigation through the content hierarchy, regardless of connectivity status. (Unfortunately, this requires that we package a separate metadata database for each language that we support. (We‚Äôre working on it!)) The minimalist approach to content: Only download the minimal metadata that you need for a given screen, as the user approaches it. To make for a snappier experience, pre-fetch content as the user moves down the topic tree, and cache liberally. This app in particular fetches the metadata needed to render the first N child topics upon opening a new topic screen. Since each topic maps to a single HTTP request, the app can rely on a very simple URL cache to implement persistence and support offline navigation. I also slimmed down the sheer amount of data necessary to power the UI, removing the need for certain information (like the download size for a given video or the URL at which it can be downloaded) needed in our existing Android UI. Given this minimal design, the entire topic tree could be cached on disk over time. Code In our existing Android app, code makes up a small portion of the total download size‚Äîless than 10% [2]. It is the least significant of these three pillars. In the context of a 26 KB app, though, code size becomes critical. (It‚Äôs also the most interesting to optimize.) I combined a couple different approaches to minimize code size. First: the app has zero dependencies . No Retrofit, no support library, no Guava‚Äîno nothing. Instead, the codebase relies on the Android framework as much as possible, taking advantage of all the functionality that ships with Android devices. This decision impacted both the UI/UX layer and the level of abstraction at which I could operate as the engineer. For example, the app: Uses the system video player ( VideoView and MediaController ), rather than the nicer, more customizable, and more feature-complete ExoPlayer . Implements asynchronous operations with AsyncTask , rather than e.g., RxJava (which we use heavily in our existing app). Performs all networking with HttpURLConnection and org.json , rather than relying on nicer libraries like OkHttp , Retrofit , and the like. ‚ÄôZero dependencies‚Äô also implies no Android support libraries, which has its own implications (e.g., no Fragments (if you want to support pre-Honeycomb devices), a non-uniform action bar across API versions). (As an aside: I‚Äôd recommend that every Android engineer take a crack at building a zero-dependency app. It‚Äôs a great learning experience.) Beyond the ‚Äôno dependencies‚Äô rule, I made a few other optimizations at the end, when the APK was getting really tiny, though I tried to avoid sacrificing readability or robustness. These included: Running the output APK through Facebook‚Äôs bytecode optimizer , Redex . This brought the download size down from 30.7 KB to 26.2 KB. Removing any strings that were used merely for logging or to decorate error messages (the justification being that these could, in theory, be reconstructed server-side). This cut another 1.4 KB. Converting from enums to static integers . I mostly did this as a joke and haven‚Äôt actually analyzed the Dex dump to see how it impacted the resulting bytecode, though the download size did come down by another 1.2 KB. All of this was on top of Jack‚Äôs minification. Of course, another way that I reduced code size was simply by doing less . Our existing app has interactive articles and exercises, adaptive streaming, offline playback, search, bookmarking, and more. And we pay for that functionality by writing and shipping more code. (In my own (early) experiments to parse our Dexfile and analyze code size contributions by package, I‚Äôve found that our own code makes up about 27% of all instructions.) To be able to ship a viable video player app with just an 11 KB Dexfile is pretty astounding, given that we‚Äôve identified individual Swift files that contribute over a kilobyte per line to our IPA. Going Forward Though our existing Android app is far larger than 26 KB, the good news is that many of the approaches that I took here were inspired by changes that we‚Äôre already planning to make to that codebase. For example, ‚Äôfetch the minimal content necessary to power a screen‚Äô is something that we‚Äôre actively exploring, as is ‚Äôonly package the assets that are absolutely necessary [for a given device]‚Äô (through a combination of APK splitting and other optimizations). Though we may not reduce our app size to mere kilobytes, with any luck, we‚Äôll be able to cut it down substantially using similar techniques to those explored in this post. Interested in making slim Android apps to bring education to millions of learners globally? Come join us ! [1] All download sizes were taken from Android Studio 2.2‚Äôs new APK Analyzer , which is still in ‚ÄôPreview‚Äô. On-disk sizes were taken from the ‚ÄôTotal Storage‚Äô reading of the ‚ÄôApp Info‚Äô screen, on-device. [2] This excludes the APK contributions that come from the JavaScript bundles that we ship with the app, which power our interactive article and exercise experiences. Those contribute to our app size in a substantial way, but the optimization story there differs significantly, and so I chose not to explore that avenue in this project.", "date": "2016-08-22"},

Khan Academy is translated into Spanish and Turkish and Polish and more ‚Äì and this includes not only text, but also the articles, exercises, and videos. Thanks to the efforts of translators, learners around the world can use Khan Academy to learn in their language. Internationalization is important. Internationalization is also an engineering challenge: it requires infrastructure to mark which strings in a codebase need to exist in multiple different languages, to store and look up the translated versions of those strings, and to show the user a different website accordingly. Additionally, since our translations are crowdsourced, we need infrastructure to allow translators to translate strings, to show translators where their effort is most needed, and to show these translations once they‚Äôre ready. There are many moving parts. When I arrived at Khan Academy at the beginning of this summer, some of these moving parts in our internationalization infrastructure were responsible for most of the time our deploys took to finish. One of the things I accomplished this summer during my internship here was to banish this slowness from our deploy times. The problem Whenever we download the latest translation data from Crowdin , which hosts our crowdsourced translations, we rebuild the translation files ‚Äì files which the Khan Academy webapp can read in order to show translated webpages. The next time an engineer deploys a new version of the webapp, these new translation files are then deployed as well. Uploading files to Google App Engine, which hosts the Khan Academy website, is usually the slowest part of our deploys; the translation files are big, so translation files in particular are a major contributor to this. So, whenever the latest translations are downloaded and rebuilt, the next deploy would be quite a bit slower while it uploaded the changed files. Furthermore, since it‚Äôs not always the case that translation files have been rebuilt recently, as an engineer it‚Äôs hard to tell whether the deploy you‚Äôre about to make will be hit with Translations Upload Duty or not. Sometimes deploys would take around 30 minutes, sometimes they would take around 75 minutes or more: The previous state of affairs ‚Äì 30-minute deploys punctuated by 75-minute deploys. There are a couple of lulls in this graph where deploys are consistently near 30 minutes: these reflect times when our download from Crowdin was not working. The fix We decided to rearrange the infrastructure around this so that instead of uploading translation files to Google App Engine (GAE) along with the rest of the webapp, we would upload the translation files to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) in a separate process and then modify the webapp to read the files from there. Implementing this required making a few different changes, and the changes had to be coordinated in such a way as to keep internationalized sites up and running throughout the entire process: Upload the translation files to GCS whenever they‚Äôre updated. Change the webapp to read translations from GCS instead of from GAE. Stop uploading the now-unnecessary translation files to GAE. These steps by themselves are enough to implement the change to make deploys faster, but we also want to make sure that this project won‚Äôt break anything ‚Äì so instead, the steps look something like: Upload the translation files to GCS whenever they‚Äôre updated. Measure everything. (How much will this cost? How fast will the upload be?) Change the webapp to read translations from GCS instead of from GAE. Measure everything. (How much slower is this than reading from disk? Will requests be slower?) Stop uploading the now-unnecessary translation files to GAE. Measure everything. (Do translated sites still work?) One thing I experimented with while working on this project was keeping a lab notebook of sorts in a Google Doc; this was where I went to record everything I learned, from little commands that might be useful later, to dependencies I had to install, to all of the measurements I ended up making. This was a good decision. This habit and these notes did in fact turn out to be useful, frequently. The consequences Deploys are faster! I deployed the last piece of this project on August 20, 2015. Deploy times have been more consistent since: the graph of deploy times is free of the spikes that previously indicated translation uploads. Before and after; the change happened on 8/20. Translations can be updated independently! Now we don‚Äôt require an engineer to deploy new code in order to change the translations that appear on Khan Academy ‚Äì¬†translations are updated by a separate job. Also, this opens up new possibilities ‚Äì we can now do exciting things like updating our languages independently of each other, and make it so that the time between when a translator makes a translation and when that translation shows up on the main site becomes even shorter. Our internationalization efforts will be able to push forward even faster!", "date": "2015-10-12"},

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Stories from our latest intern class", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/stories-from-our-latest-intern-class/", "abstract": "By 2015 Interns We sent an email out to all of the 2015 interns in early November, shortly after they had left KA. The email said that we were hoping to write a blog post on our intern class, and asked them ‚Äúdo you have a most memorable moment, a project you liked, a lesson learned, or really anything you‚Äôd like to share with the world in this way?‚Äù Here are four responses‚Ä¶ Chelsea Voss: Mobile! I had a blast interning at Khan Academy last summer! I learned a lot during those few months. Beyond the different projects I got to work on, one additional chance to learn something new was at the Khan Academy Healthy Hackathon ‚Äî I‚Äôd like to share how this hackathon became my introduction to mobile app programming. One of the things that I find seriously awesome about Khan Academy‚Äôs computer programming curriculum is getting to see the awesome JavaScript projects that learners come up with when given the chance to create. If you take a look at that page, you‚Äôll find puzzle games, 2D art, interactive stories, and more ‚Äî it‚Äôs great to see all of these ideas made programs, and to see so many people having fun learning to code. For our hackathon project, fellow interns Neel Mehta, Sherman Leung, and I built an app that would browse and play these JavaScript projects from a phone. First, we prototyped, brainstorming several different designs for what such an app might look like, thinking about different layouts and ways the look of the UI could go‚Ä¶ Figure 1: Late-night prototyping ‚Ä¶then it was build, build, build! I had never built a mobile app before, so it was pretty exciting to work on something like this from scratch. Neel had worked with Ionic before, and got me up to speed with the framework ‚Äî learning was faster with tutelage! Figure 2: It lives! The resulting app is actually pretty fun to use, since the JavaScript projects themselves are so fun. The app isn‚Äôt released, but the code for this project is up at GitHub. I‚Äôm proud of what we made, and I‚Äôm happy that I got this opportunity to learn about something new! Alexander Irpan: Mail Time I had a really good time at Khan Academy. The work was interesting, and it felt awesome to directly contribute to such a great site. I could go on and on about the fun things we did outside of work, but I wanted to share the craziest developer experience I had this summer. My first intern project was to backup Khan Academy‚Äôs mailing list data. Khan Academy uses SailThru to manage most of its emails. (It turns out KA has a lot more mailing lists than you would think.) At the time, most lists were only stored on SailThru‚Äôs servers, so my project was to build a cron job that would save those mailing lists to our local Google Cloud Storage. After building the whole backup system, I manually triggered a backup to test it out. The next day, I checked the logs, and found out it failed because requests to Sailthru‚Äôs API were sent through our internal developer client, which mocks all calls to third party services. The only way that could happen was if is_production() returned False in production. Wait, what? Figure 1: Wat I dug through the other code that used the client, and found an existing cron job with the same problem. Taking a tip from a dev presentation on debugging, I binary searched on dates and found out that job stopped working 9 months ago. Figure 2: WAT Okay, wow, that was really bad, especially because no one knew about it until now. With the date, I could take advantage of source control and browse all commits that landed into production that day. Eventually, I tracked the bug down to a config error. Khan Academy runs on Google App Engine, which supports splitting apps into modules. The cron jobs ran on the modules for backend processing, and one of the checks for is production() was not set in that module‚Äôs config file. After fixing that, both the old cron job and the one I added started working again. Luckily, the damage from the bug was minor, since the vast majority of code using SailThru ran on modules where is production() correctly returned True. Any lingering issues got fixed by the next job run. All in all, it was some of the best detective work I have ever done for debugging. Phillip Lemons: KLS My most memorable experience at Khan Academy was the annual hackathon where I got to spend the better part of the week working on a sign in system for the Khan Lab School (KLS). At KLS the students have a certain amount of flexibility on when they can arrive at school in the morning. While this flexibility is great for the parents and the students, it makes keeping track of attendance a big hassle for the teachers. I teamed up with Vishesh, another intern, to solve this problem by building an RFID sign in system that would be hooked up to a web app that parents could use to sign in their kids. The hope was that parents would be able to use RFID cards that they had already been given to get inside the building to also sign in their kids. The first thing Vishesh and I did was get to work on designing the web app. We figured that we would need a main page that would allow parents to sign their kids in, an admin page for teachers to manage who was allowed to sign in which students, and a page that gave a list of kids who were currently signed in. I spent the next few days learning the ins and outs of AngularJS while I created the admin page. Even though what I completed didn‚Äôt amount to much, by the end I had a better insight into what it took to create a web app from scratch. Unfortunately, I was unable to go to work over the weekend so I didn‚Äôt get to see the final product. Nonetheless I was still glad I got to work on the project. I think events like this really show that Khan Academy really practices what they preach. Khan Academy follows the idea that ‚Äúanyone can fix anything‚Äù and they really want their employees to always be improving themselves even if it means taking a few days off normal work to experiment and try new things. Vishesh Gupta: Saying Goodbye to an Old Tree One of the things that makes KA so great is the fact that everyone really cares. About the mission, about the learners, and also about each other! All that spontaneous love in the workplace makes it impossible not to get swept up, and us interns were no exception! In the middle of my internship, all of us received the very sad news that intern mama Marcia was leaving us üôÅ Marcia was such an inspiration not only because of her mad technical skills, but also her positive and caring personality. On Marcia‚Äôs last day, us interns banded together to do some spontaneous acts of kindness. It all started when Shannon came to me in the morning and said ‚ÄùLet‚Äôs take Marcia out to tea/dinner and give her a card!‚Äù I made the mistake of pinging the intern room @all and saying ‚ÄùWe‚Äôre writing Marcia a card!‚Äù Of course, Marcia hangs out in the intern room on HipChat and she immediately waved to all of us. So that plan was a bust, and everyone was bummed/mad at me. However, where there is adversity, KA interns rise to the challenge! We decided that we‚Äôd give her a card, and then some. We pretended that no card was going to happen since I‚Äôd ruined it, and got to work. First, Shannon got us all started with some amazing artwork making a badge for Marcia of a mama duck and little ducklings. Will made this available digitally online! Then Alex suggested we get some balloons and even offered to get them himself, and Neel decided to add his inspiration of a KA flag flown at half mast. We all wrote her a card, and completely filled her desk with post-it notes of appreciation. Then we promptly got out of the way so Marcia could enjoy the spectacle. After she came out of her 5 o‚Äôclock meeting, she saw her desk full of appreciative goodies, and was completely taken aback! You can see the results for yourself! What was so beautiful about this experience was watching all of us support each other in this expression of generosity and kindness ‚Äì the minute one of us started the ball rolling, we all jumped on and just spontaneously added on ideas to make this such a heartfelt farewell. It‚Äôs this kind of fun that makes working at KA a blast!", "date": "2015-12-21"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Untangling our Python Code", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/untangling-our-python-code/", "abstract": "By Carter Bastian The previous posts about The Great Khan Academy Python Refactor of 2017 and Also 2018 answered two questions: why and how did we refactor all of our Python code? In this post, I want to look closer at a major goal of this project: cleaning up dependencies between parts of our Python codebase. Going into the project, we decided that we would build a dependency order into the structure of our Python code. Below, we‚Äôll look at why dependency order matters, what our solution looked like, and how we went about implementing it. Why is dependency order important? Take a look at a visual representation of Khan Academy‚Äôs code base: Each dot in this image represents a module in our Python codebase. Each line represents an import of one module by another. tl;dr our Python code was a tangle! Our dependency tangle looped back on itself in complicated and frustrating ways that posed a series of problems: Code didn‚Äôt live where it ‚Äúshould‚Äù, making it hard both for new developers to get oriented in the codebase and for experienced developers to find the particular functionality they‚Äôre looking for. Given an arbitrary change, we didn‚Äôt know what to test because we weren‚Äôt sure what code might indirectly use the code we changed. Intertwined dependencies made it difficult to draw boundaries between logically distinct parts of the codebase. This in turn made it harder to put stronger service-boundaries on our codebase. In short, we had a lot of problems stemming from poor code organization. In addition to these retroactive changes, our less-tangled codebase gives guidance to developers writing new code. Once we put in the work of defining what should and should not be depended on, we know to question any feature design that imports code from higher in the hierarchy. Since this dependency order is built directly into our code structure, we can automatically detect places in the codebase that are either poorly designed or poorly organized. What does dependency order even mean? In general, a dependency order is a set of rules deciding which files can be imported by a piece of code in a codebase. Some languages and frameworks implement dependency order by placing restrictions on possibly-problematic dependency practices. Since Python doesn‚Äôt provide any such rules, we decided to write some of our own. We decided to create these rules by placing each Python file in our codebase into some conceptual bucket, which we call a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù, and then defining an ordering on these buckets. The ordering rule is that a file in bucket X can import a file in bucket Y if and only if Y is lower than X in the ordering. In other words, we divided all of our code into packages and placed these packages in a (mostly) linear order, where any given package is allowed to depend on packages lower than itself. How we decided on the dependency ordering It was not easy to decide how to order the packages. In theory any directed acyclic graph would be a legal ordering. But we decided to limit ourselves to a linear ordering, with one exception: we sometimes had several packages at the same ‚Äúlevel‚Äù. These packages could not depend on one another, but any package above them could depend on any (or all!) of them. We did this both to limit the universe of possible orderings, and to make it easier for humans to understand the final result. A linear ordering is easy to understand and explain to others. However, this did open up an issue that we sometimes had to order two totally unrelated packages, and arbitrarily decide which one was higher and which was lower. Sometimes we would decide by calculating the number of bad dependencies both ways, and seeing which led to fewer bad dependencies! How we untangled our codebase In order to define and enforce our new dependency ordering, we decided to have our 40 packages be top level directories. Any time a file in a lower-level package depends on a file in a higher-level package, we can classify that as a ‚Äúbad dependency‚Äù. By defining what can (and more importantly, what can‚Äôt) be depended on by any given code feature, we can automatically detect places in our codebase that are architecturally problematic. Once we had a set of packages and their ordering figured out, the first step towards implementation was to move each file in our codebase into the appropriate package, as described in the earlier blog posts. This allowed us to reason about our codebase‚Äôs dependency structure. For example, consider the following excerpt from our package list and their descriptions: lib/ ‚Äì Miscellaneous libraries. Utilities with some Khan-specific logic that are still general enough to be used across many components. flags/ ‚Äì Infrastructure implementing A/B testing and feature flagging. coaches/ ‚Äì Contains core models and mechanics for coach/student (including parent/child and teacher/pupil). Also includes code related to classrooms and schools. These three packages above are listed in dependency order. In other words, it‚Äôs fine for the code in flags/ to depend on the more-general code in lib/ . Similarly, the higher-level code in coaches/ implements the coach-student relationship, and should be able to use the lower-level infrastructure in flags/ to set up coach/student-related experiments. Conversely, if a file in the flags/ directory were to import a file from the coaches/ directory, that would violate our dependency order and we would classify that as a ‚Äúbad dependency‚Äù. Conceptually, this feels right; for example, it doesn‚Äôt seem like good design for the infrastructure implementing experiments to depend on specific, product-level experiments. The second step in our process was to find the places where our code wasn‚Äôt following the new dependency rules. We used a script for this which output an HTML report on our dependencies. Specifically, this was big list of all the dependencies in our codebase broken down by package. For example, here‚Äôs an excerpt from one of our package reports listing the bad dependencies (in red) and good dependencies (in green) for one file in the flags/ packages: Flags: flags/experiments.py: depends on coaches/parents.py, coaches/students.py, coaches/teachers.py, sat/util.py, translations/videos.py, flags/bigbingo/bigbingo.py, flags/bingo_identity.py, flags/feature_flags/core.py, flags/gandalf/bridge.py, intl/request.py, web/request/ip_util.py, web/request/url_util.py ‚Ä¶ Diagnostic Report Of 6787 total dependencies, there are 862 bad dependencies (12.700751{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}). As you can see, the example given above was an actual issue in our codebase; the experiment infrastructure was depending on the product logic underlying specific experiments in the coaches/ package. The third and final step was to fix hubs of bad dependencies. This process changed on a case-by-case basis ‚Äî the cause underlying bad dependencies could be anything from poorly designed code to poorly defined packages. More often than not, a file with lots of bad dependencies was indicative of bad code organization ‚Äî either the file was in the wrong place, or the file was doing too many things. In these cases, we were able to use that code smell to refactor files relatively easily and improve our code organization. For example, consider the following excerpt from flags/experiments.py , which has both a function used for logging opt-in experiments, and also a function used to determine if a user is in a classroom so that we can consider showing them coach-related experiments: ‚Äú`python from future import absolute_import import coaches.students  # BAD DEPENDENCY import coaches.teachers  # BAD DEPENDENCY def log opt in experiment event(user id, experiment name,                                 event):     # ‚Ä¶ add analytics for an event def is classroom user(user data):     ‚Äú‚Äù‚ÄùDetermine if user is shown classroom A/B tests‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù     if coaches.teachers.classified as teacher(user data):         return CLASSROOM_USER if (user_data.classroom_user_status !=          UNKNOWN_CLASSROOM_STATUS):     return user_data.classroom_user_status  coaches.students.defer_classroom_status_update(     user_data, caller='is_classroom_user')  return user_data.NOT_CLASSROOM_USER ‚Äú` In this experiment, the bad dependencies are coming from the second function, and they indicate a valid organizational problem: is_classroom_user boils down to an implementation detail for coaching-specific experiments. Since, implementation of specific experiments is outside the scope of experiment infrastructure, flags/experiments.py is trying to do something outside the scope of its package. Thankfully, this is a pretty easy fix: we can just use slicker to move the offending function to wherever the coach-related experiments actually live (in this case, coaches/experiments.py ). After moving this function, flags/experiments.py won‚Äôt depend on coaches.teachers or coaches.students , and our updated package report will look like this: Flags: flags/experiments.py: depends on coaches/parents.py, sat/util.py, translations/videos.py, flags/bigbingo/bigbingo.py, flags/bingo_identity.py, flags/feature_flags/core.py, flags/gandalf/bridge.py, intl/request.py, web/request/ip_util.py, web/request/url_util.py ‚Ä¶ Diagnostic Report Of 6787 total dependencies, there are 860 bad dependencies (12.67128{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}). And just like that, our codebase is two bad dependencies cleaner. Of course, the fixes are rarely so small or straight-forward. We‚Äôd often find tangles of poor code structure that would decrease bad dependencies by quite a bit. The process was roughly the same though and can continue ad infinitum; given more time to work on the project, we‚Äôd simply iterate on steps two and three (looking for bad dependencies and then breaking them up) making the codebase incrementally cleaner. The results On one hand, we weren‚Äôt able to get rid of all of our bad dependencies ‚Äì we still have a whitelist of about 750 imports that violate our new rules. On the other hand, getting to a codebase that exactly matches our self-imposed dependency structure doesn‚Äôt prevent us from getting much of the benefit that such an architecture provides. Even with the many exceptions to our new dependency restrictions, it is much easier to reason about where functionality lives and how to test a given piece of code. To start, one big win is that we were able to record a measurable improvement in our codebase‚Äôs structure! Having 1) built out a formalized notion of what a bad dependency is and 2) written tools for finding them in our codebase, we‚Äôve been able to measure the ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù of our dependency structure over the course of the project. When we first took this measurement, we found that about 15.2{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} of all of our inter-package dependencies were bad. Taking this measurement the codebase in production right after the end of the project, we had reduced the percent of bad dependencies to 7.8{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}. 7.8{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} may still seem like a lot, but you can visually see the difference. Below is the dependency graph generated after our changes. Compared to the first tangle, we see that a lot of the dependencies that had been scattered all over the place have now been concentrated into a few clusters around our inter-package APIs, making the tangle appear‚Ä¶ lighter. What‚Äôs more, the benefits of this continue to help us develop clean code quickly. We now have a check that‚Äôs run at commit time that will let you know if your changes added a new bad import. In other words, you can‚Äôt accidentally introduce dependencies on higher-level code; if you‚Äôre going to violate the new rules, you have to do so explicitly. These effects, in tandem with the clean-ups and refactors that came along with our dependency-chasing process above, left our codebase in a good place. Our self-imposed dependency order will help us develop faster and better in 2018 and beyond.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "The User Write Lock: an Alternative to Transactions for Google App Engine", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/the-user-write-lock-an-alternative-to-transactions-for-google-app-engine/", "abstract": "By Craig Silverstein Transactions are the standard method in Google App Engine‚Äôs datastore ‚Äî as in many databases ‚Äî to ensure atomicity. This is true for both atomic writes of multiple entities, and atomic writes of a single entity: ‚Äú` {.python} @ndb.transactional def safe watched video(user id, video):      user = GetUser(user id)      user.num videos watched += 1      user.put()      video log = GetUserVideoLog(user)      video log.add watched video(video)      video_log.put() @ndb.transactional def safe login counter(user id):      user = GetUser(user id)      user.num_logins += 1      user.put() ‚Äú` Transactions work by checking all the entities that you plan on put() -ing at both the beginning and end of the function. If someone else had changed an entity in the datastore while the function was running, the transaction rolls back the function and retries. When people think of transactions, they often think of atomically updating multiple entities; a transaction ensures that either both the video-log and the user are updated, or neither is. But the ‚Äùsomeone else can modify‚Äù problem exists just as much for a single entity, which is why a transaction is needed even for safe_login_counter . Without it, if two processes called safe_login_counter() at the same time with the same user_id, the db operations might end up interleaved in such a way that causes num_logins to end up incremented by 1, not by 2. The trouble with transactions While transactions are effective, they can be hard to use, particularly within Google App Engine. One problem is that transactions ‚Äùfreeze‚Äù the state of the datastore at the time the transaction starts, yielding surprising results. Suppose you have a function like this: {.python} @ndb.transactional def login_twice(user_id):     login_info = GetLoginInfo(user_id)     login_info.last_login = datetime.datetime.now()     login_info.put()     # Don't ask why, but we need to call this twice     safe_login_counter(user_id)     safe_login_counter(user_id) You might expect this to update num_logins by 2, but in fact it only updates it by 1, because when safe_login_counter calls get() , those call see the ‚Äùfrozen‚Äù datastore as it existed at the beginning of login_twice , ignoring the put() ‚Äôs that we did. While this example is somewhat contrived, such a scenario does come up (typically, as here, with nested transactions), and can be hard to debug. It comes up particularly with the older db interface, since ndb does some caching to try to ameliorate the problem. A second problem is that code inside transactions must be idempotent, since it is can be called more than once if the transaction needs to retry. This is particularly difficult to ensure when using transaction in relatively high-level code, which calls other functions that may not be aware they‚Äôre being called inside a transaction. ‚Äú` {.python} def update points after watching video(self, video):      # protect against this being called twice.      key = ‚Äòpoints updated.{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}s.{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6}s‚Äô {8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} (user.id, video.id)      if not memcache.get(key):          self.points += video.points value          memcache.set(key, True)   # UNSAFE @ndb.transactional def update after watching video(user id, video):     user = GetUser(user id)     user.update points after watching video(video)     video log = GetUserVideoLog(user)     video log.add watched video(video)     video log.put() ‚Äú` An equally serious problem is that you cannot do a datastore query inside a transaction: {.python} @ndb.transactional def update_videos_seen(user_id):     user = GetUser(user_id)     video_query = UserVideoLog.query().filter(         UserVideoLog.user == user,         UserVideoLog.finished_watching=True)     user.video_count += video_query.count()  # ILLEGAL     user.put() This restriction has hit Khan Academy hard. As with the idempotence requirement, it‚Äôs particularly onerous when using transactions in higher-level code, which calls helper functions that do queries. We have one API endpoint that we call when a user successfully completes an exercise, which updates a lot of state: the list of exercises a user has done, of course, but also their proficiency model, list of future recommended exercises, user notifications, etc. Many of these updates require datastore queries, often in helper functions buried deep in the call-stack. As a result, we cannot use transactions to atomically update the user-state upon exercise completion. Locking: a transaction alternative At Khan Academy, we have developed an alternative to transactions, which we are introducing today, complete with source code . This alternative uses a simple locking scheme in lieu of transactions. It works with transactions: for a given datastore model, you can decide if you want to use transactions or locking to protect its atomicity. If you have a function that updates two entities, one of which requires a transaction and the other of which requires a lock, you can make your function both transactional and lock-acquiring; the two can co-exist. Locks are a simple way to ensure atomicity for a single entity: while you hold the lock for an entity, nobody else can read or write the entity. It is easy to see how this ensures atomic operation. (This is a simplification; I discuss below how we allow concurrent read-only operations while a lock is being held.) As this simple description makes clear, locks have several disadvantages: Unless your locks are very fine-grained, forcing other applications to wait while you hold a lock is less efficient than transactions When acquiring multiple locks, you have to worry about deadlock Locks do not use rollbacks, meaning they cannot guarantee ‚Äùboth or neither‚Äù update semantics Writing a global lockservice is actually quite hard These problems are all solvable, as described below. And the advantages locks have ‚Äî intuitive data-access, no restrictions on datastore queries ‚Äî make them very appealing in the right situations. How our locks work The pubic API is very simple: {.python} class FinishedExercise(RequestHandler):     def get(self, user_id):         with lock_util.global_lock(key=user_id,                                    wait_timeout=5):             user = GetUser(user_id)             update_exercise_stats(user)             ... Now the finished-exercise API call will only run once it has acquired the lock for user_id from the lockservice. In the meantime, no other code that acquires the lock for user_id can run until this routine has finished. If we are unable to acquire the lock within 5 seconds, global_lock raises an exception. While I describe this mechanism as a ‚Äùlock‚Äù mechanism, it would be more accurately described as a lease: when you acquire the lock, the lockservice only promises it to you for a certain amount of time. This works well in the context of App Engine because App Engine will abort a request that takes too long (a minute for ‚Äùfrontend‚Äù requests, 10 minutes for ‚Äùbackend‚Äù requests). We hard-code that knowledge into lock_util , though you can override it using the lock_timeout parameter. By using a leasing model, we ensure that a bug or networking error can‚Äôt cause a lock to be held forever. The locking code logs when a lock was acquired and released, and if there was contention when acquiring it. This has had a surprising benefit to us: it‚Äôs made it significantly easier to diagnose the sources of contention than it was with transactions. When do locks make sense? Transactions are more efficient than locks because typically locks are too coarse. At Khan Academy, we use a single lock for a user, which protects all datastore entities associated with that user. So if one function wants to update a UserData entity, while the other wants to update a UserVideoLog entity, they could both run in parallel in a transaction world but would block each other in a locking world. A per-user lock works well for us because typically a Khan Academy user is only doing one thing at a time. So it‚Äôs unlikely that two processes would want to update two different user-specific entities in parallel. (But see ‚Äùbatch processing,‚Äù below.) In general we consider transactions to be superior to locks when they work: when a model only needs protection in idempotent, low-level, query-free code. When possible, we‚Äôll use transacations even for per-user models. Likewise, we‚Äôve never replaced existing uses of transactions with locks. Instead, we use locks to protect code that previously ran entirely unprotected. In our experience, a user lock is the most useful kind of lock to have: it‚Äôs unusual for two parallel requests to both be modifying information about a single user, and there are typically many datastore entities associated with a single user. Acquiring a single lock for the user at the beginning of the request can yield a lot of datastore safety with very little cognitive cost. Avoiding deadlock Whenever you acquire multiple locks at once, you have the potential for deadlock. At Khan Academy we attempt to avoid deadlock by having a canonical order in which we acquire locks: first we acquire the lock for the ‚Äùcurrent‚Äù user, then any children they have, then their coach, etc. If that doesn‚Äôt work, the deadlock will be broken when a lease expires. That said, only rarely do we need to acquire multiple locks in a single request. If we used more kinds of locks than just a user lock, this might become more of an issue. Using locks with transactions Locks do not guarantee ‚Äùboth or neither‚Äù semantics. Consider this code: {.python} def watched_video_locked(user_id, video):      with lock_util.acquire_lock(user_id):          user = GetUser(user_id)          user.num_videos_watched += 1          user.put()          video_log = GetUserVideoLog(user)          video_log.add_watched_video(video)          video_log.put() If add_watched_video throws an exception, we‚Äôll end up with num_videos_watched being updated but the video_log not being updated. The solution is simple: use a transaction as well. {.python} @ndb.transactional def watched_video_locked(user_id, video):      with lock_util.acquire_lock(user_id):          ... If we still have to use a transaction, what benefit is the lock? The answer is: we can use transactions more sparingly, in places where their restrictions are less onerous. In particular, at Khan Academy we now use transactions only in low-level code, after we‚Äôve done the datastore queries we need to do, and in addition we do not have to worry about all the problems (described above) that arise with ‚Äùnested‚Äù transactions. Our global lockservice: memcache Implementing a reliable, global lockservice is not a trivial task. Google has one it uses internally, called Chubby, but it is not made available to App Engine users. So we had to develop our own, application-layer lockservice. We did it using memcache. On the face of it, memcache is a terrible choice for a lockservice, because by design it does not guarantee that inserted items remain in the cache. It‚Äôs not very useful to have a lockservice that‚Äôs always forgetting about your locks! But in practice, this has not been a problem. Locks are very small, so are unlikely to fill a memcache by themselves. And any reasonable memcache implementation is going to evict old entries before new ones. Locks, by our design, are short-lived ‚Äî 10 minutes at most ‚Äìso are unlikely to be evicted. (To be sure, I would feel less confident were Khan Academy using a shared memcache instead of a dedicated instance.) The bigger problem with memcache is that you communicate with it over the network, and the network can be flaky. While memcache evictions have not been a problem, failed memcache writes are a fact of life for us. We have to be careful handling them, since we do not want our entire site to go down if memcache is unreachable. We‚Äôve chosen to continue optimistically ‚Äî assume we have the lock even though memcache has not confirmed it ‚Äî risking the potential for non-atomic writes in order to gain site reliability. On the plus side, memcache supports the operations a locking service needs: atomic reads and writes, shared state across processes, and fast access. We implement the locking via busy-waiting: we do an atomic memcache-create of the lock-key, and if it fails (meaning someone else is holding the lock), we wait a second and then try again. Once it succeeds, we hold the lock. At the end of the request, we do an atomic memcache-delete to release the lock. The ‚Äùlease‚Äù functionality comes automatically with memcache: when we create the memcache entry, we do so with a timeout, causing memcache to automatically flush the entry if we do not manually delete it first. Batch processing I mentioned above that the user-lock works well for us because typically only one process is trying to access a single user at a time. There‚Äôs one big exception to this rule though: batch processes that run over all our users. For instance, we have a nightly cronjob that can award users time-based badges (‚ÄùYou‚Äôve used Khan Academy every day this month!‚Äù). It‚Äôs very possible for a user‚Äôs interactive requests to run at the same time as the batch request hits that user. To maintain interactive behavior in that situation, we have a simple form of lock priority: locks can either say they are for interactive tasks, or batch tasks. (In practice, we determine this automatically based on the url of the current request, but it could easily be an input parameter.) We implement the priority scheme by having batch processes wait 1.1 seconds before first trying to acquire the lock. Since any concurrent client for the lock is retrying the memcache-create once a second, this guarantees anyone else waiting will have a chance to acquire the lock before the batch process does. While interactive processes can still starve each other, batch processes cannot starve interactive ones. Allowing read-only datastore access There remains one final situation I promised to address: what to do with read-only access. You don‚Äôt need to acquire a lock for read-only access, and in general you don‚Äôt want to, so that two processes can read the same data the same time. The trouble is the code can‚Äôt tell a priori that an access is going to be read-only (and indeed, a data access in a low-level function might be read-only in some cases but part of a read-write pattern in others). We could require applications to tell the locking system if an access was read-only or not, but that‚Äôs onerous and brittle. We‚Äôd like to do what transactions do, and automatically figure out if a read was read-only or not at write-time, and to handle things appropriately in either case. We can‚Äôt do that, but we can get close, by using runtime assertions. Our basic scheme is to allow a process to read an entity without holding the lock. That is, we assume all reads are made by read-only processes. But we also keep track of the fact that that process has read that entity without holding a lock. If the process then ever tries to put() the entity, we notice it had done a prior read without a lock, and complain loudly at that time. The fundamental idea here is that a process has to know if an entity-read might lead to a subsequent write. If so, it is the application‚Äôs responsibility to acquire the lock before the read. We have some runtime checks to make sure that happens. But wait, there‚Äôs more‚Ä¶ How these runtime checks are implemented in App Engine is a fascinating story in its own right. Stay tuned for our next blog post, where I talk about that in a lot more detail. In the meantime, if you‚Äôre interested in the source code for our locking scheme, have at it ! The uber-high-level [fetch under user write lock()]{.title-ref} function requires some code from the next blog post, but the rest of it is usable today.", "date": "2016-06-20"},

Most software engineers I know have a strong creative impulse ‚Äì so strong, in fact, that no matter how interesting our workdays, we can‚Äôt help thinking about unexplored software frontiers in our downtime. For example, we make open-source contributions , start independent projects , and some gather with friends for hackathons. As a company we recognize that this innate drive for creativity exists and that letting everyone on the team (not just engineers) express it can bring the team closer and make the company substantially better. This is why twice a year we take a break from our projects so we can focus on our internal company hackathon . Why hold a hackathon? Clearly, hackathons are a fun and exciting event: Hackers form teams to collaborate on projects, share ideas over catered lunch and dinner, and demo something amazing. Winners are chosen, and sometimes the ideas become real products later on, but this isn‚Äôt the hackathon‚Äôs goal. Reflecting on our favorite experiences, we found that being able to work with others you don‚Äôt normally work with is a good way for the team to get to know each other better and bond a bit more. We also feel a sense of release of pent-up energy and a morale boost as all the constraints of building production systems and careful design and testing fall away. Most importantly, it allows individuals and the organization as a whole to learn a bunch of new things and explore areas that were previously unknown. However, hackathons can have a bit of a dark side . Traditionally, they run through the night, provide primarily junk food like pizza and energy drinks, and are generally unfriendly to those who might have families or responsibilities outside of work. As a team committed to sustainable, healthy lifestyles, we choose not to subject ourselves to this. That‚Äôs why we branded our first internal hackathon the ‚Äú Khan Academy Healthy Hackathon ‚Äù back in 2012. Of course, just calling a hackathon ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it so. Over the years, we‚Äôve experimented with several formats to find the one that feels most inclusive (everyone in the company can participate) and sustainable (everyone is rested and healthy at the end and can resume a normal schedule immediately). We tried a few different formats; here‚Äôs some of what we learned: 1. It‚Äôs not that hard to be healthy Our methodology is simple: Kick everyone out at 11:45pm and don‚Äôt allow them back in until 9:30am. (Do people cheat? Probably, yes. But working through the night is definitely not the norm.) Cater healthy meals for lunch and dinner. No piles of junk food or energy drinks. Schedule breaks to do yoga, outdoor activities, or improv to get people out of their seats periodically. Don‚Äôt take things too seriously: 2. ‚ÄúHack weeks‚Äù are more inclusive, but weekend hackathons feel more relaxed I have a family at home and obligations that often keep me from attending weekend events at work. I‚Äôm not against having a company hackathon that starts Friday night and runs through Sunday, but having one that I can also attend feels great and gives me a chance to share my ideas as well. Our initial take at an alternative was a week-long (Friday to Friday) Healthy Hack Week, which meant that everyone could attend at least 5 days, with some coming in over the weekend as well. The consensus was that, fun though it might have been, there was a definite decline in energy around Wednesday and productivity fell noticeably. I also observed that a lot of projects were scoped far more optimistically than a two-day project would be (‚Äúthink what we can get done in a whole week!‚Äù) and the result was a few projects that weren‚Äôt ready for a demo at the end. This year we compromised and for our first hackathon in February we scheduled it Monday to Friday, which felt very natural and was fairly easy to plan for in advance. All running projects could simply omit that week from their planning, and all meetings were canceled. The other side of the compromise is to still do a weekend hackathon in July (this week in fact!), when the summer interns will be able to join in. This has the advantage that it won‚Äôt require us to sacrifice another whole week from all our projects (interns are with us for precious few weeks in the first place) and it has a more relaxed feel since it‚Äôs outside work hours. 3. Brainstorming is best done in advance Have you guessed yet? This February we happened to have Hack Week scheduled the week after our company off-site. One of the activities during the off-site was to draw our ideas on post-it boards and hang them around the room, science fair style. The goal was to drum up support for the really cool ideas and get people to collaborate on them. This was wildly successful and got everybody totally pumped to work together. We had also just spent a lot of time discussing company goals and strategy, and so everyone‚Äôs mind was laser focused on the critical challenges facing Khan Academy in the coming year. As a result, almost all the projects seemed to explore and inform the direction our existing and upcoming products were heading. While some demos were prototypes of technologies we would later ship (including one project that provided a blueprint for a major performance improvement initiative), others were educational, thought-provoking or inspirational. 4. A theme can go a surprisingly long way When planning our Healthy Hack Week, the discussion quickly turned to planning a theme for the decor and events. I must admit I was skeptical at first that this was necessary, especially when we settled on a theme having to do with a certain fictional wizard . There is, in fact, no particular connection between what we do and that fantasy world, so I figured it would just be good fun to dress up and everyone would quickly forget and focus on their projects. The reality was much, much better than that. Immediately once the theme was suggested, we hit upon the idea of sorting everyone in the company into houses (yes there was a sorting hat and a ceremony, and yes it was a riot). That led to the idea of being able to award points to the houses, and since no one felt particularly qualified to dole these out our own Eli Feasley built a Slack bot as a pre-hackathon hack project to track the house points. Here is how it actually turned out: J.K. Rowling please don‚Äôt sue us This was probably the most surprising highlight of the hackathon: a simple bot and some randomly-assigned teams led to spontaneous outbursts of appreciation and recognition between team members! Folks from across the organization who happened to be assigned the same house had something in common and something to talk about at lunch, sitting under their house‚Äôs banner. It was actually a little bit painful to go back to work as usual, and there was a strong temptation to keep the houses long-term. We may yet bring the idea back in some form, if only for the next hackathon. Hackathons are one of my favorite things we do at Khan Academy and have been the source of some of our most creative and thought-provoking new ideas. If you are planning a hackathon yourself I hope you find some of these findings helpful. If you do, drop me a line (tom at khanacademy.org) and let me know how it turned out!

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Interning at Khan Academy: from student to intern", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/interning-at-khan-academy-from-student-to-intern/", "abstract": "By Shadaj Laddad This past summer I had the amazing opportunity to work on a product I use as a student every day: Khan Academy. During my internship, I worked on the web frontend team on the amusingly-named X-on-Mobile initiative (XOM) to bring Khan Academy exercises to mobile devices. In this blog post, I‚Äôll be going through a highly-compressed summary of my two months at Khan Academy. Part 1: Ramping up My first day at Khan Academy was a whirlwind of activities. From setting up my laptop to having a 1:1 with my mentor and finally adding myself to the interns page , I had a lot of things to do. As soon as I settled down with my first deploy, I got to work on the XOM initiative, starting with improving the math keypad. As part of XOM, the team had designed a math keypad that could be used to type in expression responses to mathematics problems in a mobile-friendly way. I started by fixing some bugs, such as disabling gestures on the keypad‚Äôs sidebar, which has navigation buttons that cannot be swiped around like the other keys. Once I had a good idea of how the keypad worked, I was able to start working on adding new features our designers had crafted such as using square icons for representing empty blocks. And, by working on these low-level details, I learned the difference between a good user experience and a great user experience: polish. At Khan Academy, we use React, something I had worked with before, but only in the context of Scala.js applications. As part of making changes to the math keypad, I had to learn how to write idiomatic ES6 code. Working on Khan Academy gave me a great opportunity to use React with ES6 in a production environment, and left me with many ideas on how React.js could be used more seamlessly with Scala.js. For example, seeing how properties could be easily reused for different components in ES6 gave me ideas of different ways to model properties in Scala.js. In addition to learning React and ES6, I got a chance to work with the plethora of open-source libraries at Khan Academy. For example, I often used Aphrodite to style React components, with which I learned how easy it is to use inline styles to bring your CSS styles and JavaScript code closer together. an early screenshot of changes to the math keypad Part 2: iframes, iframes, iframes Now that I was used to the flow of picking a task, creating a code review, and deploying my changes, I started on my first project: improving our content editor to be mobile first. Historically, our content creators have worked primarily on desktop: they write their content on desktop, they preview their content on desktop, they review each other‚Äôs work on desktop, they check their email on desktop. How can we make it easy for our content creators to build content for mobile first, and thereby avoid awful small-screen layout bugs, but still allow them to take advantage of the big-screen multi-tasking perks of desktop devices? This involved pulling together specs for what types of devices students use Khan Academy on, rendering content with the new styles the rest of the team was working on, isolating the rendered content to prevent styles leaking from the rest of the editor, and implementing touch emulation for interacting with the mobile previews. To implement the isolation of content, I decided to render previews inside of iframes. In addition to providing style isolation, iframes also made it possible to properly render components that are rendered directly to the body, such as the math keypad I worked on earlier. But to work with iframes, I now had to make sure that the iframes showed live previews while maintaining the speed of the preview updates. Having quick preview updates meant that iframe reloads had to be minimized and communication between the editor and preview frames needed to be as fast as possible. To transfer data between the parent editor and the child iframe, the parent first stores a JS object representation of the exercise content in a global variable, because the exercise content contains callback functions which prevent it from being serialized for window messaging. The parent then sends a message ( http://ejohn.org/blog/cross-window-messaging/ ) to the iframe, notifying it of the updated content. When the iframe receives this message, it grabs the exercise content from the global variable from the parent and renders that content. The browser only allows this because the iframe and parent are on the same domain. With this implementation, preview updates happen immediately after content edits. In addition, iframe loads are minimized with a custom shouldComponentUpdate method that only allows full reloads for switching form factor or enabling/disabling touch emulation. In most cases, the only delay happens during the initial editor load. live-updated interactive mobile previews with iframes! After these changes were implemented, I got the chance to work with content creators to test out my changes and make sure they didn‚Äôt interrupt their creation process. By working with content creators, I was able to understand exactly what they were hoping to get out of my changes, and I was able to tune the goals of my project to these needs to make sure that it was helping the content creators as much as possible. For example, I learned that content creators often take screenshots of the editor for annotating content, which resulted in changes to the editor to make sure that all preview content was always visible with no scrolling. With all the kinks worked out, I was able to finally deploy the content editor that is now used by content creators every day! Even as I continued on to my next project, content creators continued to provide feedback that was worked through and helped further refine the editor. Part 3: crispEdges for the win! Moving on from the mobile-first content editor, I began work on my next project: making KA‚Äôs interactive graphing widgets work on mobile devices. Since new designs for the mobile widgets were needed to make graphs fit in with our visual language in other mobile experiences, I worked with Louis, a fellow intern, on the design. On Khan Academy, interactive graphs are rendered with SVGs, so most of my work dealt with rendering the SVG elements for different graph parts with the new styles. some changes to the graph widget: larger points and deletion tooltips One of the most interesting things I learned in this project was the shape-rendering CSS style. On SVG elements, you can apply the shape-rendering style to give the renderer hints on what to prioritize when rendering the elements. In the case of this project, I used the shape-rendering property with the crispEdges value to make lines render more crisply. This is especially useful for grid lines, which sit perfectly horizontal and vertical. By setting crispEdges on these lines, the renderer knows to render them lined up with pixel rows instead of blurring the line to higher and lower rows. On mobile devices, especially those with higher resolutions, this small change makes a large difference in how the graphs look. if you look closely, you can see the effects of crispEdges here Conclusion All in all, my internship at Khan Academy was an amazing experience. It gave me the opportunity to have an impact on learners around the world and learn many new technologies. From building new tools for content editors to creating a brand new experience for students using interactive graphs, I was able to work in a wide variety of areas. I‚Äôm super thankful to my mentor Kevin for all his help throughout my internship, the XOM team for being super encouraging on all my projects, my fellow interns for great lunchtime discussions, and the entire Khan Academy team for creating such a great place to work. Onward! P.S. since most of my work here was in open-source projects you can check out my work in detail on GitHub ( 1 , 2 )", "date": "2016-12-12"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Automating App Store Screenshots", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/automating-app-store-screenshots/", "abstract": "By Bryan Clark One of the more tedious design tasks is keeping your App Store promo images up-to-date. As you add localization support and new features, it can mean taking a few days of a designer‚Äôs time to update these design assets. Our iOS app is currently available in 6 languages. Recently, we improved our iPhone app‚Äôs downloading feature, and changed its name from ‚ÄúYour List‚Äù to ‚ÄúBookmarks‚Äù. A minor change ‚Äì a few strings and a tab bar icon ‚Äì but it meant we needed to update lots of screenshots in the App Store! 5 screenshots * 4 phone sizes * 6 locales = 180 images If you‚Äôre an iOS designer, this is a major headache: If your App Store screenshots are really handmade Sketch artboards, then you need to manually update 180 artboards ‚Äì and make sure that the other features in the app‚Äôs design are kept up to date! Localization is a big pain here. If your App Store screenshots are real screenshots, then you‚Äôre looking at a long week of loading up different user profiles in different languages to take screenshots. Either way, that‚Äôs probably a tedious few days‚Äô worth of somebody‚Äôs time ‚Äì which is a hard expense to justify if you‚Äôre shipping every few weeks! The result: your App Store images are either out of date, or your team is spending too much effort on this task. A couple of months ago, our mobile team spent time automating our screenshots for the App Store and the Play Store. Now, when we want to update our App Store screenshots, this task now takes about an hour instead of a week ‚Äì and almost all of that time is waiting for automated tests to compile and run. To pull this off, we used Fastlane‚Äôs snapshot tool, and a homegrown Sketch file. Let‚Äôs dig in! Step One: Write UI Tests UI testing in Xcode is awesome ‚Äì the tests are quite easy to write (they can literally write themselves with a ‚Äúrecord me‚Äù feature) When you run ‚Äòem, your app flies through its paces in the simulator. Then, at the right moment, snapshot records a screenshot and files it away. Let‚Äôs take a look at the UI test that takes a screenshot of our Bookmarks tab: func testPhoneBookmarks() {\n    // Skip the test if snapshot's locale is empty         \n    guard !locale.isEmpty else { return }       \n    \n    // Tell the iOS app we'd like to populate the Bookmarks tab      \n    // with test content       \n    let environment = AppStoreScreenshotUITests.screenshotEnvironment(plus: [             \n        KHAUITestingConstants.showAppStoreBookmarksEnvironmentVariable: KHAUITestingConstants.enableKey,             \n        KHAUITestingConstants.localeCodeEnvironmentVariable: locale          \n    ])          \n\n    // Launch the app in the simulator        \n    launch(with: environment)        \n\n    // Tap on the Bookmarks tab (tab #3)         \n    XCUIApplication().tabBars.buttons.element(boundBy: 2).tap()         \n    // Take a screenshot!         \n    Screenshot.appStoreBookmarks.take()    \n} What‚Äôs up with that last line, though? Screenshot is a little enum that handles telling snapshot when to take a picture, and what the image should be called. It looks like this: /// Identifiers for screenshots that we want to take. \n/// The App Store cases are uniquely identified, and numbered by their display order in the App Store. \n/// Use the `.test(string)` case for one-off test shots, e.g. `.test(\"ProfileUnauthenticated\")`. \ninternal enum Screenshot {     \n    case appStoreExplore, appStoreVideo, appStoreBookmarks, appStoreExercise, appStoreUserProfile\n    case test(String)\n    \n    var imageName: String {         \n        switch self {         \n        case .appStoreExplore:             \n            return \"AppStore_01_Explore\"         \n        case .appStoreExercise:             \n            return \"AppStore_02_Exercise\"         \n        case .appStoreBookmarks:             \n            return \"AppStore_03_Bookmarks\"         \n        case .appStoreVideo:             \n            return \"AppStore_04_Video\"         \n        case .appStoreUserProfile:             \n            return \"AppStore_05_UserProfile\"\n        case .test(let screenshotName):             \n            return \"Test_\" + screenshotName         \n        }    \n    }      \n        \n    func take() {\n        // this is a global function from `snapshot`         \n        snapshot(imageName)      \n    }\n} Step Two: Create your Snapfile The Snapfile is where you configure snapshot ‚Äôs run. Ours looks like this: # Check out this link for what to put in this file: \n# https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/snapshot/README.md#snapfile  \nscheme \"Khan Academy.UITests\" \noutput_directory \"./app-store-screenshots/snapshot-output\" \nclear_previous_screenshots true \nreinstall_app true \nlocalize_simulator true \nworkspace \"./Khan Academy.xcworkspace\" \napp_identifier \"org.khanacademy.Khan-Academy\"  \ndevices([\n    \"iPhone 7\",   \n    \"iPhone 7 Plus\",   \n    \"iPhone SE\" \n])  \nlanguages([   \n    \"en-US\",  \n    \"fr\",  \n    \"es-ES\", \n    \"nb\", \n    \"pt_BR\", \n    \"tr\" \n]) Step Three: Render mock data in your app So, we‚Äôve got UI tests written, and snapshot is able to grab screenshots at the right moment. The problem is ‚Äì how do you get beautiful content in there? One tricky thing about UI tests: you have a very limited ability to pass information into your iOS app. This is intentional ‚Äì UI tests would be pretty weird if you could write code that directly manipulated views in your app! To send information into the running app, we use environment variables ‚Äì which are basically just strings that the app can then read when it launches. Remember the bit above with KHAUITestingConstants ? When the app is running, we check to see if the environment contains a given variable, like so: /// Checks NSProcessInfo for environment variables used by UI Testing. \n/// If there are environment variables for a content item, the app will navigate to that location. \n@objc func openUITestingContentIfApplicable() {    \n    let environment = NSProcessInfo.processInfo().environment      \n    let shouldOpenContent = environment[KHAUITestingConstants.shouldOpenContentEnvironmentVariable] == KHAUITestingConstants.enableKey      \n    \n    if shouldOpenContent {         \n        if             \n            let contentSlug = environment[KHAUITestingConstants.contentItemSlugVariable],\n            let contentTypeString = environment[KHAUITestingConstants.contentItemTypeVariable],\n            let contentType = URLTarget.contentTypeFromURLComponent(contentTypeString)\n        {             \n            // Here's where our app navigates to the desired content.\n            let urlTarget = URLTarget.ContentItem(contentType: contentType, slug: contentSlug)\n            self.navigateToURLTarget(urlTarget)         \n        }     \n    } \n} We‚Äôve also got structs that contain good-looking content for each locale. For example, this struct populates our app‚Äôs bookmark tab with the right content for each locale: /// Contains good-looking topics and videos for the Bookmarks tab in our automated App Store screenshots. \ninternal struct AppStoreScreenshotBookmarks {      \n    /// Returns a list of video slugs for App Store screenshots.     \n    internal static func contentSlugsForLocale(\n        locale: ScreenshotLocale\n    ) -> [String] {         \n    switch locale {\n    case .en_US, .tr, .es_ES:\n        return [\n            \"matisse-blue-window\",\n            \"introduction-to-vectors-and-scalars\",\n            \"circulatory-system-and-the-heart\",                 \n            \"introduction-to-economics\",                 \n            \"introduction-to-physics\",\n        ]            \n    // etc.     \n    }       \n\n    /// Returns a list of topic slugs for App Store screenshots.     \n    internal static func topicSlugsForLocale(\n        locale: ScreenshotLocale\n    ) -> [String] {\n        switch locale {         \n        case .en_US, .tr, .fr, .pt_BR:\n            return [                 \n                \"trigonometry\",\n                \"entropy-chemistry-sal\",\n            ]\n        // etc.     \n    } \n} Step Four: Custom Layouts Now you‚Äôve got great content in your screenshots for each locale ‚Äì what do you want to do with them? For Khan Academy‚Äôs app, we want to inset the phone in a device, and have some text above it, like so: Fastlane offers a tool called frameit that gets you pretty close ‚Äì but we wanted more control over the layout and background color, so I created a Sketch File that nearly-automates this step. I won‚Äôt go too in-depth into breaking down the Sketch file, but here‚Äôs a quick overview of how it‚Äôs built: ‚Äì It uses a Sketch plugin called Sketch Replace Images , which updates image layers in the Sketch file to match similarly-named images in our snapshot output. ‚Äì It uses Symbols and Shared Styles to keep the design consistent across all 180 screenshots. ‚Äì We used the beautiful Devices sketch files from Facebook Design , and stripped out the shadows, textures, and colors to create our stylized white devices ‚Äì then scaled them down and pixel-snapped the edges. Our Sketch file has one-page-per-device, and looks like this: Putting it all together Now, when we want to update our screenshots, we can type in a Terminal command, and wait about 30 minutes (Swift compilation is responsible for the vast majority of that time; our Android app only takes a few minutes to do this part). Then, we open our Sketch file, run the Sketch Replace Images plugin, and export our screens ‚Äì that‚Äôs it! Want to learn more? Fastlane.tools provides snapshot and other tools for automating app development tasks. WWDC 2015, Session 406: UI Testing in Xcode Felix Krause has a great talk on other things you can build with automated screenshots ‚Äì like automatically-adding ‚Äòem to each pull request! func testPhoneBookmarks() {\n    // Skip the test if snapshot's locale is empty         \n    guard !locale.isEmpty else { return }       \n    \n    // Tell the iOS app we'd like to populate the Bookmarks tab      \n    // with test content       \n    let environment = AppStoreScreenshotUITests.screenshotEnvironment(plus: [             \n        KHAUITestingConstants.showAppStoreBookmarksEnvironmentVariable: KHAUITestingConstants.enableKey,             \n        KHAUITestingConstants.localeCodeEnvironmentVariable: locale          \n    ])          \n\n    // Launch the app in the simulator        \n    launch(with: environment)        \n\n    // Tap on the Bookmarks tab (tab #3)         \n    XCUIApplication().tabBars.buttons.element(boundBy: 2).tap()         \n    // Take a screenshot!         \n    Screenshot.appStoreBookmarks.take()    \n} /// Identifiers for screenshots that we want to take. \n/// The App Store cases are uniquely identified, and numbered by their display order in the App Store. \n/// Use the `.test(string)` case for one-off test shots, e.g. `.test(\"ProfileUnauthenticated\")`. \ninternal enum Screenshot {     \n    case appStoreExplore, appStoreVideo, appStoreBookmarks, appStoreExercise, appStoreUserProfile\n    case test(String)\n    \n    var imageName: String {         \n        switch self {         \n        case .appStoreExplore:             \n            return \"AppStore_01_Explore\"         \n        case .appStoreExercise:             \n            return \"AppStore_02_Exercise\"         \n        case .appStoreBookmarks:             \n            return \"AppStore_03_Bookmarks\"         \n        case .appStoreVideo:             \n            return \"AppStore_04_Video\"         \n        case .appStoreUserProfile:             \n            return \"AppStore_05_UserProfile\"\n        case .test(let screenshotName):             \n            return \"Test_\" + screenshotName         \n        }    \n    }      \n        \n    func take() {\n        // this is a global function from `snapshot`         \n        snapshot(imageName)      \n    }\n} # Check out this link for what to put in this file: \n# https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/snapshot/README.md#snapfile  \nscheme \"Khan Academy.UITests\" \noutput_directory \"./app-store-screenshots/snapshot-output\" \nclear_previous_screenshots true \nreinstall_app true \nlocalize_simulator true \nworkspace \"./Khan Academy.xcworkspace\" \napp_identifier \"org.khanacademy.Khan-Academy\"  \ndevices([\n    \"iPhone 7\",   \n    \"iPhone 7 Plus\",   \n    \"iPhone SE\" \n])  \nlanguages([   \n    \"en-US\",  \n    \"fr\",  \n    \"es-ES\", \n    \"nb\", \n    \"pt_BR\", \n    \"tr\" \n]) /// Checks NSProcessInfo for environment variables used by UI Testing. \n/// If there are environment variables for a content item, the app will navigate to that location. \n@objc func openUITestingContentIfApplicable() {    \n    let environment = NSProcessInfo.processInfo().environment      \n    let shouldOpenContent = environment[KHAUITestingConstants.shouldOpenContentEnvironmentVariable] == KHAUITestingConstants.enableKey      \n    \n    if shouldOpenContent {         \n        if             \n            let contentSlug = environment[KHAUITestingConstants.contentItemSlugVariable],\n            let contentTypeString = environment[KHAUITestingConstants.contentItemTypeVariable],\n            let contentType = URLTarget.contentTypeFromURLComponent(contentTypeString)\n        {             \n            // Here's where our app navigates to the desired content.\n            let urlTarget = URLTarget.ContentItem(contentType: contentType, slug: contentSlug)\n            self.navigateToURLTarget(urlTarget)         \n        }     \n    } \n} /// Contains good-looking topics and videos for the Bookmarks tab in our automated App Store screenshots. \ninternal struct AppStoreScreenshotBookmarks {      \n    /// Returns a list of video slugs for App Store screenshots.     \n    internal static func contentSlugsForLocale(\n        locale: ScreenshotLocale\n    ) -> [String] {         \n    switch locale {\n    case .en_US, .tr, .es_ES:\n        return [\n            \"matisse-blue-window\",\n            \"introduction-to-vectors-and-scalars\",\n            \"circulatory-system-and-the-heart\",                 \n            \"introduction-to-economics\",                 \n            \"introduction-to-physics\",\n        ]            \n    // etc.     \n    }       \n\n    /// Returns a list of topic slugs for App Store screenshots.     \n    internal static func topicSlugsForLocale(\n        locale: ScreenshotLocale\n    ) -> [String] {\n        switch locale {         \n        case .en_US, .tr, .fr, .pt_BR:\n            return [                 \n                \"trigonometry\",\n                \"entropy-chemistry-sal\",\n            ]\n        // etc.     \n    } \n}", "date": "2017-03-27"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "The Original Serverless Architecture is Still Here", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/the-original-serverless-architecture-is-still-here/", "abstract": "By Kevin Dangoor This month, my colleague Dave Rosile and I went to GlueCon 2018 in sunny Denver, Colorado. The organizers did a fantastic job putting together a conference around modern server architectures. In talking about those architectures, there were a bunch of talks related to container orchestration (which is now synonymous with Kubernetes ), and serverless approaches . Kubernetes gives you flexibility Kubernetes and the ecosystem around it strike me as something distinctly different from what we had in the decades before it. Starting with Docker containers as a common format for deploying complete and immutable images of software, Kubernetes layers on management of those containers to start and stop them as needed. Docker is still relatively low-level, describing only one container, so there‚Äôs Helm to help package up larger solutions. There are a few ‚Äúingress controllers‚Äù to manage traffic coming into a Kubernetes service, and a number of ways to monitor what‚Äôs going on within your Kubernetes clusters (for example, Prometheus and InfluxDB ). There‚Äôs even Istio and other service mesh solutions to control how your services talk to one another. And none of this ties you to a single company‚Äôs cloud. That ecosystem is powerful and flexible, enabling you to put together whatever collection of software you think is right for the job at hand. Flexibility doesn‚Äôt come free, though. In some cases, you‚Äôll have to choose among several options, and some of the tools are less mature than others. Once you‚Äôre done, you can end up with a finely tuned collection of services that efficiently deliver what your users want. But it takes work and you‚Äôll likely stub your toes a couple of times getting there. All of the excitement and development around Kubernetes today means that future engineers will likely be able to build efficient, manageable services without the toe stubbing. Serverless lets you focus on your application ‚ÄúServerless‚Äù architectures have been built around services like Firebase , which allow developers to build client applications that connect to a server infrastructure the developer doesn‚Äôt need to manage. More recently, serverless has come to encompass ‚Äúfunctions as a service,‚Äù most notably Amazon‚Äôs Lambda . With Lambda, you‚Äôre still writing server-side code, but just in functions that take in data and send out a result, with the ‚Äúserver‚Äù part of it completely abstracted away. These functions are stateless and connect to services like DynamoDB or Aurora for persistence. A single function likely can‚Äôt act as a whole backend for an application. Building a serverless app therefore often includes creating multiple functions, setting up an API Gateway , perhaps some queues and Step Functions to glue things together, X-Ray for debugging, etc. All of those services are fully managed and scalable and don‚Äôt require the same attention to resource usage that Kubernetes does. Serverless frameworks (including Serverless , Up , and .architect ) help provide the glue and make local development easier. Theoretically, if you build an application around functions, you can deploy a change in seconds , which is pretty cool. Functions-as-a-service (FaaS) takes the microservice idea as far as it can go (assuming no one‚Äôs about to introduce ‚Äúline of code as a service‚Äù), making deployment units as small as can be, with the complexity coming in the form of coordination between those units. In addition to the simple scaling offered by serverless, you also win by only paying for what you use. You don‚Äôt need to have frontend and database server instances running when nothing is happening on your site. A Kubernetes-based system could conceivably win on cost by building services that are finely tuned for your use cases. But that tuning takes effort and, without that effort, you‚Äôre more likely to be reserving more instances than a serverless implementation would. Serverless frameworks today are young and largely tied to a single cloud provider, but over time I suspect we‚Äôll see even easier ways to glue together autoscaling services from whichever providers give you the features you need. The serverless architecture used at Khan Academy Why do people want serverless architectures? In my opinion, the reason to opt for a serverless architecture is because you want to focus on your application code and not focus on the infrastructure around building reliable, scalable services. From the get-go, Khan Academy wanted a system that could scale as our usage increased, without requiring us to scale an operations team to match. Back when we started, the term ‚Äúserverless‚Äù didn‚Äôt even exist and there were only a handful of services that would help you autoscale, notably Heroku and Google App Engine. We chose App Engine. Today, Google compares App Engine to the new serverless frameworks, because it bundles local development , data persistence (through Datastore ), monitoring and debugging (through Stackdriver ), and other features in simple, deployable units. You can even do microservices with App Engine . App Engine has evolved over time, adding Node to the supported languages on the Standard Environment , with the Flexible Environment going even further with support for custom Docker containers. A framework like .architect pulls together the setup of a whole collection of AWS services to provide a cohesive experience. App Engine, too, was built to give developers an all-inclusive experience, and it provides that experience whether you‚Äôre deploying a single 100-line file or a much larger application. I‚Äôm excited about all of the work going on around Kubernetes and function-based server architectures. The Kubernetes ecosystem is working out ways to provide tons of flexibility while improving manageability of services. The serverless crowd is working out new ways to spin up microservices where the hardware and networking is abstracted away. While these new technologies mature, our original serverless setup of App Engine continues to work well for us. That said, whether you‚Äôre deploying to App Engine or EC2 today, I think it‚Äôs important to keep an eye on the fast-moving orchestration space.  We‚Äôre rapidly moving toward a world in which you can deploy applications constructed of just the services you need, with far greater cloud independence.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Introducing SwiftTweaks", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/introducing-swifttweaks/", "abstract": "By Bryan Clark Today, we‚Äôre releasing SwiftTweaks , a way to adjust your Swift-based iOS app without needing to recompile. Your users won‚Äôt see your animation study, Sketch comps, or prototypes. What they will see is the finished product ‚Äì so it‚Äôs really important to make sure that your app feels right on a real device! Animations that look great on your laptop often feel too slow when in-hand. Layouts that looks perfect on a 27-inch display might be too cramped on a 4-inch device. Light gray text may look subtle in Sketch, but it‚Äôs downright illegible when you‚Äôre outside on a sunny day. For these reasons, it‚Äôs helpful to fine-tune your designs on-device ‚Äì but that‚Äôs a lot of work: open Xcode, tweak your code, and wait for the app to build to device before seeing the results. What about Facebook Tweaks? In Objective-C projects, I‚Äôve cherished Facebook‚Äôs Tweaks , a tool that makes this process easy. However, while it‚Äôs possible to use FBTweaks in Swift, it‚Äôs far less convenient than in Objective-C. Since Khan Academy ‚Äôs iOS code is almost entirely Swift, we wanted something that would make it easy to use tweaks. (Plus: with Swift‚Äôs generic types, protocols, and all-around awesomeness, we figured we could make some improvements.) We‚Äôve been using SwiftTweaks for a few months now in our iOS app, and it‚Äôs been wonderful for fine-tuning gestures, adjusting animations, and toggling feature flags. Using SwiftTweaks Create a TweakLibrary First, you create a TweakLibrary , which contains Tweaks and a TweakStore . (If TweakStore.enabled is false, then the Tweaks UI will be inaccessible and all tweaks return their default value ‚Äì which means you can leave this code in-place when you ship your production app.) public struct ExampleTweaks: TweakLibraryType { \n    public static let colorTint = Tweak(‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúColors‚Äù, ‚ÄúTint‚Äù, UIColor.blueColor()) \n    public static let marginHorizontal = Tweak(‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúLayout‚Äù, ‚ÄúH. Margins‚Äù, defaultValue: 15, min: 0) \n    public static let marginVertical = Tweak(‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúLayout‚Äù, ‚ÄúV. Margins‚Äù, defaultValue: 10, min: 0) \n    public static let featureFlag = Tweak(‚ÄúFeature Flags‚Äù, ‚ÄúMain Screen‚Äù, ‚ÄúShow Body Text‚Äù, true)\n\n    public static let buttonAnimation = SpringAnimationTweakTemplate(\"Animation\", \"Button Animation\")  \n    public static let defaultStore: TweakStore = {     \n        let allTweaks: [TweakType] = [colorTint, marginHorizontal, marginVertical, featureFlag]      \n        \n        #if DEBUG         \n            let tweaksEnabled: Bool = true     \n        #else         \n            let tweaksEnabled: Bool = false     \n        #endif      \n        \n        return TweakStore(         \n            tweaks: allTweaks.map(AnyTweak.init),         \n            enabled: tweaksEnabled     \n        ) }() \n} Calling Tweaks in your code When you want to use a tweak in your code, use the assign , bind, and bindMultiple functions. assign returns the current value of the tweak: button.tintColor = ExampleTweaks.assign(ExampleTweaks.colorTint) bind calls its closure immediately, and again each time the tweak changes: ExampleTweaks.bind(ExampleTweaks.colorTint) { button.tintColor = $0 } bindMultiple calls its closure immediately, and again each time any of its tweaks change: // A \"multipleBind\" is called initially, and each time _any_ of the included tweaks change: \n let tweaksToWatch: [TweakType] = [ExampleTweaks.marginHorizontal, ExampleTweaks.marginVertical] \n ExampleTweaks.bindMultiple(tweaksToWatch) {     \n     let horizontal = ExampleTweaks.assign(ExampleTweaks.marginHorizontal)     \n     let vertical = ExampleTweaks.assign(ExampleTweaks.marginVertical)     \n     scrollView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: vertical, right: horizontal, bottom: vertical, left: horizontal) \n} There are also several handy TweakGroupTemplate types, to help you with commonly-tweaked things. Our above ExampleTweaks library included one for a UIView spring animation: public static let buttonAnimation = SpringAnimationTweakTemplate(\"Animation\", \"Button Animation\") This single line of code creates four tweaks ‚Äì for duration, delay, damping, and initial spring velocity. Each has sensible defaults (e.g. ‚Äúdelay can‚Äôt be negative‚Äù) ‚Äì and there‚Äôs a UIView extension to easily use the TweakGroup : UIView.animateWithSpringAnimationTweakTemplate For more on using Tweaks and TweakGroupTemplates, check out the example project . Accessing the interface Lastly, we need a way to adjust our Tweaks while the app is running. The simplest way is to set your app‚Äôs UIWindow to be a TweakWindow . By default, the TweakWindow presents a TweaksViewController when you shake the device in a debug build, but you can provide a different gesture recognizer, too. You can also handle the presentation of a TweaksViewController if you prefer to not use a TweakWindow . Tweaking values Now for the fun part ‚Äì shake your phone, and your tweaks appear! Adjust booleans with a switch, numbers with a stepper or keyboard, and there‚Äôs a great color-editing interface in there, too! There‚Äôs also a ‚Äúfloating UI‚Äù so you can edit tweaks without leaving a screen. Here‚Äôs a preview of the SwiftTweaks example app (included in the repository): Check it out on GitHub and let us know what you think! public struct ExampleTweaks: TweakLibraryType { \n    public static let colorTint = Tweak(‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúColors‚Äù, ‚ÄúTint‚Äù, UIColor.blueColor()) \n    public static let marginHorizontal = Tweak(‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúLayout‚Äù, ‚ÄúH. Margins‚Äù, defaultValue: 15, min: 0) \n    public static let marginVertical = Tweak(‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúLayout‚Äù, ‚ÄúV. Margins‚Äù, defaultValue: 10, min: 0) \n    public static let featureFlag = Tweak(‚ÄúFeature Flags‚Äù, ‚ÄúMain Screen‚Äù, ‚ÄúShow Body Text‚Äù, true)\n\n    public static let buttonAnimation = SpringAnimationTweakTemplate(\"Animation\", \"Button Animation\")  \n    public static let defaultStore: TweakStore = {     \n        let allTweaks: [TweakType] = [colorTint, marginHorizontal, marginVertical, featureFlag]      \n        \n        #if DEBUG         \n            let tweaksEnabled: Bool = true     \n        #else         \n            let tweaksEnabled: Bool = false     \n        #endif      \n        \n        return TweakStore(         \n            tweaks: allTweaks.map(AnyTweak.init),         \n            enabled: tweaksEnabled     \n        ) }() \n} // A \"multipleBind\" is called initially, and each time _any_ of the included tweaks change: \n let tweaksToWatch: [TweakType] = [ExampleTweaks.marginHorizontal, ExampleTweaks.marginVertical] \n ExampleTweaks.bindMultiple(tweaksToWatch) {     \n     let horizontal = ExampleTweaks.assign(ExampleTweaks.marginHorizontal)     \n     let vertical = ExampleTweaks.assign(ExampleTweaks.marginVertical)     \n     scrollView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: vertical, right: horizontal, bottom: vertical, left: horizontal) \n}", "date": "2016-05-09"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Starting Android at Khan Academy", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/starting-android-at-khan-academy/", "abstract": "By Ben Komalo The journey of a thousand miles‚Ä¶ In March, 2015‚Äîalmost 1 year ago to the day‚Äîwe started developing our first Android app at Khan Academy. A single step By then, Android was on version 5.0 Lollipop and nearing 1 billion active monthly users , representing around 8 out of every 10 phones worldwide. Our mission is to provide a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere, so we had to provide a great learning experience on this platform: Android reaches billions of users, many of whom rely on their phone as their only computing device. We launched version 1.0 of our app on the Play Store in August 2015, having learned a ton about Android development as a team. There‚Äôs plenty more ahead, but we thought now would be a good time to share a bit of our journey. Libraries and foundations Ironically, being late to the Android game came with its advantages. The platform had evolved significantly by early 2015, and we were able to target API level 16 and higher while still reaching 95{8f4f32d1c7b49be91940769544f9246738fa263bda282b485c2c255cc064ffb6} of users. Furthermore, the Support Library had provided fantastic new utilities like the RecyclerView and CoordinatorLayout , making modern Android ‚ÄúMaterial UI‚Äù significantly easier to build. The vibrant open-source community had also gifted us with plenty of useful libraries like Retrofit and Picasso , which we weren‚Äôt shy about adopting. Of course, good utility libraries are not enough: we knew we needed strong foundations throughout our code. We enforced separation of concerns right off the bat with two separate modules in our app: an Android-agnostic ‚Äúcore‚Äù module, and an ‚Äúapp‚Äù module for Android-specific application code: Our core module deals with tasks like fetching data, storing data, and transforming that data, while our app module reads that data, shows it to the user, and writes changes. Besides keeping our code clearer and more organized, this separation delivered a variety of secondary benefits. For instance, we can run our core module on a vanilla JVM without any Android runtime libraries or special mocking, making tests easier to write and also significantly faster to run ‚Äì fast enough that we can run them as a pre-commit check before sending out a change revision: 1290 tests in ~3s ‚ö°Ô∏è Those core tests can run on our CI server without having to deal with emulators, which have proven to be difficult to maintain. This has made us more confident in our tests, instilled a test-heavy culture in our development team, and allowed us to run more extensive end-to-end tests pretty easily. For example, one test tries to download and process our content library; we run this continuously to warn the content and server teams in case they accidentally change an API in a backwards-incompatible way. Modules add some complexity to the build setup, but the relatively small cost has been well worth paying. We‚Äôve since added a few more small modules, though the broader separation of ‚Äúcore‚Äù from ‚Äúapp‚Äù delivered the most benefit. In the future, as we consider cross-platform code sharing solutions, we may adapt the core module to be shared across our iOS and Android apps (more on that below). Tools In addition to having solid architectural foundations, we wanted to make the surrounding developer experience great. We had invested in various kinds of tools for our web app infrastructure, and we wanted to sharpen our tools on Android too. We‚Äôre still far from the ideal scenario: deploying and testing UI changes end-to-end still takes too long. But tools like Facebook‚Äôs Stetho provide a great debugging experience that can save lots of time once the app is on a device. All our network requests use OkHttp , and with the right configuration , Stetho can inspect them. We‚Äôve also created a custom DumperPlugin , which runs arbitrary commands in our app via the command line. Here we force our app to sync new content from the server: $ dumpapp ka-debug update-topic-tree Kicked off service to update topic tree For automating releases, we use Triple-T‚Äôs Gradle plugin to upload APKs to the Play Store. Our CI server publishes a new build from master every night to our alpha channel (internal employees). We use Git tags to track the version code; each build increments the number and makes a new tag (though we bump the marketing-oriented ‚Äúversion name‚Äù manually). We‚Äôre still building out lots of tooling to make things easier, including our still-nascent linting tools. If you‚Äôve got favorites to share, we‚Äôd love to chat. Many miles ahead Our team has learned a lot in the last year. Not only have we come a long way in building out our technical capabilities, but our fantastic design team has also adapted to thinking about new features in a holistic fashion; all three platforms (web, iOS and Android) are considered up front and designs are typically done simultaneously so the learning experience can make sense regardless of how you access it. That being said, we‚Äôre still a fairly small team, and re-building a feature three times is costly. We‚Äôre actively exploring possibilities for mobile code sharing strategies , but have yet to find a satisfactory solution. There‚Äôs also much to learn as a broader team about coordinating work across three platforms. Should we build features on one platform before starting work on the rest, for validation‚Äôs sake? How should we best enable our content creators to make compelling experiences that are flexible and can adapt to the learner‚Äôs device? Despite the challenges ahead, we‚Äôre excited to be building on Android. More importantly, we‚Äôre excited about the possibility of reaching vast numbers of learners through the platform. There‚Äôs a lot more we‚Äôre working on, like bringing the interactive exercises and other features learners have enjoyed on our website and in our iOS app to Android. We‚Äôre also thinking about ways to deliver our content in extremely limited connectivity environments, and other situations which can benefit from a native Android app. Excited about empowering learners using mobile technology?

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Our Transition to React Native", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/our-transition-to-react-native/", "abstract": "By Bryan Clark In 2017, Khan Academy started using React Native in our iOS and Android apps. As of this year 1 , we‚Äôve reached a big milestone: our transition to React Native is complete! Every screen in the app is rendered in React Native 2 . The initial experiment with React Native in 2017 was motivated by a few factors: The design of iOS and Android apps were nearly identical , with similar interaction-design, features, and content. Maintaining two codebases is challenging, with different data designs, bugs, and coordination for developing new features. (More on this in a minute.) Our mobile team is small 3 , so the transition didn‚Äôt require coordinating large numbers of engineers. Our website was already using React , so we had in-house expertise with the concepts and tools to help with the transition. Let‚Äôs talk a bit more about the challenges of maintaining two separate codebases: Different bugs would appear on different platforms. Of course this is the case with React Native, too, but it‚Äôs far less-common. Implementing a new feature required coordination of design, engineering, and testing across two platforms. That meant that you needed at least two engineers (iOS & Android), ideally available at the same time ‚Äì and for a team as small as ours, that was pretty hard to do! Once a feature was built, it was hard to change because you‚Äôd have to change it on both platforms. It was hard to adjust & update designs. Architectures varied a lot between the platforms. Our iOS codebase was four years older than our Android codebase. iOS had Swift, ReactiveCocoa, Cartography, and CoreData. Android had its own set of dependencies and data-flow designs. The differences here added up ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt often straightforward to borrow a feature from the other platform, and it wasn‚Äôt easy to review the other platform‚Äôs code, so our engineers were largely siloed by platform. Making the transition The transition essentially moved in three phases: Exploration, Straddling, and Extinction. (Basecamp‚Äôs Hill Chart is a great metaphor for this.) Exploration (early 2017) was early work to add bridges between native and Javascript code, with our very first screens in React Native, like the Search tab. Nearly all of the networking, data, business logic, and all that ‚Äúclient-side backend‚Äù stuff was passed over a bridge. This involved lots of boilerplate, so it was pretty tedious. Straddling (mid-2017 to mid-2018) was the hardest, for sure. We had decided to use React Native, but were far from the finish line. We now had three things to think about: native iOS, native Android, and the React Native code. Engineers needed to know two (or more) paradigms to make changes, and there was lots to learn! Extinction (mid-2018 to mid-2020) was my favorite part. This phase started with our ‚ÄúStreaming Topic Tree‚Äù project, a multi-month effort where we fully transitioned our content database (our many courses, videos, articles, and exercises) from a big bundled native database (e.g. CoreData) to a lightweight, caching library written in Javascript. Now that our client-side content database was in React Native, we didn‚Äôt need to pass nearly as much over the bridges we‚Äôd built, and could start deleting lots of native code. This year‚Äôs v7.0 release was the final push to upgrade our last native screen to React Native, while unifying the navigation design across phones and tablets. A mixture of native and React Native We use React Native for the ‚Äúcontents of a screen‚Äù, and native code for the navigation around those screens. There are a few underlying reasons, but it‚Äôs essentially a balance of ‚Äúwhere does the complex implementation live‚Äù vs ‚Äúwhat makes a native app feel native‚Äù. The vast majority of ‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù for our apps lives in the screen‚Äôs content (like the contents of our Home tab‚Äôs cards, or the downloading rules for our Bookmarks tab). By comparison, the contents of a tab bar or navigation bar don‚Äôt depend much on business logic. However, navigation bars and navigation controllers written in React Native feel fake in small ways that add up. A native navigation controller gives us the correct swipe-to-go-back gesture, as well as the correct animation timings for push/pop animations. A native navigation bar handles notched-iPhones with ease. Wrapping each screen in a native UIViewController also gives us familiar places in a screen‚Äôs lifecycle when needed. (There are libraries out there that have worked hard to mimic system-standard navigation bars; we‚Äôve not found one that meets our needs.) When we started that experiment in 2017, our rule was that the app had to still ‚Äúfeel‚Äù native. There are some places where it‚Äôs imperfect, for sure, but we feel confident that the compromises we‚Äôve made have allowed us to vastly improve our apps in many other ways! Internationalization & localization There are two pieces to translations for the mobile app: content and platform strings. Content strings come from our content management system; examples include questions in our interactive exercises, the contents and subtitles for a video, or the text in an article. (Many of these content strings are part of that ‚ÄúStreaming Topic Tree‚Äù I mentioned earlier.) Platform strings are defined in our mobile apps‚Äô codebase; examples include the text in a ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù button, a tab bar item‚Äôs title, or the text shown in our Settings screen. We‚Äôve got some excellent homemade infrastructure for maintaining platform strings. You define a string in JavaScript, and we‚Äôve built scripts that copy the string over to native iOS and Android strings. This has been quite helpful; we can easily reuse strings across native and React Native without issue, which greatly helped in that ‚Äústraddling‚Äù transition period. From 2015-2019, our app only supported six locales, but now we‚Äôre at nineteen! A shared iOS & Android implementation helped us get a streaming topic tree, which meant that adding additional languages wouldn‚Äôt bloat our app size. Additionally, we were able to design components in React Native that handle non-Latin characters with ease. Our mobile team is no longer the constraint on expanding our mobile apps‚Äô reach ‚Äî it‚Äôs whether we‚Äôve got enough of our (massive) content library translated to a particular locale. This has been a huge morale boost to our international advocates; they‚Äôre really excited to have a proper mobile app for communities around the world. How React Native feels This section‚Äôs a bit more of a personal-opinion, so uh, keep that in mind! Your mileage may vary. Moving to React Native hasn‚Äôt been perfectly rosy ‚Äî there have been bumps along the way, like learning a new language, a new component lifecycle, and more. The ‚Äústraddling‚Äù period was particularly challenging; there was a lot of tedious boilerplate code in bridging our native and React Native code! On a personal level, I miss a lot about Swift ‚Äì in particular, associated-value enums, convenience initializers, named parameters, and the ease of adding functions and vars to structs and classes. However, there have been a lot of perks to React Native! React Native has felt far more malleable than UIKit ; it feels great to shape and refactor code. The code you write for a UICollectionView is different than a UITableView is different than a UIStackView, for example ‚Äî but in React Native, you kinda just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt have to worry about it? For the most part, you can cut-and-paste code when refactoring, and it‚Äôs pretty trivial to change something from a grid to a list. (There‚Äôs a lot of overlap between this perk and many of the perks of SwiftUI.) Developer tooling is excellent. Xcode is where I came up as a developer, so I know its quirks, but my true love is now VSCode. It‚Äôs been a new vocabulary to learn, for sure ‚Äî but the fact that I‚Äôve got a VSCode plugin that autoformats my code when I hit save? Incredible! There are so many linters and auto-fixers that our code reviews really don‚Äôt involve many nitty styleguide fixes: the computer‚Äôs doing the formatting for us, and it just feels so helpful . I‚Äôm making an Android app, and I‚Äôm barely proficient in writing Android apps! I know enough to add an extra parameter or function, but I‚Äôm no architect on Android‚Ä¶ yet I‚Äôm able to reach our much-larger population of Android learners and build features for them! This is well in-line with our mission and my personal values, and it has felt so nice to be able to participate here. I feel more ready to participate in our web frontend. I‚Äôm a mobile developer at heart, but now that I‚Äôm familiar with React Native, it‚Äôs not much of a stretch to help out on our webapp, and a good portion of our mobile team is already doing exactly that! It feels great to branch out and explore web development (and we‚Äôve got web engineers contributing to our mobile codebase, too!). Where we are now Our iOS and Android apps share a single codebase, with engineers specializing in features of the app, rather than platform. This means we‚Äôre way better about improving the quality of a given feature over time, and we can make incremental improvements to features, rather than feeling like we need to get everything in the initial version. Shared infrastructure made it far easier for us to transition to GraphQL, which in turn is simplifying our server-side transition to Go . Our apps are significantly smaller. Switching from a big bundled content-library database to a streaming one dramatically reduced our app size. Yes, this could‚Äôve been done natively, but it was easier to implement this in a single place rather than coordinating it in two. We‚Äôre a far better dance partner with our website. During this transition, we took care to make our mobile designs resemble the information design of our website, which simplifies adding new cross-platform features like our new Mastery Challenge feature. Engineers have been able to bounce between web and mobile when they‚Äôre interested, which makes us feel closer with the organization as a whole. (If you‚Äôre a frontend engineer interested in Khan Academy, you‚Äôd be able to help build features across our mobile apps and the website!) We‚Äôve still got native code in the app, and that‚Äôs wonderful! When needed, we can hop back to Xcode or Android Studio and implement platform-specific features, like iPad multitasking. We‚Äôve got a robust design system , which helps our designers and engineers quickly put together improvements to our products. For mobile, this shows up in some key ways, like having standards and prebuilt components that handle touch-highlights, accessibility, loading states, and more. What‚Äôs next? The main engineering project at Khan Academy right now is Goliath , where we‚Äôre re-architecting our backend into a collection of Go services. Our unified mobile infrastructure has helped us in this transition: even though our mobile team is a half-dozen people, we‚Äôre still able to build new features and fixes! Our apps are in a far better place to improve and expand their capabilities, localizations, quality, and performance. One last caveat before finishing up here: Fully native apps are also terrific , and many of us still really enjoy working on them in our other projects. (Personally, my heart still belongs to Xcode, and I really enjoy thinking in Swift!) That said, our transition to React Native has been a huge boon to our team. It isn‚Äôt the One True Choice For Everyone, but it‚Äôs worked marvelously for us! Discuss on Hacker News Footnotes: What took us three years? We‚Äôve got a small team, and for the most part, only transitioned screens when we were working on them. Well, nearly-every screen. There‚Äôs a one-off Android language-selection screen that isn‚Äôt in React Native, and we don‚Äôt have a pressing need to migrate it to React Native, so it‚Äôs likely to stick around for a while! The mobile team size has varied over the years, but we generally have about a half-dozen mobile engineers.", "date": "2020-07-09"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "How wooden puzzles can destroy dev teams", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/how-wooden-puzzles-can-destroy-dev-teams/", "abstract": "By John Sullivan Last week a mysterious double-sided puzzle appeared at Khan Academy . To solve the puzzle you must fit all four pieces inside the recessed area (the pieces will not entirely fill the area). We found a solution to the easy side after only a few days 1 If you want to spoil it for yourself, here is a picture of the solved easy side . , but nobody could get close to solving the hard side. So five of us at Khan Academy began writing our own solvers. The first question we each faced was how to best represent the positions of the pieces. Laying a triangular grid over each side was intuitive enough, but it wasn‚Äôt obvious how the cells should be addressed. Naturally we all came up with different systems 2 Ben Eater decided to side-step the issue by drawing the shapes directly onto the screen. Cam Christensen came up with a coordinate system with two axes that formed a 60¬∞ angle and he convinced Emily Eisenberg to use the same system. Justin Helps used a vertex-based coordinate system (rather than piece-based) that made rotation and reflection easy, but collision detection super hard. . I went with a system that used two perpendicular axes, with the origin at the bottom left. I had a problem though. Once I manually input a piece into this coordinate system, I needed to rotate and reflect that piece into 12 different alignments. Reflection was easy, but despite my best efforts, I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to rotate the pieces programmatically once they were placed into my grid. After smashing my head against the problem for an hour and getting nowhere, I gave up 3 Emily, however, was able to easily figure out rotation and manually inputted the three rotations necessary for each piece (all the other alignments could be expressed as reflections of those rotations). Now I just had to write the logic to try every possible placement of the pieces, but I was behind. Ben Eater had already finished his solver and it was churning away. His solver didn‚Äôt do any pruning of the search space though (and took some time to check each placement), so he estimated that the solver would finish in around 2 years. I felt good about my chances of finding a solution before then. To try and be a little faster I added in some logic to skip large parts of the search space where possible. This worked by laying down a piece at a time, and only trying the other ones if there were no collisions. For example, first my program would lay down Piece A somewhere. If Piece A collided with a wall, my program would not try laying down Piece B yet, but would instead move Piece A somewhere else. This ended up working well and soon I had a solver that could brute force the puzzle in less than a minute. Emily Eisenberg finished her solver around the same time and we were able to confirm our results. The hard side of the puzzle was unsolvable . Clearly there was a very evil puzzle master in our ranks. Jamie Wong readily admitted to bringing in the puzzle, but despite the staggering proof to the contrary, he was adamant that a solution existed. He said our solvers all shared a fatal flaw. After a few hints, Emily and I did find the answer 4 You don‚Äôt really want me to give you the answer do you? That would be boring. . Which was good, because none of us had gotten any work done for awhile.", "date": "2015-07-06"},

When we added badges, and the badge summary page, it turned into the easiest way to measure progress because that information was so neatly summarized for users. It was never our intent to have badges be a primary motivator for the majority of users, but the lack of a profile was mildly distorting the experience for some users. While badges, stars, and points remain important, we wanted to make profiles a powerful metacognitive tool for students¬†in the same way that the knowledge map helps them understand the interconnectedness of the topics in Math. Don‚Äôt dumb it down Kids are smarter than we give them credit for. No one likes being patronized at any age, but all too often software patronizes students. Things like overly kid-like color schemes, oversized buttons, and over-simplified user interface are only really appropriate for *very* young children because they send a clear message to everyone about what you think of their level of intelligence/expertise. After spending several hours observing and interviewing 5th graders, I am happy to report that they are more¬†sophisticated and willing to experiment/explore than many adult users I‚Äôve worked with. The Focus graph shows how a student has divided their time on the site over the selected time period. This is a complex graph in some ways, but it also engenders some visceral reactions, like, is it simple looking or busy? A student/teacher might not at first glance notice that on the exercise ring we show a star next to any module name that you‚Äôve earned proficiency in, but when a user hovers the exercise the tooltip will explain what the star means. Our goal here was interesting at a glance but not necessarily completely obvious. The other important design decision on the graphs is that we didn‚Äôt use absolute scales anywhere. The result is that whether you spend 5 minutes or two hours on the site each day, the information remains visually interesting and useful. Make it cool We want students to start to identify themselves with the information that we‚Äôre showing in the profile. We want them to think it‚Äôs cool to have finished 80 math modules. As Ben has pointed out, grades are kind of boring in the grand scheme of things . Khan Academy profiles are designed to be visually compelling and highly interactive. Every chart provides tooltips and drill down capability (with back button functionality preserved). This gives a feeling of depth and allows students to explore/discover the connection between different metrics. And what‚Äôs cooler than success, right? It‚Äôs one of the most addictive feelings in the world. So many students struggle with the feeling of failure, and constant absolute measures like grades only exacerbate the problem. Not everyone is going to move at the same pace, and so we owe it to students to find meaningful and interesting progress indicators that include both absolute and relative measures. Profiles were¬†specifically¬†designed to provide measures that help students better understand their own educational progress, set goals for themselves, and measure themselves against those goals. The good news is that it really seems to be working . What do you think? In Ben‚Äôs original post on what you guys wanted to see in user profiles there were a ton of good discussions and ideas generated. Are you using profiles? If so, are they interesting to you? Missing something important? Are there things you like/dislike about the design itself (especially if you‚Äôve had trouble/confusion while trying to use profiles)?", "date": "2011-02-23"},

Since the early ‚Äò80s, schools have been stocking labs with the latest gadgets. Clearly, the world was changing. ¬†We‚Äôve seen the rise of personal computers, the internet, mobile devices, streaming video, social networking, and tablets. Our educational system must be able to benefit from these advances. However, most attempts have been fundamentally flawed. ¬†Computers were installed with mildly educational games that were kind of ‚Äúcute.‚Äù Teachers weren‚Äôt provided the right tools to properly integrate the technology into their day-to-day instruction. For the most part, we didn‚Äôt teach kids with the computer, we taught them how to use the computer. Most kids need no help and could probably teach their parents. In the end, computer labs were a side show, expensive investments largely squandered due to a lack of good content or purpose. We at the Khan Academy have a few thoughts on the right way to use technology in the classroom. ¬†The Khan Academy¬†is most known for the comprehensive video library that our founder Sal started creating in his spare time during his hedge fund days. However, thanks to recent funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Google, we have been busily building the software and tools we think teachers and students really need. Starting in November, we began a pilot in a few classrooms ¬†in Los Altos, California (fifth grade and seventh grade Math classes). ¬†Bill Gates‚Äô team recently sent a film crew down to document the work and has posted some great videos on his blog, The Gates Notes . The district itself has also created a blog where teachers, administrators, and students are posting their thoughts. Sal spoke at TED recently and talked about how we got started and where we are headed. What‚Äôs so different about our approach? ¬†For one, we are leveraging the computer for what it does best and leveraging the teachers for what they do best. ¬†We are ensuring students can truly work at their own pace on their own time. We are making sure students actually master concepts before they move on. We are empowering teachers with the real-time data they so badly need. ¬†We are allowing teachers to make much better use of classroom time, with more peer tutoring, project-based learning, and one-on-one coaching. ¬†Most importantly, we are making learning fun.", "date": "2011-03-20"},

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Bringing Creativity to Class Time (by Sal Khan)", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/bringing-creativity-to-class-time-by-sal-khan/", "abstract": "I recently gave a talk organized by Intel to computer science and engineering professors at some of the top universities in the country (including my own alma mater).¬† I was asked by one of the professors how I would use something like Khan Academy in the context of an engineering education.¬† I told him that I‚Äôd make projects the primary mode of learning (as opposed to something that just complements lectures and exercises).¬† Khan-like¬† lectures and problem sets would then be used as on-demand tools to facilitate the projects and free class and professor time from lecturing about core concepts.¬† Not only would it provide for deeper, more motivated learning, but a portfolio of meaningful projects is vastly more interesting for a prospective employer than a GPA on a transcript (we know because Khan Academy‚Äôs own hiring process cares a lot more about what someone has creatively produced than their GPA). ¬† I also added that this is how I think ALL education should be, not just engineering and not just higher education (projects can be anything from composing music to writing software). I explicitly remember working on a project my fourth year in college trying to relearn a good chunk of signal processing that I had first been exposed to in a class two years prior.¬† I wished that I had those lectures on-demand in granular chunks so that I could fill in my gaps.¬† I wished that I could have feedback on some exercises to make sure that I had the basics down solid enough to not do something disastrous in the image processing library I was writing.¬† I wished that I had the ability to interact with the professor that I knew two years prior only as a lecturer and that only knew me as a face in crowd.¬† Given this, wouldn‚Äôt it have been 10 times better if my focus during that signal processing class 2 years ago was this project?¬† Wouldn‚Äôt it have been even better if I had lectures and exercises on-demand when I was ready for them.¬† Wouldn‚Äôt it have been great if the professor‚Äôs time (and my peers‚Äô time) were liberated to advise and mentor me in my project instead of lecture?¬† Wouldn‚Äôt a solid piece of image processing software be a more impressive product of a signal processing class than an ‚ÄúA-‚Äù? Wouldn‚Äôt a portfolio of substantive and deep projects be more meaningful than a traditional transcript? There is¬† a reality that we live in a world of tests that, for better or for worse, society uses to measure the competence of students and sometimes teachers and schools.¬† These are used to filter people in and out of schools and careers and can dictate the direction of a student‚Äôs future.¬† Some of these do have some merit, but, because there are such high stakes involved, preparation for the skills deemed necessary for these exams crowd out creative activity during scarce class time.¬† To completely ignore this testing reality does a disservice to students, but to cater 100% to it would be equally damaging.¬† We think the Khan Academy offers a third way.¬† Namely, it can be used to allow the core skills develop at a student‚Äôs pace and only during a fraction of class time.¬† This liberates the rest of class time for peer tutoring, higher level interactions between teachers and students, and truly creative projects. I want to be clear how deeply rooted this is in our core philosophy.¬† I‚Äôve co-run two summer camps where the students did exactly this‚Äìthey spent 80-90% of their time building robots, experimenting with truly novel questions, and mentoring each other.¬† This was done in 2009 and 2010 before Khan Academy got its first funding and before I thought that this could be the focus of my life (I used the bulk of my vacation time from my day job at the time to run those camps).¬† The Khan Academy videos and software at the time (they were very primitive then) freed me from lecturing or administering problem sets and allowed me to dive deep into the students‚Äô projects (including their misconceptions on the core material).¬† this is what the camps looked like: Some of the other projects we did included: Having the students estimate the value of coins in a a large jar given any tool at their disposal (including sample coins, scales, rulers, spreadsheets).¬† We then took pictures and posted them on Mechanical Turk to see if the ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù estimate was better (we payed 0.01 per guess) even though their information was not as good.¬† This led to a fascinating discussion of information and noise and when crowd estimates could be better than experts. Six students played a variation of Risk called ‚ÄúParanoia‚Äù Risk where every player had the secret mission to eliminate one other player from the board (you only knew who you had to eliminate; you had to try to figure out who was charged with eliminating you). Once a player is eliminated, the winner is declared and the game is over.¬† All of the other non-playing students were each given $500 in monopoly money and a colored strip of paper representing each of the players on the board.¬† At the end of the game, a colored strip is worth 100 if that player won and 0 if they lost.¬† The students then traded slips as the game progressed.¬† Several students independently developed spreadsheet models based on the probabilities involved in the game.¬† Led to a deep discussion around information in markets and when bubble behavior develops (for example, several securities irrationally traded above 100) . We played a variation of freeze tag where we changed the size of the playing field and the number of ‚Äúfreezers‚Äù.¬† Students predicted and observed how the dynamics of the game changed as more freezers were added and the threshold needed to freeze everyone.¬† They were quick to draw analogies to other areas of science. From the energy, competence and creativity that I saw naturally coming from these students, it convinced me that this is how all school time should be. Perhaps the two most difficult aspects of fully transitioning to a project and exploration based model is the fixation on high-stakes tests and the energy and coordination needed for truly deep explorations (not cook-book pretend science/engineering).¬† We think the current incarnation of the Khan Academy can help the former (we are already seeing a dramatic transition to project-based learning in every Khan Academy formal pilot), but we are just in the top of the first inning (we got our office space 9 months ago).¬† Over time, we will include deeper simulations, modules and tools for deeper explorations.¬† We will also try to integrate suggestions for deep projects based on proficiency in core skills.¬† We are even considering starting a physical school here in Silicon Valley that would be a testing ground for the cutting edge in student exploration and creative activity.¬† Here is a direct quote from an email I sent to a potential supporter about how we envision this school: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have students focused on building, creating and exploring real-world projects‚Äì from composing original music to building robots, writing mobile applications or running truly novel experiments.¬† The Khan Academy software and videos would facilitate this by allowing many of the core skills to be developed independently and it would be a resource when the students hits a need to develop a core skill because of their projects (I now *need* to learn trigonometry and matrices to figure out how this graphical object in my mobile app will look when it is rotated).¬† As we fine tune the projects and explorations that work in this setting, we will attempt to integrate them more deeply into the core Khan Academy platform so students and teachers around the world have the infrastructure and tools to fully explore their creativity.‚Äù", "date": "2011-06-23"},

If you are already bored or haven‚Äôt run into any problems using Khan Academy, feel free to ignore. We had two primary goals for last night‚Äôs maintenance period: Fix the occasional ‚ÄúServer Error‚Äù pages that users have been seeing randomly. Fix some of the frustrating slowness users have been experiencing. These two problems are related, and we needed to swap out a large piece of our technical infrastructure* to properly address the root cause. Hence the need for our read-only period. Most of this transition went very smoothly. We put up an explanatory landing page that you may have seen, telling users, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äù Unfortunately, right when we were about to finish, we realized that we made a mistake with that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be back soon‚Äù page**. Due to this mistake, we were unable to get rid of that page and replace it with the fully functioning version of Khan Academy.

Some users may continue to see the ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be back soon‚Äù page long after we restored full functionality late last night.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Impact from using Khan Academy", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/impact-from-using-khan-academy/", "abstract": "by Shantanu Sinha We received an email a couple of months ago from a young man named Mark Halberstadt. ¬†In true Khan Academy style, he recorded a YouTube video for us to watch. His story is quite inspirational. ¬†Mark is a student who had given up on Math and Science and thought he was incapable of ever pursuing a career in a related field. ¬†He claims he was always a ‚ÄúC‚Äù student growing up and never had a channel to understand topics that interested him in engineering. ¬†He found the Khan Academy in 2007 and started watching videos on Trigonometry, Calculus, and even Arithmetic. ¬†He decided to go back to school last year to get a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering. ¬†He finished his first year in college with a 4.0 GPA for the entire year, including perfect scores on his Calculus and Chemistry final exams. ¬†He says, ‚Äúcoming from a background where my GPA graduating from high school was in the 2.0 range. ¬† That never would have happened ‚Äì getting a 4.0 GPA would never have happened without the help I got from the Khan Academy.‚Äù ¬†He goes on to say, ‚ÄúIt has helped me immensely. ¬†The impact for me in my life‚Ä¶I see it growing exponentially over the next 20 or 30 years.\" Students have always liked Khan Academy. ¬†The YouTube comments Sal received when he posted his first videos in 2006 are what motivated him to keep going (creating over 2400 as of today). ¬†However, it is still astonishing to see the impact our resources can have. ¬†Of course, while Mark is thanking us, he deserves 100% of the credit. ¬†He did all the work and took control of his own learning after the educational system left him behind. ¬†We just played a small role in enabling him. If there were only 1 student like Mark Halberstadt in the world, it would have been worth creating Khan Academy. ¬†The fact that this could so easily scale to millions is what makes Khan Academy special. Khan Academy seems to work well with supplemental learners like Mark, but how well does it work in schools? ¬†We have always believed that a great teacher can take our resources and push learning to new heights, by better focusing on the individual needs of each student. ¬† With the student mastering core skills on the computer, the teacher can leverage the classroom time for more engaging and dynamic activities such as project-based learning, peer tutoring, or lively discussion. Last school year, we started piloting our platform in a few schools in Los Altos, California. ¬†Our goal was to create better tools by directly observing how teachers and students interacted with our product. ¬† Los Altos was a fantastic partner, and our team built out many significant features based on their feedback (e.g., student knowledge map, teacher dashboards, badging infrastructure, new exercises). At the end of the school year, we all knew it was a success. ¬†Teachers could see a dramatic change in their students‚Äô excitement and enthusiasm towards Math. ¬†Students who traditionally struggled with the material were more confident and engaged. ¬†Other students were challenging themselves to levels we never thought possible. ¬†Common sense told everyone involved that we were on to something. We did not do a controlled research study. ¬†In part, because our organization was only 5 people for most of the school year, and we were just trying to build something worth researching. ¬†Things changed fast for us, and the system the students were using at the end of the school year was very different from the system they started using in November. However, we were curious to see how they did on traditional assessments like the end of year CST exam. ¬†It is not the ideal exam since it only tests performance on a narrow set of grade-level skills. ¬† Many of our students were remediating topics they should have learned years ago, or challenging themselves with much more advanced topics. ¬†None of these gains would be captured. ¬† However, the CST clearly matters, so it is worth understanding how our students performed. The initial results were quite promising. ¬†Our pilot included a couple of 7th grade classrooms with students who typically struggled in Math. ¬† ¬†We saw a significant improvement in this group. ¬†The number of Advanced or Proficient students increased dramatically, from 23% to 41% This was very heartening. ¬†Usually, the performance gap widens with students who struggle in Math, particularly when they get to more advanced topics like Pre-algebra. ¬†The fact that these students were closing the gap (non-pilot classrooms saw no significant change in their CST performance) was very promising. Our pilot also included a few 5th grade classrooms. ¬†Los Altos is a high performing district, and these students typically do very well on the CST. ¬†This year was no different, with 96% of the students in pilot classrooms scoring Advanced or Proficient. ¬† While these are great results, they are not statistically different from the non-pilot classrooms in the district. ¬† ¬†It turns out, in both pilot and non-pilot classrooms, the students were doing great on the exam and didn‚Äôt have much room for improvement. However, we could see amazing things happening with the 5th graders. ¬†A majority of students were attempting early Algebra, and many students were experimenting with Trigonometry and Calculus. ¬†These students were excited, engaged, and loved being challenged. ¬†Inadvertently, we highlighted a distinct but not often discussed problem with standardized, age-focused education. ¬† Students performing at high levels are often not sufficiently challenged. ¬†Teachers shouldn‚Äôt take kids who already know the material, and make sure they already know the material. ¬†Teachers should be pushing and challenging the students to their full abilities. ¬†Los Altos didn‚Äôt think everything was perfect because their students were scoring well on standardized exams; they saw significant value in creating an environment that was engaging and challenging for all students. Based on these experiences, Los Altos has now decided to expand the implementation district-wide to over 40 more classrooms. ¬†We are also working with a number of additional schools that represent different use cases (e.g., charter, independent, low-income, special needs) to understand how students react to our resources in these different settings. ¬†This year we will also look into a better evaluation methodology that reflects learning gains across multiple grade levels. We are completely convinced that our resources can have a huge impact on the learning process. ¬†But why exactly does Khan Academy work? ¬† Some people have a hard time understanding how online videos and practice exercises can make such a big difference. ¬†Or they misunderstand what Khan Academy is all about. Putting videos on YouTube is just a small piece of the equation. ¬† What Khan Academy enables is a fundamentally different way for students to approach learning. ¬† Here‚Äôs my take on the many innovations we are bundling together into a coherent experience. This is what is really making the difference. Students are free to learn anytime, anywhere Students can jump to where help is needed most, and spend as much time as necessary to master concepts The content is short, fun, approachable, and easily digestible There is a clear and continuous path to learning complex topics Students feel an increased sense of ownership ‚Äì they are learning, not \"being taught‚Äù The focus on core conceptual understanding ensures students build the necessary skills that are applicable in any curriculum used in schools Interactive practice ensures concepts truly sink in Rich data helps teachers monitor progress and provide focused support Teachers are empowered to make their classroom experiences much more fun, engaging, and social, with less lecturing and more project-based learning and peer tutoring We learned a lot this past year, and I suspect we will learn much more this coming school year. ¬† The results so far have been promising. ¬† However, in our view, we‚Äôre just getting started. ¬†We got office space and started building a team only 10 months ago. We still have a long way to go to reach our vision for technology-enabled education.", "date": "2011-09-15"},

ASE plans to run a few more pilots early next year in Ghana and South Africa and will continue to find new ways to work with the resources that they have available. It is amazing to hear about how these organizations (and more that we have not even heard about) are innovating to bring world-class education to their students ‚Äì especially in regions where getting basic education is a hurdle for many children. ¬†There‚Äôs a magic that happens when high quality content is available for free to the world, and it is exciting to see what happens when people are inspired to take action and change the world one step at a time.

We‚Äôve had to keep this hush-hush‚Ä¶but we can now announce that we have contributed more than 100 videos to the unbelievably great, second iteration of the Google Art Project : We‚Äôve made 90 Khan Academy videos expressly for version 2, which launched today, April 3rd, at the Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, the Art Institute of Chicago, and museums in many other countries. We‚Äôve also contributed 26 pre-existing videos to the Art Project. Finally, we worked closely with Sandbox Studios to create an engaging introduction to looking at art: Our videos can be seen in the education section (the playlist is embedded at the bottom of the first page) and on the specific object ‚Äúdetail‚Äù pages. We jumped at this opportunity because the Art Project has such enormous educational potential. It is critical to gather works of art from different institutions to tell the nuanced stories of art history. The Art Project brings together works of art from 151 museums in 40 countries within a cohesive visual environment. The high resolution images, powerful zoom function, ‚ÄúMuseum View‚Äù (an interior version of ‚ÄúStreet View‚Äù) and the ability to collect and annotate images, are all features that are ideal for teaching and learning. Museums of art safeguard, make accessible, and interpret our shared cultural history even as they help to define the civic aspirations of their communities. Museums have always been defined by place, although traveling exhibitions and, more recently, museum websites have helped to ‚Äújail break‚Äù the art.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Topic Badges For Great Justice!", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/topic-badges-for-great-justice/", "abstract": "Hi there, i‚Äôm marcos ojeda, a designer at Khan Academy. Let me tell you about Topic Badges. A while back, Ben and Jason started work on revamping our exercise framework to allow multiple exercises to be grouped under the umbrella of a Topic. Jason asked me if i‚Äôd be interested in making some badges for these new higher-level topics and i eagerly agreed. The task is pretty amazing when you first hear it: ‚Äúmake some icons that represent math topics like ‚Äòaddition and subtraction‚Äô or ‚Äòfunctions.‚Äô‚Äù I immediately turned to some of my favorite representational goto s, namely isotypes , Japanese Mon and Brian Eno . And naturally there‚Äôs a whole history of people trying to synthesize a concept into a single icon, so prehistoric cave painter, i tip my hat to you. Starting points For my attempt, i basically started doodling until a workable concept began to ossify. The standard i set for myself was something between the golden record whose goal was to be a sort of message in a bottle to far-off lifeforms. The cover, shown above, is a sort of puzzle-explanation which, when decoded, explain how to use a cartridge (included!), as well as showing the location of earth. All without words. An explanation of the record shows exactly how much information is embedded within it. Additionally, i took as inspiration the sorts of reference diagrams you tend to find in pre-war textbooks for example, this book cover shows a concise representation of the Munsell color system whose core units are hue, chroma and value. Additionally, i love the genre of ‚Äúthis coincidentally heraldic diagram represents everything about this course‚Äù that you tend to find in math and science classes, like this classic one which sneaks in a fixed point combinator alongside a supremely visual description of recursion: or this gem from the back of Strang‚Äôs linear algebra textbook whose true intention and significance only really makes sense towards the end of your first linear algebra course. The common thread between all of these is that the symbol itself is grokkable, you can get it as a thing, but its true meaning is somewhat opaque until you understand enough of the subject for the icon to represent the relevant salient details. Since we are in the business of helping folks learn concepts, it seemed right to have badges which became more interesting the more you learned. Topic badges As it happens, here‚Äôs what ended up happening for, addition and subtraction exercises (q.v. the addition and subtraction topic page ). Notice that it spans the gamut between visual puns representing addition and subtraction to literal visual representations of dots being grouped and so forth. For a topic like exponents (which isn‚Äôt yet available), you end up getting the more out of the box style treatments that begin to have that sense of mystery to them (some of them even making no direct connection to exponents at all. ) The not-so-obvious-to-me lesson here, is that sometimes trying to distill a topic will fail if the topic is too broadly specified. This is also, exactly why things like the noun project succeed at things like sasquatch but do less stellar with things like blog . Go back and take a look at the visual solutions for Addition and Subtraction, a topic that is incredibly broad, and contrast that with the sorts of visual treatment for Exponents. As a secondary check, i think, if it becomes difficult to distill a topic without resorting to using its dominant operators, then the topic is probably too broadly specified (maybe we should have an addition topic? or grouping? who knows!) All the badges The result of all this topic-level navel-gazing was, at present count, 45 separate badges (of which only 28 are currently deployed ): and at a glance, all the badges here: For each topic, there‚Äôs a regular badge and then there‚Äôs a completed badge which is rendered as a gloriously shiny button or token. Some technical details Despite the fact that this seems like a straightforward doodling project, there were some technical issues to deal with: the round badge shape was not predestined, for quite a while i assumed we would crop the square to a circle using css rounded corners as a lo-fi mask, but for various reasons it eventually made sense to actually generate circular images i am using illustrator‚Äôs artboards liberally illustrator files don‚Äôt play nicely with most code review systems or git/hg/whatever and make it difficult to get code reviews . Round files are a delicious curse Illustrator files (namely their artboards) are transparent. When exporting (or saving for web) you have the option to mark the artboard as transparent, which would make round pngs trivial, right? Lamentably, save for web is a sort of painful mouse-heavy rigamarole and if you‚Äôre trying to batch-export a bunch of badges at, say, a new size, i would rather not be on the hook for clicking over and over again. (would you?) To that end, i wrote a small script to control graphicsmagick with ghostscript to render illustrator files at arbitrary resolution. How? It turns out illustrator files are almost entirely pdf files but with extra information for storing illustrator metadata. Artboards are great!! Since CS4, artboards in Illustrator are the best feature . Remember how i mentioned that illustrator files are basically pdfs in hiding? You can leverage this in order to both save divergent copies of a given illustration in the same file and also to share this information with others. Artboards in illustrator are represented as pdf pages with their own dimensions, so this makes it trivial to share illustrator files once people know to open them with a pdf-compatible application and comment on a given page. This also means that the first illustrator rendering script can be amended to know about artboards and what they contain. So the file has evolved somewhat to include this functionality. There‚Äôs a json file which marks which artboards are for what purpose and somebody without illustrator could actually pull down the repo and generate badges if they felt like it. But what about code reviews? It‚Äôs no fun to do work but not get any good feedback. You can get stuck in a rut and it‚Äôs always good to have a separate pair of eyes, but unless you want to be a hovering art director , the process of providing crit for files which are clearly works in progress is a bit awkward. In order to get around this, I used the Mac FSEvents python library to watch over my project folder and commit the whole directory each time I hit save from within illustrator. The script which does this also lives in kiln and is called artboard.py . The result, though is that instead of obtuse commit messages, it provides some context of what changed from commit to commit. and more interestingly, since i can have the script render on each save as well, i can take advantage of kiln‚Äôs visual diff tools, so that i actually can get valuable feedback on a given changeset or just share some changes with anyone who‚Äôs interested. There are a bunch of small hacks between the different rendering scripts to improve edge rasterization with transparency (involving some absurd downsampling) and to create fast previews depending on what the image is for. The tangible result ends up being that it was possible to open up the design and production process to be both flexible and open. Final points! I know many people have reservations about using Illustrator for icon design when it gets rendered down to a tiny image. Fair enough, but also, there‚Äôs something to be said for balance benefit and cost. For now it‚Äôs an acceptable loss, but it would be nice if vector artwork could be hinted like typefaces are. In some ways, a consistent badge family shares lots of the same design properties a typeface does, so maybe type design is a better way to go about thinking about things like‚Ä¶ i did not obey whatever golden rule that says that the smallest stroke in an icon should be 1/20th the width of the icon‚Äôs bounding box, but i should have, because it would have made them all uniformly legible. It was a great process and I look forward to tuning, revising and creating new badges as we work to refine the size and design of our topics this summer. Thanks for making it this far!", "date": "2012-05-24"},

What is Tau, you ask? In 2001, Bob Palais published the article ‚ÄúœÄ Is Wrong‚Äù in which he argued that the beloved constant œÄ is the¬†wrong choice of circle constant. He instead proposed using an alternate¬†constant equal to 2œÄ, or 6.283‚Ä¶ to represent ‚Äú1 turn‚Äù, so that 90 degrees is¬†equal to ‚Äúa quarter turn‚Äù, rather than the seemingly arbitrary ‚Äúone-half œÄ‚Äù. Two years ago today, Michael Hartl published ‚ÄúThe Tau Manifesto‚Äù echoing¬†the good points made by Palais and building on them by calling this ‚Äú1 turn‚Äù constant œÑ (tau), as an alternative to œÄ.¬†Tau is defined as the ratio of a circle‚Äôs¬†circumference to its radius, not its diameter and is equal to 2œÄ. Tau is approximately equal to 6.28, so that makes today (6/28) tau day!¬†Aside from eating twice as much pie as we would on 3/14, we‚Äôve found another¬†way to recognize tau day: Thanks to Emily Eisenberg, one of our awesome summer interns,¬†all of our exercises that can be answered in terms of pi can now be answered¬†in terms of tau too!

Our engineers have put an emphasis this summer on improving moderator tools. We have taken on a few new volunteer ‚ÄòGuardians‚Äô who help us moderate discussions. They are helped out by our users who do a great job flagging low-quality posts. However, even with all this, the number of posts the Guardians have to sift through can be daunting. Drew and Kitt came up with a naive, but surprisingly effective, automatic way to detect low-quality questions and answers *before* they are posted. We call it our Robot Army. By standing on the shoulders of giants , we came up with several heuristics that can detect and prevent offensive and low-quality posts. We look for everything from abnormal uppercase-to-lowercase ratios to content with little substance. We also try to prevent users from asking for things like up-votes. Notifying the user of a low-quality post is a delicate manner. Rather than condemning the action, we take more of a glass half-full approach and prompt the user to clarify her question or answer before posting it. We‚Äôll even go as far as to given them contextual hints on how to improve it, whether it be ‚ÄòUse standard capitalization‚Äô or ‚ÄòTry to not repeat the ! character so many times.‚Äô At that point, the user may or may not choose to improve her post. If she goes with the latter, then her post will initially be hidden from the site. While the heuristics used in our low-quality detection are fairly conservative, there are undoubtedly going to be false positives. In this case, a Guardian will able to see the post in our ‚ÄòPending Approval‚Äô moderator queue and approve it, making the post appear to everybody. We hope that these changes will help improve the quality of discussion. As for you, our users: keep on asking great question, writing helpful answers, and flagging offensive posts!", "date": "2012-09-20"},

And so we set out to see if Khan Academy might be used as a catalyst for change.¬† But before I expound on the results of this experiment, I ought perhaps give a little more background on the environments we‚Äôre working in. Townships in South Africa are not unlike the favelas of Brazil or the slums bordering Delhi and Calcutta in India.¬† They are urban areas that were, until the end of Apartheid in 1994, reserved for non-whites, but have now become residential hubs for the urbanizing masses.¬† They are typically built on the periphery of cities and tend to be characterized by high population density, poverty and unemployment. ¬†Picture a ramshackle of makeshift houses constructed out of corrugated iron, wood scraps and cardboard, jigsawed together into a gigantic maze 5 miles wide and 10 miles across.¬† At the risk of generalising grossly, that‚Äôs more or less the picture I want you to have in mind as you read this article. Now, townships in South Africa get a bad rap.¬† They are viewed as ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô places and it is considered unwise to visit them unless you know someone there, or visit them as part of a ‚Äòtownship tour‚Äô.¬† Yet while crime rates in these areas are often high, the reputation does not do justice to the vibrant and persevering people who inhabit them.¬† In particular, townships are YOUNG! ¬†On any given day, around two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, the streets flood with uniformed, backpack-toting children on their way home from school.¬† And despite having barely two pennies to rub together, they are meticulously dressed ‚Äì shiny black shoes, starched white collars ‚Äì and have aspirations to match.¬† ¬†Most of the children in South Africa live in some form of township, which means that children growing up in these environments constitute the better part of the future of our country. And yet it is supremely difficult to convince our best teachers to go and work in these areas.¬† They are offered good jobs in well-resourced schools most often located in the wealthy suburbs of the cities.¬† Principals at these schools compete fiercely for their skills.¬† And this is as it should be.¬† But it also entrenches the educational bias whereby a child‚Äôs access to quality education is directly proportional to the wealth of their family (see chart below). * University exemption rate refers to the percentage of learners who attain the academic marks in their final year of school that are necessary to gain access to South African universities. So Numeric‚Äôs experiment was to see whether we could use Khan Academy, in conjunction with a slightly less skilled (and often unqualified) math coach, to create the high impact and stimulating learning environments enjoyed by kids living in wealthier suburbs. The opportunity provided by Khan Academy premised on the following:¬† Videos do not argue about where they are played; they are unaffected by crime and environment. Appropriately licensed, they do not cost anything.¬† They do not grow weary, skip class, or grow jaded.¬† Instead, they convey their message enthusiastically, faithfully, clearly ‚Äì time and time again.¬† A child may watch just as many videos as he/she has appetite for, and need never feel limited by the dragging on of a boring class or an inept teacher.¬† For many children in South Africa, a Khan Academy video will be their first exposure to what we might term ‚Äòworld class instruction‚Äô.¬† When complemented by the exercises on the Knowledge Map, Khan Academy becomes a powerful tool for turning the tide on numeracy in South Africa. So what were the results of the experiment?¬† Well, it‚Äôs probably too early to draw any major conclusions, but we do have a few figures we‚Äôd like to share.¬† We currently run 7 Khan Academy classes across 3 different hubs in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.¬† The first pilot group of 20 Grade 9s has just completed its first twelve months of Khan Academy and their numbers are as follows: * Total Khan Academy hours delivered:¬† 2220 * Total Problems Solved:¬† 27,988 * Total Problems per learner:¬† 1399 * Total Khan Modules Complete:¬† 1232 * Average Modules per learner:¬† 62 Bearing in mind this is an afterschool programme, these are 27,988 math problems that would not otherwise have been attempted.¬† The 62 modules completed by the average learner constitute 62 gaps that those learners have filled.¬†¬† But it‚Äôs more about just the numbers; it‚Äôs about creating excitement and enthusiasm around learning.¬† This is hard to convey in words, but perhaps a picture will suffice. As we always say to our coaches, the tragedy in South Africa is not so much that kids don‚Äôt want to learn.¬† It‚Äôs that some kids DO want to learn, but can‚Äôt.¬† Khan Academy provides us one way to give these kids a world-class education without having to magically replenish our nation‚Äôs supply of teachers.¬† And who knows, perhaps one day these kids will become the inspirational and talented teachers we have waited for for so long! ‚Äî Andrew Einhorn is the founder and current CEO of Numeric.org.

But along the way, we learned a lot about how we might use the web to think about teaching art history.¬†We opened our classrooms, and opened Smarthistory to art historians, hoping in the process that together we could create a free, open resource for the teaching and learning of our discipline. We learned we could teach‚Ä¶ 1) ¬†more experientially (why not make videos from audios recorded INSIDE the Arena Chapel or the Contarelli Chapel?) 2) more personally than the impersonal voice of the textbook 3) using lots more images than were ever available to us in the slide library (Flickr!) ¬†and tourist videos too (why not show students what‚Äôs it like to climb to the top of the Brunelleschi‚Äôs dome?) Today, Smarthistory.khanacademy.org has 250 essays and 500 videos (and all our videos and a few text pages are also on khanacademy.org). And this afternoon we were honored to read a blog post by our Contributing Editor for American Art, Dr. Bryan Zygmont, on how rewarding it has been to contribute to Smarthistory at Khan Academy (Bryan has contributed fabulous posts on Frederic Edwin Church , Leutze‚Äôs Washington Crossing the Delaware , and Benjamin West‚Äôs Death of General Wolf . Bryan‚Äôs post is titled ‚ÄúIn Praise of Smarthistory. ‚Äù So we want to take this opportunity to thank Bryan, and our other generous contributing editors, Dr. Nancy Ross, Dr. Rebecca Easby, Dr. Amy Calvert, Dr. Elizabeth Macaulay-Lewis. Email us if you‚Äôre an art historian interested in contributing. From Bryan‚Äôs post: SmartHistory.khanacademy.org is a peer-reviewed online art historial textbook. ¬†That is free. Free. ¬†For you, me, and for our students. ¬†Free, indeed, for the world. ¬†It‚Äôs like an art history Wikipedia, with one notable difference: those who write for it have something we like to call ethos. ¬†It‚Äôs written by art historians. ¬†But not just art historians. ¬†It‚Äôs written by art historians who have a sincere desire in teaching and pedagogy. ¬†It‚Äôs a wonderfully useful site. ¬†It currently contains almost 500 high-quality videos and nearly 250 essays. ¬†And by the time you read this, it‚Äôs likely to have grown (I‚Äôm just too lazy to update these number weekly!). What does this mean for the teacher of, say, Survey of Western Art II (Renaissance to Modern Art)? ¬†It means, quite simply, that you can have your students read the 500 words that may appear in Gardner‚Äôs Art Through the Ages on Giotto‚Äôs Arena Chapel. ¬†Or, you can send them to SmartHistory and have them watch a video (or four!) on the same work of art. Want some proof: ¬†Check out Part I of the video here. There is absolutely no way that the images or text of any book can match the detail and¬†enthusiasm¬†present in this video. ¬†And it‚Äôs one video of four that are available for the Arena Chapel. ¬†Quite simply, as this resource grows I believe it will fundamentally change the ways in which I teach art history. ¬†And change it for the better. It may seem hyperbolic to read such lines, but the are true: I am honored beyond measure just to be involved with this project in the small ways in which I am. ¬†It sincerely signifies the best part of my job of being a professor of art history.

Our kick-off meeting with all of the video-makers was this morning at 7am.¬† Folks trickled in over 15 minutes and the group was generally quiet, since they were still strangers to one another.¬†¬† We began with simple introductions (name, home institution, etc‚Ä¶). Pat, medical student, Columbia Shreena, CAM student, Georgetown Will, teacher, Teach for America ‚Ä¶ As we went around the circle, body language started to change and smiles started to emerge.¬† Everyone relaxed and we took our first step towards getting to know each other.¬† I went through the project background, our collaboration with the AAMC and RWJF, and our plans going forward.¬† We discussed goals and expectations for the week, as well as some basics tips/tricks for making compelling videos.¬† People seemed comfortable with the plan for the day, which was primarily to prepare 1-2 new videos. I planned to meet with everyone individually for 30 minutes, so that meant ~7 hours of 1-on-1 meetings.¬† The first one was with Pat, and it rolled on from there‚Ä¶¬† Over the course of the day, I had all sorts of interesting conversations.¬† Topics ranged from outlining goals for the week, to philosophical conversations about the role of Khan Academy in the education space.¬† However, the most interesting thing was what I noticed happening outside of my 1-on-1‚Äôs.¬† All of a sudden books and reference materials were being shared, dropbox folders being set up, and discussions about video editing were happening organically.¬† Through encounters in the hallway and on HipChat, these inspired video-makers were rapidly helping each other improve. The highlight of the day was lunch.¬† Each person had a partner with whom they had to give and receive feedback on their most recent videos.¬† The vibe was amazing!¬† They were giving one another the most incredible, detailed, and thought-provoking feedback.¬† Was the pace too slow and going to cause the viewer to ‚Äúget bored and fade away‚Äù or was it too fast and at risk for ‚Äúcreating good entertainment, but not necessarily good education?‚Äù¬† Was the scope going ‚Äútoo shallow and not really addressing the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô question‚Äù or was it too deep and getting ‚Äúlost in the weeds?‚Äù¬† For two hours there was a healthy exchange.¬† The ideas ran deep and the video-makers were looking to do something much more profound then simply put together a set of facts ‚Äì they wanted to create an optimal learning experience.¬† To have a passionate teacher is terrific, to have over a dozen of them bubbling with enthusiasm and ideas was a phenomenon!

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Edsurge article: Are teachers at the table or on the menu?", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/edsurge-article-are-teachers-at-the-table-or-on/", "abstract": "Edsurge writer Christina Quattrocchi shares with readers about the impact of Khan Academy‚Äôs teacher trainings that are happening across the country this summer. Are teachers at the table or on the menu? No company would dispute the value of teacher perspectives. However, often times it seems teachers become specimens to be studied, rather than vital partners. Yet, giving teachers time, training, and building trust are vital steps to ensuring products gets used and used effectively. This week, Khan Academy showed the industry one way to bring teachers to the table by hosting its own free teacher trainings in Redwood City . As the first of many around the country, the workshop hoped to teach math teachers about the nuances behind each of Khan‚Äôs education tools and offer different ways to implement them. By the end of the day, teachers were charged with developing a ‚Äúframe of mind‚Äù around what Khan could do for students. The full day of training took place at the Sobratto Center for Nonprofits in affluent¬†Redwood Shores, CA, where over 100 teachers filled the room. Coming from far and wide The event attracted teachers from cities near and far, from charter, public and private schools in Sacramento and Santa Cruz to those Grand Rapids, MI. Some came for at the behest of their supervisors, others by way of parent recommendations, but most teachers were there because they‚Äôd tried Khan before but wanted to dig deeper into how they could more fully implement it in their classrooms. Typically, teachers only get training for products that their schools have paid for. So they appreciated that Khan Academy put on this session without a price tag. One teacher explained, ‚Äúthis is certainly one of the only places I‚Äôve seen where something is completely free.‚Äù Start simple. Just start. Maureen Suhendra, who leads Professional Development for teachers at Khan Academy, began the day by emphasizing that Khan Academy‚Äôs role is not to offer prescriptions about how to use the program. ‚ÄúToday is not about giving you a scripted curriculum. There is no right way to do this.‚Äù She continually reinforced the importance for teachers to staying flexible and open-minded as they explore for themselves how Khan can best be implemented in the classroom. Teachers then split into groups, spending the first half of the morning digging deeper into coaching tools, with a self-guided tour through Khan‚Äôs world of data. Khan developers were on hand to answer questions and break things down for teachers when they got stuck. Teachers spent the rest of the day consulting experts, exploring case studies, and planning out their own implementation models. Teachers in Residence at Khan Academy, Tal Sztainer and Suney Park, were also on hand to share their personal stories and experiences of implementing the tools in their own classrooms. Park, a 15 year veteran teacher, was initially scared by the prospect of fully integrating Khan into her classroom. Dipping her foot into the Khan Academy waters, she began by integrating the videos and exercises one unit at a time. However, the persistent need for even more differentiation led Park to creating playlists of exercises ahead of time so that students could dip in and out of practicing different skills as they pleased, regardless of the unit the class was on. Park will continue to integrate Khan Academy next year, retaining the aspects of differentiation her students have enjoyed. However, she hopes to add more depth to each unit with real life application projects, an area Khan Academy has been historically deficient in. On what she‚Äôs learned from her experience using the tools, Park says ‚Äúthere is a fluidity that I didn‚Äôt expect to be possible‚Ä¶ I thought that learning the content was very linear, but these connections [between concepts] can be made and they can hold multiple pieces of information at one time when it comes to math.‚Äù Important ingredients As Khan Academy wrapped up its first workshops this week in Redwood Shores, the organization looks forward to the next stop on it‚Äôs PD tour: Chicago. As they move forward it‚Äôs clear there are a few crucial ingredients to bring teachers to the table. First, make it about more than a product. What Khan Academy did so well this week was convince teachers they care, starting with offering the workshop for free. They continued to demonstrate this as they discussed mission and vision throughout the workshop. They also make it clear that the training was about helping teachers to find ways to help their kids, rather than forcing a preconceived implementation plan on them. The second ingredient in bringing teachers to the table was to show that they ‚Äúget‚Äù what it‚Äôs like to be a teacher on a very deep level. From the beginning they explained that they get that kids will throw curveballs to initial implementation plans and that the final picture rarely looks like what teachers may originally have in mind. They also seemed to understand the emotional side of teaching. Park explained, ‚ÄúEvery teacher knows they can‚Äôt reach every kid and there is this guilt that results. Khan Academy addresses that discomfort that teachers feel and gives some ideas on how to make it better.‚Äù For the full article, visit https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-07-17-are-teachers-at-the-table-or-on-the-menu", "date": "2013-07-18"},

To think that such a goofy, silly, eclectic assortment of personalities could work together to pull off something as amazing as teaching MCAT content puts a smile on my face.¬† Only a family of teachers could do something so cool. Each and every one of them worked hard from morning to night, going through rounds and rounds of research, video production, and feedback.¬† They met daily to give each other constructive feedback, and went through multiple versions of each video trying to make it as clear, smooth, engaging, authentic, well-paced, and intuitive as possible. Going forward, one thing that I think that we can all say with confidence is that we learned something about the learning process, and how we can be more effective in making videos and writing questions.¬†¬† This process started out focused on the 2015 MCAT but it has developed into so much more‚Ä¶", "date": "2013-07-21"},

Kilimanjaro Christian Medical College has been using video based education for over a year.¬† They have their medical students watch videos made by their professors before coming to class.¬† To make sure that they are actually watching the videos, there is a short 10 minute quiz at the beginning of class that each student takes alone.¬† This forces each student to come to class prepared to discuss the material.¬† After submitting the quiz, students take a second quiz with the same questions within small groups.¬† This encourages them to discuss their answers and debate any differences of opinion.¬† Finally, they spend the remainder of class time discussing a clinical scenario.¬† Parts of this strategy could be used across disciplines, parts may be improved, but ultimately it‚Äôs the willingness to experiment and to push the boundaries of teaching that impresses me most.¬† Students really enjoy the system, and test scores are on the rise when compared to previous years.

This has two great effects: the person thanking acknowledges that they need others, and the person being thanked feels significant and valuable to the classroom community. How do I do it? Two simple initiatives: 1. At the end of every math session I dedicate about five minutes to Thank Yous, and students rush to put their hands up to give props to their helpful classmates. 2. Once a month my students are randomly paired with one another for a weekend letter-writing homework assignment. In the letters, they thank, appreciate, and compliment one another; sometimes the letters include creative touches such as drawings, stickers, and little snacks! Once I started doing this, giving thanks and verbally expressing appreciation became a regular part of my classroom culture. Now, my students feel safe enough to ask for help and confident enough to offer it. I was only able to implement my Khan Academy ‚ÄúNeed Help/Can Help‚Äù board during math class because of this foundation of classroom culture. Plus, it warms a teacher‚Äôs heart to hear students thank and encourage each other so effortlessly and sincerely.

We‚Äôre keeping them busy this week with a packed schedule. We began the training camp Monday at 7:00am and started out with some communication games and activities. After breakfast and a short online meeting with Karen Kesten from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, the winners spent a few hours discussing video editing and NCLEX-RN style question writing best practices. For videos, we broke down the qualities of a good video into 6 fundamental pillars: Content objectivity and accuracy, voice presentation, visual presentation, audience engagement, video pacing, and technical clarity/issues. Next we analyzed video clips! We chose some from Bill Nye The Science Guy episodes and selected some from existing Khan Academy videos to tease out what works well. Seeing a great teacher break down a complex concept into easy to understand explanations, is a thing of beauty. This was a lot of fun and prompted great discussion. After a quick break we made ourselves lunch and broke up into two groups where the winners gave one another feedback on the videos they had created themselves. It was so great to see everyone working together and providing such great constructive criticism and ideas. For example one person thought that it would be useful to draw the heart on its side to get a better view of the blood vessels coming off of it. Another person wanted to get ideas for a helpful analogy to explain the coagulation cascade. In terms of feedback, the most common concerns were related to presentation style ‚Äì an area that we will be focusing on over the week. After lunch everyone worked on their videos and questions, trying to incorporate the feedback they had received. Rishi and I met with the winners individually to give feedback on the videos, and questions, and then we finally finished off the night with Thai takeout and casual conversation. It was a busy first day, and a prelude to the week ahead. The neat thing is that you can already see the creative juices flowing, and the friendships beginning to build.

Over the past two school years, we collaborated with a number of schools and with SRI International to study various types of classroom use and the effects of different implementation approaches on teaching and learning. We‚Äôre excited to see the results of SRI International‚Äôs study for the school years 2011-2013, which was published today. While we recognize that we are still in the very early days of this journey, we‚Äôre really encouraged by some of the key findings: ‚Äì Positive association between Khan Academy use and some important outcomes: ‚Äì¬† Improvements in student test scores ‚Äì¬† Improvements in several non-cognitive measures such as students‚Äô math anxiety and belief in their ability to succeed academically ‚Äì¬† Teachers reported that integrating Khan Academy into their instruction increased their ability to support their students in a number of areas ‚Äì Students‚Äô perceptions of Khan Academy were very positive, and their engagement during Khan Academy sessions was high ‚Äì Students felt that using Khan Academy encouraged greater independence in learning This also reinforces a lot of what we hear from our users. Another big goal of our work with SRI and the schools in the study was to understand how we could improve the learning experience for our users. Our close collaboration with schools has been a major driver for many substantial and important changes to Khan Academy, including the personalized dashboard , grade-level missions and tutorials , more comprehensive Math content, and coach reporting . We‚Äôre grateful to have had the opportunity to collaborate with SRI and our partner schools on this project as we innovate and improve to help our millions of learners all over the world!

Today we‚Äôre adding 26 health conditions and 158 practice questions to our growing collection of health and medicine material. The new content covers diseases from the cardiovascular, respiratory, and hematologic systems, such as non-cyanotic heart diseases , lung cancer , and leukemia . Health science students can use this material as a supplement to their classes, and patients and their families can learn more about medical conditions relevant to them. Over the coming months we‚Äôll continue to frequently release new content, so be sure to keep checking Khan Academy! Right now¬†we‚Äôre¬†looking for volunteers to help us write NCLEX-RN style¬†questions. If¬†you‚Äôd¬†like to help us with this exciting project, send us an¬†email .

Unfortunately, we are not. However, we have learned so much from those camps that we are now exploring a longer duration, but smaller scale, learning lab in the coming months. This will be set up to let us have an even more hands-on and sustained approach to research blended learning and education innovation, which will also let us experiment and share our learnings with schools and networks around the world. This is just one of the many ways we‚Äôre learning from educators and students: we connect with hundreds of thousands of folks who use Khan Academy in their classrooms, we run pilots with numerous schools including Idaho State and of course facilitate our teacher workshops. These avenues help us understand so much more about creative ways to teach, and also help make our platform even more useful for learners everywhere. Stay tuned: we‚Äôll post more updates in the coming months, and we look forward to sharing what we learn soon ‚Äì sign up here if you‚Äôd like to hear more about it. In the meantime, to beat the summer slump, come check out our math missions from early math through calculus!

The idea was to combine the power of Khan Academy with the network of the Aspen Institute, an educational and policy studies organization, to bring the ideas and perspectives of some of the most respected authorities on various subjects to learners anywhere, for free. Over the past several months, Khan Academy and the Aspen Institute have been working in partnership to develop a new and exciting series on the American Revolution. Just last week, we launched that series which includes tutorials on the founding documents , founding fathers , and founding mothers of the United States of America. This initial offering of videos lives up to the idea of bringing together respected authorities on the subject, and the videos feature conversations between Sir Walter Isaacson and a variety of phenomenal contributors including Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Joe Ellis, award-winning journalist Cokie Roberts, and our very own Sal Khan. Rather than offering simplified answers or shying away from unanswered questions, this first series of videos introduces learners to the complexities of the revolutionary era. They use the stories of the prominent individuals and revolutionary documents of the day to draw learners deeper into the history. Beyond the dates, names, and battles, the story of the founding comes alive and beckons the curious to investigate further. These tutorials on the American Revolution are a great starting point and we look forward to exploring other areas with the Aspen Institute in the future. More to come soon! Check out this and other partner content available today on Khan Academy . Start here", "date": "2014-06-30"},

The 2015 MCAT is different from the previous MCAT exam because it will include new content in areas like psychology and sociology. To help students get ready for this new exam, Khan Academy has partnered up with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Association of American Medical Colleges, and so far we have put together a collection of 500 videos and 600 practice MCAT questions . The competitions were a tremendous success and we found 12 video competition winners and 20 question and article writing competition winners. We asked all of them why they decided to participate in the competition. Meet our winners and see what they had to say: MCAT Video competition winners: Efrat Bruck Columbia University Medical Center Khan Academy has always been an invaluable resource for me.

At the time KA Lite was launched, 65% of the world did not have Internet access. In the intervening 18 months, Internet penetration has increased a mere few percent, while KA Lite usage around the world has blossomed, supported by the KA Lite team that banded together to form the non-profit organization Learning Equality . KA Lite has now been installed in over 120 countries, in contexts as varied as low-income schools in India, orphanages in Cameroon, prisons across the United States, and First Nations community centers in northern Canada.

Click here to read it alongside other conversations with Sal. <!‚Äì By: Salman Khan Join the¬†#YouCanLearnAnything¬†movement My 5-year-¬≠old son has just started reading. Every night, we lie on his bed and he reads a short book to me. Inevitably, he‚Äôll hit a word that he has trouble with: last night the word was ‚Äúgratefully.‚Äù He eventually got it after a fairly painful minute. He then said, ‚ÄúDad, aren‚Äôt you glad how I struggled with that word? I think I could feel my brain growing.‚Äù I smiled: my son was now verbalizing the tell¬≠-tale signs of a ‚Äúgrowth¬≠ mindset.‚Äù But this wasn‚Äôt by accident. Recently, I put into practice research I had been reading about for the past few years: I decided to praise my son not when he succeeded at things he was already good at, but when he persevered with things that he found difficult. I stressed to him that by struggling, your brain grows. Between the deep body of research on the field of learning mindsets and this personal experience with my son, I am more convinced than ever that mindsets toward learning could matter more than anything else we teach. Researchers have known for some time that the brain is like a muscle; that the more you use it, the more it grows. They‚Äôve found that neural connections form and deepen most when we make mistakes doing difficult tasks rather than repeatedly having success with easy ones. What this means is that our intelligence is not fixed, and the best way that we can grow our intelligence is to embrace tasks where we might struggle and fail. However, not everyone realizes this. Dr. Carol Dweck of Stanford University has been studying people‚Äôs mindsets towards learning for decades. She has found that most people adhere to one of two mindsets: fixed or growth. Fixed mindsets mistakenly believe that people are either smart or not, that intelligence is fixed by genes. People with growth mindsets correctly believe that capability and intelligence can be grown through effort, struggle and failure. Dweck found that those with a fixed mindset tended to focus their effort on tasks where they had a high likelihood of success and avoided tasks where they may have had to struggle, which limited their learning. People with a growth mindset, however, embraced challenges, and understood that tenacity and effort could change their learning outcomes. As you can imagine, this correlated with the latter group more actively pushing themselves and growing intellectually. The good news is that mindsets can be taught; they‚Äôre malleable. What‚Äôs really fascinating is that Dweck and others have developed techniques that they call ‚Äúgrowth mindset interventions,‚Äù which have shown that even small changes in communication or seemingly innocuous comments can have fairly long¬≠-lasting implications for a person‚Äôs mindset. For instance, praising someone‚Äôs process (‚ÄúI really like how you struggled with that problem‚Äù) versus praising an innate trait or talent (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so clever!‚Äù) is one way to reinforce a growth ¬≠mindset with someone. Process¬≠ praise acknowledges the effort; talent¬≠ praise reinforces the notion that one only succeeds (or doesn‚Äôt) based on a fixed trait. And we‚Äôve seen this on Khan Academy as well: students are spending more time learning on Khan Academy after being exposed to messages that praise their tenacity and grit and that underscore that the brain is like a muscle. The Internet is a dream for someone with a growth mindset.¬†Between Khan Academy, MOOCs, and others, there is unprecedented access to endless content to help you grow your mind. However, society isn‚Äôt going to fully take advantage of this without growth mindsets being more prevalent. So what if we actively tried to change that? What if we began using whatever means are at our disposal to start performing growth mindset interventions on everyone we cared about? This is much bigger than Khan Academy or algebra ‚Äì it applies to how you communicate with your children, how you manage your team at work, how you learn a new language or instrument. If society as a whole begins to embrace the struggle of learning, there is no end to what that could mean for global human potential. And now here‚Äôs a surprise for you. By reading this article itself, you‚Äôve just undergone the first half of a growth¬≠-mindset intervention. The research shows that just being exposed to the research itself (¬≠¬≠for example, knowing that the brain grows most by getting questions wrong, not right¬≠¬≠) can begin to change a person‚Äôs mindset. The second half of the intervention is for you to communicate the research with others. We‚Äôve made a video (above) that celebrates the struggle of learning that will help you do this. After all, when my son, or for that matter, anyone else asks me about learning, I only want them to know one thing. As long as they embrace struggle and mistakes, they can learn anything. ‚Äì You can view the original op-ed in Huffington Post here . ‚Äì>", "date": "2014-08-19"},

You can access our content all in French whether you‚Äôre from Paris or Port-au-Prince. ¬†Just visit fr.khanacademy.org to start learning in French. We thought it would be fun to show you some of the team of dedicated translators who helped make this possible. Merci to one and all and thanks for your hard work and enthusiasm in making this happen! Mathieu Bardeau After a Master‚Äôs degree in management at Edhec Business School, I put into practice what I had been taught, and joined the media industry. Working with the Khan Academy is great because it combines my skills in addition, subtraction, and even multiplication, with my passion for telling stories. Thomas Blasselle I am a math addict! I taught math after college, and eventually became a school book editor specializing in various sciences subjects. Khan Academy‚Äôs math look more like what I believe maths should be: a living matter made of reflection and research. Pierre Bondareff I am a physics and chemistry teacher and recently also got my PhD in physics. When I heard about Khan Academy, I was immediately very enthusiastic to participate in this modern adventure. I like teaching to others and Khan Academy allows me to do it in a very direct way. Wherever you are, with a well-working education system or not, an internet connection will be enough to connect yourself on the website and to learn at your pace. Bastien Bruneau I specialized in renewable energy at Ecole Polytechnique, where I am still working for my PhD on plasmas and photovoltaic research. I strongly believe that the Khan Academy brings something new and innovative to the way knowledge is passed on. Romain Cariou I am at the beginning of the end of my thesis on material science and photovoltaic cells, at the Ecole Polytechnique. When I was a student, YouTube was more full of videos of cats and babies, rather than Newton‚Äôs Laws, Matrix or Stereochemistry. The democratic way of sharing knowledge with Khan Academy‚Äôs approach of is a great initiative; all you need is internet and a little curiosity to benefit from it. Eloa Chosson I‚Äôve always been captivated by mathematics. After I graduated from the Toulouse School of Economics, I went to Australia and ended up training horses on remote stations where most children are taught by their parents through a homeschooling system. I thus got a grasp of the importance of distance education and this is why I decided to get involved in the Khan Academy project. I now enjoy translating Sal‚Äôs videos because of his innovative approach and his way of making maths concepts easy to understand and remember. Isabelle Dautriche I am a PhD student at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure, working on language acquisition (how do infants acquire their native language?) Making some videos for Khan Academy is a great combination with my PhD because when my research gets stuck, I can do a 10min video which will be useful for kids, teenagers and adults. Perhaps this is actually the most useful job that I‚Äôll ever have! Yassine El Ouarzazi I grew up in Casablanca, Morocco, and moved to France when I was 17 to go to engineering school. ¬†I have a passion for science and education, and I immediately fell in love with Khan Academy after watching Salman Khan‚Äôs TED talk . I hope this project will help my two kids and millions of other ones in my continent of origin, Africa, to have access to ‚Äúa free world-class education for anyone anywhere‚Äù. Ram√Øn Farhangi After getting an Engineering degree from Cornell University and Ecole Centrale Paris, I now live my passion as a Math/Physics teacher in Madrid. I joined the Khan Academy team in France because it‚Äôs fun to make videos, it improves my teaching skills, and because I help providing the world (and notably developing countries) with high quality lessons.Working for Khan Academy has indeed given my life more meaning! Lydie Morel I graduated from a PhD of Neuroscience and spent four years in Boston where I learned English and discovered Salman Khan and his work with the Khan Academy. When I got the lucky opportunity to join the Biblioth√®que sans Fronti√®res‚Äô team of translators, I grabbed it! As a kid, I used to play with math exercises in my free time: I always tried to help my schoolmates see the elegant, logic and fun aspects of mathematics. Muy-Cheng Peich I am currently almost at the end of a PhD in social cognition which focuses on social interaction deficits in neurodegenerative diseases. I have always loved helping others understand things that fascinated me or things that I had found challenging to learn. I strongly believe in the use of technologies to reduce social inequality in education- that‚Äôs one the reasons why I joined BSF as the head of the education department. Sophie Pelloux After a PhD in biology, I finally became a general practitioner. I have always been interested in education, in medicine and beyond, and I strongly believe that each student should learn at his/her own pace. I discovered Khan Academy several years ago, while I was trying to help my cousins understand math. One of their issues at that time was that the content was available in English but not in French‚Ä¶ I am glad to see that the mathematical part is now ready to run in French, and to have the opportunity to translate the health content videos! Nicolas Roux I am currently involved in a PhD where I study water resource in arctic areas, where permafrost (frozen ground) makes access difficult. Teaching is for me as important as research, so I naturally saw in Khan Academy a unique opportunity to reach a larger audience than the one classic teaching could ever possibly allow me to reach.

Prior to this release, the mission dashboard consisted exclusively of practice and mastery tasks‚Äìproblems to practice and interact with the skills. If a student didn‚Äôt know how to do a particular exercise, they would have to rely on the video in the specific skill or manually look up the video, and there was no way to know ahead of time which videos are particularly useful and which aren‚Äôt. With this in mind, we decided to research which videos on our site are most effective in helping people learn. We then wanted to explore how we could make sure students see these videos when trying to learn related skills. Many of our exercises are tagged with ‚Äúcurated related videos‚Äù‚Äîvideos that are hand-selected as related to the exercise. Using this as a starting point, we looked at all the videos that were already tagged as related to any exercise. For each of these videos, we compared the accuracy on its associated exercise both before watching the video and after watching it. From there, we selected the top fifty most effective videos, each improving the accuracy on its associated exercise by at least twenty percent, and are now highlighting them on the mission dashboard. When the system recommends an exercise with an associated video on the list of our top fifty related videos, it will automatically recommend the related video as well. Similarly, when an exercise with an associated video task is manually added to a student‚Äôs list of exercises as a personal task, the video task will also be added automatically. A student might watch the video before attempting the exercise, which is why we place the video tasks immediately above its associated exercise. Alternatively, a student may want to attempt the exercise first, and if they struggle with the exercise then they can close it out temporarily and watch the video before trying again. If a student doesn‚Äôt need to watch the video, the video task can disappear in three ways. If the student watches the video, the video task will never reappear for that student. The student can also remove the video task without watching it and it will never again be shown to them. Finally, if the student completes the associated exercise and renavigates to the mission dashboard (refreshing the page, e.g.), the video task will also go away. However, in this last scenario, if the exercise ever reappears on the mission dashboard of this student, the video task will also return. We sincerely hope you find this update as exciting and useful as we do!", "date": "2014-09-05"},

It‚Äôs a sequence of steps that you follow to solve a problem. In everyday life, you might have an algorithm for hanging up your laundry, efficiently going through a shopping list, or finding an empty parking space in a lot. In computer science, an algorithm is a sequence of instructions that a computer program follows. Algorithms form the basis of the most interesting and important programs we use, such as the algorithm that Google uses to calculate driving directions, or the algorithm that Facebook uses to automatically tag you in a photo. Because algorithms are so important to computer science, they are a core part of a computer science curriculum. The AP CS A class teaches object-oriented programming with algorithms, ¬†every college CS student will have at least one algorithms class and encounter algorithms everywhere, and every software engineer interviewing for a job will review algorithms while they‚Äôre prepping for an interview. Given how important algorithms are, we were elated when Dartmouth professors Thomas Cormen and Devin Balkcom suggested writing an online course on Algorithms, available to anyone for free, forever, on Khan Academy. If you‚Äôre a college CS student, you might recognize the name ‚ÄúCormen‚Äù ‚Äì he‚Äôs the ‚ÄúC‚Äù in the ‚ÄúCLRS‚Äù-authored Algorithms textbook, the most popular algorithms textbook used by college classes. Balkcom is a fellow professor at Dartmouth, and he‚Äôs actually rewritten their introductory CS class, so he‚Äôs an expert in teaching algorithms to new computer science students. We worked over the summer to create an introductory Algorithms class that‚Äôs highly interactive. Algorithms can be hard to wrap your head around, so we have both step-by-step diagrams and interactive visualizations to explain each algorithm: We also want to give you a chance to try coding the algorithms yourself, so we‚Äôve used our JavaScript coding challenge framework to write 19 challenges with unit tests (and you‚Äôll have to write unit tests yourself!): We‚Äôve also sprinkled in a few quizzes, to make sure you understand concepts like asymptotic and graph notation: This curriculum covers everything you‚Äôd find in an intro course ‚Äì asymptotic notation, binary search, selection/insertion sort, recursion, merge/quick sort, graph representation, and breadth first search. There‚Äôs much more to cover, of course, including going more into how you can design your own algorithms, but we‚Äôre so excited about what we have now and how much it could help software engineers in all stages of life that we want to get it in your hands now.

Well, it all started with me forgetting to buy a gift for my mum. I was in 6th grade, and it was Mother‚Äôs Day. We lived a few hours walk from the shops in town, and I had to walk by a high-security penitentiary to get to those shops ‚Äì given the recent surge in prison escapes, I didn‚Äôt feel like taking the risk. I‚Äôd been browsing the web a lot recently, checking out the fan websites for my favorite boy bands and hanging out in pet-themed chat rooms. I always liked the idea of making gifts instead of buying gifts, so I thought ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôll make my mum a webpage!‚Äù I searched on Yahoo! for instructions (this was even before the days of Google‚Äôing), and made a webpage for my mum with a big cheesy ‚ÄúHappy Mother‚Äôs Day‚Äù GIF at the top (thanks, Microsoft Word Art!). My mum was happy that I‚Äôd taken the effort to learn something new; I was happy that I‚Äôd discovered how to get away with never buying gifts and I was left with a newfound curiosity for making things on the web. And that‚Äôs how I got into programming. I started off in HTML and then got into Perl, Java, JavaScript, PHP‚Äîanything I could get my hands that would enable me to share creations on the web. Now, nearly 2 decades later, the web is ubiquitous and there are more than 1 billion websites on the internet. Every single one of those websites is built with HTML, and probably many of them include CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm thrilled that we can now teach HTML and CSS on Khan Academy. HTML/CSS is the first step on the path to being a web developer, plus it‚Äôs also a skill that non-developers can hugely benefit from ‚Äì like bloggers, marketers, and librarians ‚Äì because HTML shows up in so many of their jobs, too. You can try out our HTML/CSS environment here . It‚Äôs interactive and real-time, just like our ProcessingJS environment , plus includes a color picker, image picker, and number scrubbers. To help you learn how to make webpages, we‚Äôve put together an Intro to HTML/CSS course .

Biking to the hospital in the snow, day after day after day (it was in Boston), during residency. Wet scrubs are no fun. 2. Talking to a teenage girl who was embarrassed about having to find a prom dress that would cover the large psoriasis plaques on her elbows 3. High-fiving and hugging a patient-turned-friend moments after finding out his leukemia was in remission! 4. Helping to give a baby its first breath‚Ä¶ 5. Studying for the MCAT¬Æ exam (Medical College Admission Test) Are you surprised that last one made the list? Don‚Äôt be. I studied for the MCAT for weeks and weeks, and walked out feeling drained. It was a grueling experience and I was a basket case, running around trying to balance my class-load with finding reliable study materials and knocking out practice questions on weekends. For three long months, I ate, slept, studied, and stressed (in that order). But I realize that the work I put into preparing helped get me ready for medical school. This April, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) is unveiling a new and improved MCAT exam. More than 80,000 individuals will take this new test on their road to medical school each year. And with the help of the AAMC and a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Khan Academy has built resources to help students prepare for the exam. For the past two years, we‚Äôve worked with a fantastic team of educators to create more than 900 videos and 2,000 questions spanning all of the foundational concepts tested on the new exam. These include biochemistry , biology , physiology , physics , chemistry , and ‚Äì for the first time ever ‚Äì the social sciences, specifically psychology and sociology . It‚Äôs amazing to think that within four years, students taking the new MCAT are going to be physicians in every single clinic, hospital, and operating theater across the United States and Canada.

Sherry*, a 5th grade student, didn‚Äôt want to come to Google. For months she‚Äôd been working hard on LearnStorm, the Khan Academy math challenge, and had earned a top spot on the leaderboards. For weeks our team had been working with Google to build the most epic final award celebration we could devise. We asked her teacher, Jen Ellison, what was up and the response was heartbreaking: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ride in cars much.‚Äù Ms. Ellison said Sherry‚Äôs response reminded her of the crippling effects of poverty. Sherry is ten years old. She doesn‚Äôt often leave her neighborhood. ‚ÄúDriving an hour away might as well be the moon.‚Äù The thing is, this kind of self-limiting thinking is not only a problem for kids from underserved neighborhoods: most people are held back in some way by their mindset. Last year Edelman-Berland helped us do a poll that showed that the majority of people think their intelligence level is fixed. The research shows not only that this is inaccurate, but also that when students think this way, their test scores suffer, and they are less likely to take on the learning challenges that will set them up for future success. We designed LearnStorm as a direct attack on these ways of thinking. We knew that to be truly impactful we would need to create a hands-on way to practice positive learning mindsets. Could we design a math challenge that taught a lot more than just math? We launched LearnStorm in the Bay Area as a pilot. Based on what we‚Äôd learned from other math competitions, we aimed to reach at least one percent of students in grades 3-12, which is about 13,000. Three months later, over 73,000 students from about 1,600 Bay Area schools have participated in LearnStorm. They‚Äôve earned points and prizes not only for mastering math skills but also for showing ‚Äúhustle,‚Äù a metric we created to measure grit, perseverance, and growth. They competed over 200,000 hours of learning and 13.6 million standards-aligned math problems. In addition, thanks to the generosity of Google.org, DonorsChoose.org, and Comcast‚Äôs Internet Essentials, 34 underserved schools unlocked new devices for their classrooms and free home internet service for eligible families, increasing student access to online learning tools like Khan Academy. Bella Vista Elementary, one of the 34 schools that earned new devices for its classrooms through LearnStorm On Saturday, we invited the LearnStorm students who mastered the most math and showed the most hustle to a finals celebration on the Google campus. These students competed in individual and team challenges and earned educational prizes from organizations such as the Exploratorium, Ardusat, the Lawrence Hall of Science, the Tech Museum of Innovation, the California Academy of Sciences, NASA, NASCAR, and the San Francisco 49ers. Thanks to the efforts of her teacher, Ms. Ellison, Sherry was there. Thanks to her grit, determination and growth in math, she earned a prize and was celebrated by 300 of her peers from across the Bay Area at the heart of Google. As Ms. Ellison put it: ‚ÄúLearnStorm taught us about hope, endurance and grit‚Ä¶ It taught us to encourage one another because everyone struggles. It taught us that you can learn anything. It taught us that we are capable of more than we can imagine‚Ä¶. Oh, and we learned some math, too.‚Äù Teacher Jen Ellison tells Sal her school‚Äôs story (photograph by Andrew Weeks). At Khan Academy we‚Äôve been inspired by Sherry and all the participants, volunteers, teachers and parents who made this LearnStorm pilot such a success. We‚Äôre working with the same hustle, grit and determination to make LearnStorm bigger and better. So stay tuned for updates later this year! ‚Äì James Tynan, Adoption Lead", "date": "2015-05-13"},

Of the folks who earned the Summer Surge badge, 53,035 of them earned more than 145,878 energy points, which was my summer total. These summer superstars have been awarded the I Beat Cam badge: Super huge congrats to everyone who beat me! Your work is both inspiring and humbling. To see whether you earned one of these badges, log in to Khan Academy, go to your profile , and click ‚Äúbadges.‚Äù My summer learning goals Two of my main objectives this summer were learning to unicycle and learning to juggle clubs. I had some struggles along the way‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶but with practice I learned both skills and even put them together for the Khan Academy talent show: I also learned some finance and economics on Khan Academy, two subjects I‚Äôm interested in but never studied in school. It was a blast! Seriously, it‚Äôs hard to beat the thrill of truly wrapping your mind around a new concept or acquiring a new skill. Thank you to everyone who participated in the Summer Surge!

This was the first summer that students ‚Äì or, ‚Äúscholars‚Äù as they are recognized in BELL‚Äôs programs ‚Äì encountered Khan Academy‚Äôs free coding course, Intro to JavaScript , as a summer elective. ¬†The two nonprofit organizations are also expanding individualized learning opportunities for scholars through Khan Academy‚Äôs free math resources, based on scholars‚Äô individual needs identified by the results of the pre-program computer adaptive assessments. Here‚Äôs how it all works: ¬†the school leaders and teachers who deliver BELL‚Äôs summer learning programs for scholars in grades K-8 can choose to integrate the free Khan Academy math and coding resources into their summer learning plans, based on variables such as scholar needs and technology access. ¬†BELL provides training, instructor guides and resources (such as primers, video tutorials, and sample reports) and ongoing coaching via email and webinars. Teachers, scholars, and parents can all access the math and coding resources, and continue using them after the summer program concludes. In fact, at a site visit at Davidson, Emily Radwin, BELL‚Äôs Learning and Assessment Systems specialist, was able to hear from both scholars and staff that many scholars were choosing to work on coding projects at home and on the weekends. The Khan Academy coding curriculum also allows scholars to work collaboratively in pairs, and has opportunities for scholars to have ‚Äúfree time‚Äù and use what they‚Äôve learned to work on free-form coding projects. ‚ÄúOne of the most rewarding things for me is to see the class so engaged by the curriculum,‚Äù said Anne Carmin, a teacher at the Davidson Middle School. ‚ÄúScholars are excited to be here.‚Äù You read that correctly: the opportunity to learn about computer programming, while also honing their academic skills, motivates scholars and makes them excited to spend a big part of their summer ‚Äì five weeks, five days per week, six hours per day ‚Äì at school. ‚ÄúI like that we get to try out new things each day,‚Äù said Hendy. ¬†One of his favorite activities was creating clouds with his newfound coding skills. ¬†Jossie agreed. ¬†‚ÄúI like that we get to try new things here at BELL.

The Centennial School District in Warminster, Pennsylvania, reports that middle school students who spent at least 30 minutes per week doing mastery learning on Khan Academy had 33% higher growth on the NWEA MAP mathematics assessment than students who used Khan Academy for less than 15 minutes per week. Elementary school students had 19% higher growth. Kudos to the kids at Centennial for all their hard work! Mastery learning is an educational philosophy centered on self-paced learning. Unlike traditional learning, students in mastery-learning classrooms are not pushed ahead in lockstep, which can cause the accumulation of debilitating ‚ÄúSwiss-cheese‚Äù gaps in knowledge. In mastery learning, students learn at their own pace. They progress through questions and quizzes at just the right level for them. They get feedback as they learn and help when they need it most. Teachers track student progress, identify gaps, and give students one-on-one attention to help them succeed. Mastery learning is backed by decades of research. The noted researcher Benjamin Bloom first coined the term mastery learning in 1968 and published a seminal 1984 study that documented its promise. A 1994 analysis of nearly 300 studies on mastery learning found that mastery learning has a ‚Äúpositive effect on achievement at all levels and for all subjects and results in positive affective outcomes for students and teachers.‚Äù Mastery lessons on Khan Academy are available for K‚Äì12 math, grammar, high school biology, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Physics 1, AP Statistics, AP Government and Politics, and AP Macroeconomics.

By the July LSAT, the percentage was up to 32%. By September, it was up to 33%. And by the November LSAT, the most recent test for which we have data, 44% of respondents said they had used it. And when we started digging into the numbers, we got even more excited. Based on the early data from the first four LSATs, the free, high-quality test preparation resources from Khan Academy and LSAC are seeing particularly high use among women and students from underrepresented minority groups. Based on our survey(1) of candidates who took the LSAT for the first time in November 2018, we found the following: ‚Äì 52% of African American respondents reported they use our Khan Academy OfÔ¨Åcial LSAT Prep to help prepare for the exam. ‚Äì 47% of Puerto Rican respondents reported using Khan Academy to prepare. ‚Äì 42% of Native American and Alaska Native respondents reported using Khan Academy to prepare. ‚Äì 41% of Hispanic respondents reported using Khan Academy to prepare. ‚Äì 38% of Asian respondents reported using Khan Academy to prepare. ‚Äì 46% of women respondents reported using Khan Academy to prepare, compared to 41% of male respondents. We hope this is the beginning of a new and exciting trend. One of our top goals is to expand and diversify the pipeline of candidates who can see themselves pursuing a career in law and advocacy. Providing the right tools and resources to attract more women and minority students to law school is a critical part of a broader effort to create a legal profession that truly reflects the full diversity of our society. Based on responses to surveys of all first-time LSAT test takers between June and November 2018, students from disadvantaged economic backgrounds are recognizing the benefits and opportunity of our Khan Academy Official LSAT Prep. Students who rated their family income as ‚Äúbelow average‚Äù or ‚Äúfar below average‚Äù compared to other members of their communities had the greatest proportion of test takers who prepared using the free LSAT prep. Another huge issue we wanted to help address with free LSAT Prep was the burden of student debt, which affects so many young people today and can have a chilling effect on their educational and career choices. It‚Äôs hard to envision spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars for commercial test preparation services when you‚Äôre already saddled with huge student loan debt. So, we hoped that free, high-quality, individualized LSAT prep through Khan Academy in collaboration with LSAC could be a game changer for many students. So far, survey response data appears to support our hypothesis. In general, the survey responses indicate that the higher the level of student debt a candidate has, the more likely they are to use Khan. For example, for respondents who reported some undergraduate debt up to $39,999, about 37% of them reported preparing with our free Khan Academy Official LSAT Prep. For respondents who reported $40,000 or more in debt, the number was even higher‚Äî41% reported using it. While the survey results reflect use of the free LSAT Prep among first-time LSAT test takers, prevalence among candidates taking the LSAT for the second or third time is somewhat lower, as we expected. Khan Academy LSAT Prep wasn‚Äôt available when many of those candidates started to study and prepare for the LSAT. But even among all LSAT test takers, we see a similar pattern of an increasing trend toward using Official LSAT Prep to prepare for the LSAT. This has truly been a groundbreaking partnership. In less than a year, our investment in free, high-quality online LSAT prep resources and tools is helping thousands of students‚Äîparticularly women, minority students, and economically disadvantaged students‚Äîget the practice and individualized help they need to demonstrate their full capabilities on the LSAT and pursue a career in law. It‚Äôs amazing to realize that 40,000 students are using our free online LSAT Prep tools and resources every month. And we know that behind every number and every data point, there is a real person. It‚Äôs gratifying to know these tools and resources are expanding opportunity for all. If you or someone you know is considering a career in law, please let them know about our free online Khan Academy Official LSAT Prep resources.

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Old School, New School: Mastery-Based Learning", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/old-school-new-school-mastery-based-learning/", "abstract": "By Beatrice, a guest blogger who is a junior in high school The high school I attend in Silicon Valley requires all juniors to spend one week participating in an internship or shadow week. I was lucky to be able to spend my week at Khan Academy. ¬†During my shadow week, I learned how Khan Academy reaches people all over the world who are driven to deepen their education. It was also a chance to attend communications team meetings, learn about the testimonial process, and understand how press release requests are handled. Throughout the week, I also realized that Khan Academy, Khan Lab School and the Waldorf school that I attend share the belief that students understand concepts best through mastery-based learning‚Äîan educational pedagogy that allows students to learn at a pace that is suitable to them. At first glance, it might seem surprising that an online learning experience like Khan Academy, a startup like Khan Lab School, and a Waldorf school that has roots in a philosophy that goes back nearly 100 years would have anything in common. (Waldorf schools are based on the teaching principles of Rudolf Steiner and were founded in the early 20th century.) Noticing the common thread of mastery came as a complete surprise during my shadow week. While there are many differences among the three organizations, mastery-based learning is an approach they share. At Khan Academy, over 200 team members are dedicated to providing learners all over the world with a free, world class education. Students, whether they are in classrooms or working independently, can go as fast or as slow as they want, and mastery is central to the way students learn and advance their understanding of Khan Academy subjects. At Khan Lab School, mastery-based learning frequently occurs in blended or project-based environments. This approach advances the idea that students working in a self-paced setting will fully master concepts and skills. In many schools, the time students spent learning is constant and the level of content mastery varies. The opposite is true at Khan Lab School. ¬†The amount of time it takes to learn something can be variable and everyone eventually achieves a mastery level understanding of each subject area. I also learned that students use Khan Academy at Khan Lab School, especially for math and computer science. At Waldorf, mastery is neither blended or online, and our use of technology in high school classes is lower than at other schools. The Waldorf philosophy is based on the idea that a student‚Äôs natural desire to learn is unleashed in an environment where they are seen, feel safe, and have an opportunity to undertake hands-on work. I feel that the interdisciplinary and multimodal approach combined with the ability to resubmit work until it is mastered has given me agency over my learning, critical thinking skills, and a sense of empathy. At Waldorf, I have learned that it is not the academic skills that matter most but rather the ability to learn how to learn. Interestingly, Khan Lab School has a similar philosophy. During my shadow week at Khan Academy, I learned that there are many different facets to the operational side of an educational organization. Shadowing Barb and Rachel from Khan Academy‚Äôs communications team gave me a feel for what they‚Äôre trying to get across to students, teachers, districts, and the wider world. One way they do this is by communicating with the media and arranging interviews for Sal, Khan Academy‚Äôs founder, and other members of the Khan Academy team. I enjoyed having a front row seat to this one area of Khan Academy. One last thing I‚Äôd like to share is that Khan Academy reaches 18 million learners a month in 190 countries in over 30 languages as a nonprofit. I personally know of many students who would not be able to use Khan Academy if they had to pay a subscription fee. During my shadow week, I encountered even more students around the world whose lives have been changed significantly by Khan Academy. Because it is a nonprofit, Khan Academy depends on donations from individuals to help sustain the work they are doing now and the work they need to do in the future. For me, it has been heartening to learn how individuals have been impacted around the world through access to Khan Academy. Onward!

Amy attended our inaugural Khan Academy Ambassador Summer Summit in July and we‚Äôre delighted to share this guest blog post! By Amy Forsythe My experience at the the pilot Khan Academy Ambassador Summer Summit‚Äî#KhanCon‚Äîwas amazing! My expectation was that I would learn some new tricks for using Khan Academy in my classroom and maybe even get some insider info on what changes will be taking place in the future, and that definitely happened. I not only heard things that will help me in my classroom, but I also got great tips on how Khan Academy can help others. While those tangible learnings were huge, the real WOW moments for me were the connections I made with other Ambassadors and the Khan Academy staff. It is an incredible experience to be around others who share your passion for something. We realized how much we all have in common despite being from different states, different subject areas, different grade levels, and different types of schools. I was also overwhelmed by how much the Khan Academy staff wanted to talk with us and learn about how we use their resources and what challenges we face. I was asked my opinion on things so many times! I was constantly talking with Khan Academy staff during breaks, lunch, and any other times we could find! I didn‚Äôt anticipate that. A theme that kept coming up was looking at student growth over time rather than assignment scores alone, meaning we collectively valued looking at where a student started off and tracking their improvement. With Khan Academy, different students can have different goals for growth and mastery of specific skills‚Äîworking methodically from the foundation up to more advanced learning‚Äîthat they can keep track of themselves so that all students are appropriately challenged. In the past, I‚Äôve focused more on individual assignments. But coming out of the Khan Academy Ambassador Summer Summit, I‚Äôd like to do more with growth and mastery. It was so obvious that the Khan Academy staff wanted to do more than just make a great product. They really want to help teachers have a great impact. Seeing people working so hard to help me do my job more effectively made me so happy! I left #KhanCon knowing more about how to use Khan Academy in my classroom and also knowing that there are so many people who really value what teachers do and want to help them reach as many students as possible, as effectively as possible.

Aviv at Khan Academy : Can you describe your journey to becoming a teacher? Tambra :¬† Before I started teaching, I aspired to work in engineering technologies, and wound up working for a military-based supplier company. This is where I worked on various military equipment during Desert Storm and I got the opportunity to inspect the Atlantis space shuttle windows! I decided to re-attend college at age 48 to complete a degree in secondary education mathematics because I got tired of hearing teens say, ‚ÄúI hate math.‚Äù This is where I learned about Khan Academy from a grad student who was teaching a biology lab I was enrolled in. Aviv at Khan Academy : ¬†That‚Äôs an incredible journey! How did you address the I-hate-math attitude in your early years of teaching? Tambra : I first taught in Roane County, a rural farm community with a high need for math teachers and then at South Charleston High School, a school with a diverse population of under-resourced students. I taught classes from conceptual math to AP Calculus and implanted problem/project-based learning in all of my classes, much to the dismay of my fellow teachers. I asked to have the desks in rows and columns removed and found round tables so my students could work together and collaborate. Khan Academy became a tool for my students to use when questioning the process or their answers when they worked to complete problems in the classroom. Aviv at Khan Academy : Tell me more about how personalized learning fits into your teaching. Tambra : I decided to work towards my master‚Äôs degree in special education to better understand the teaching process for students with special needs. I wanted to use those skills for students who fell through the cracks in the general education classrooms. After receiving my masters, I accepted a position at the same high school to create an engineering program as well as teach the college dual credit classes and AP Calculus. The engineering project was to increase our students in STEM-related courses and careers and to encourage female students to continue in STEM courses. Our current level of 18% female students enrolled in engineering-type courses is well below the national average, and it is my hope to continue to increase this percentage each year. We are on the right track, and have increased our enrollment by almost 400%, have a 3D printing lab, and opened our first chapter of Skills USA for our school! Aviv at Khan Academy : What are your plans for continuing to personalize learning for all students in the future? Tambra : While my master‚Äôs degree addressed many of the questions I had regarding cognitive learning and how it relates to curriculum, I decided to pursue my doctorate in philosophy with a focus on cognition and curriculum psychology in order to design and implement evidence-based interventions to better serve struggling students. It is my goal to get to the heart of I-hate-math statements and encourage my district to use strategies that change the mindset of students, so they will be more motivated to continue pathways that lead to STEM careers. I am currently working on a research topic relating to psychology, math and learning struggles of students in general education. Through this process, I have continued to use Khan Academy, going as far as becoming an Ambassador in order to train and encourage other teachers to use this amazing tool.

You‚Äôll probably see photos and video of Sal wearing a suit and tie accepting his award this week, but our Sal is often in the office wearing shorts and a t-shirt. Sal knows that people learn and work better in a variety of settings and at different times of day, and the culture in our office embraces that mindset. We enjoy a relaxed and casual dress code and are encouraged to work when and where we‚Äôll be most productive. And, of course, Sal started Khan Academy by recording videos in his closet after work, so it‚Äôs always been casual for him. 2) Sal loves to conduct walking meetings. If you have a meeting with Sal on your calendar, chances are you‚Äôll be going for a walk with him outside the office. These walk-and-talk meetings are great for getting more physical exercise and experiencing a change of scenery. Plus, recent research found that walking can lead to increases in creative thinking! 3) Sal‚Äôs favorite book is Pride and Prejudice . When Sal was forced to read Austen, Huxley, and Dickens in school, he hated these classic works of literature. But, when he reread Pride and Prejudice for fun in his twenties, he realized he loved it. What book from your childhood have you reread as an adult and now realize you actually love?

We‚Äôve partnered with NWEA, the creator of MAP Growth, to introduce this new resource. Khan Academy and NWEA are excited to empower teachers with a new way to deeply connect interim assessment to actionable classroom learning. Our goal with MAP Accelerator is to reach the children who need our help most. With MAP Accelerator, we import MAP Growth RIT scores into Khan Academy to automatically place students at their learning edge: ‚Ä¢ Teachers review the learning plan that MAP Accelerator recommends for each student. Teachers can adjust suggested goals in the learning plan as they see fit or accept all goals with a single click. ‚Ä¢ S tudents take ownership over their learning as they progress through their personalized plan using Khan Academy‚Äôs mastery learning system. We foster student agency because students can move ahead or change directions. ‚Ä¢ Districts get an easy-to-implement solution with classroom, school, and district-level reporting; professional learning for teachers; and priority technical support. We recommend 30 or more minutes per week of student learning on MAP Accelerator. As students advance, teachers can use real-time data to make decisions about classroom instruction, form small groups, and provide one-on-one coaching. Research shows that use of Khan Academy is associated with greater than expected growth in mathematics. Completing 60% or more of grade-level math on Khan Academy is associated with 1.8 times expected growth on the mathematics portion of MAP Growth. MAP Accelerator includes math content aligned to MAP Growth for grades three through eight in both English and Spanish. Our mastery learning system is aligned to Common Core State Standards and includes practice exercises with worked solutions, quizzes, unit tests, instructional videos, and articles. We launched a pilot of MAP Accelerator four months ago with five school districts: Clark County School District in Las Vegas, Nevada, Jefferson County School District in Louisville, Kentucky, and Madera Unified School District, Pajaro Valley Unified School District, and Glendale Unified School District in California. Nearly 180,000 students and thousands of teachers are using MAP Accelerator today. We‚Äôre heartened by their progress so far and look forward to great things to come. The pilot is just the start of an exciting new era for classrooms that use MAP Growth. With MAP Accelerator, teachers can not only see where students are in their learning journey but also pinpoint where they need help and generate a personalized learning plan quickly and easily with the click of a button. Students take ownership of their learning as they progress through Khan Academy‚Äôs mastery learning system. We think MAP Accelerator equips teachers to unlock student potential like never before.

Our language advocates lead the effort to translate Khan Academy into dozens of different languages . Their work is crucial to achieving the anywhere part of our mission to provide a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere. Khan Academy staff and language advocates exchanged best practices on everything from raising funds to raising awareness of Khan Academy through social media. Language advocates also shared translation tips and tools with each other and presented to the entire Khan Academy staff about their efforts to make Khan Academy available around the world. Last but certainly not least, each language advocate brought a tasty treat from their home country so everyone could share in a delicious, international buffet. Our language advocates work hard to make sure Khan Academy content isn‚Äôt just translated into different languages but made applicable to each country‚Äôs local context. For example, an English math problem about Susie buying apples may turn into a problem about H√©l√®ne buying grapes in French or Fatima buying mangoes in Hindi. In 2019 we introduced functionality for language advocates to curate Khan Academy content to match their local curricula, and a focus of this year‚Äôs convention was sharing best practices for aligning Khan Academy to each country‚Äôs curricula and implementing Khan Academy in schools. Finally, language advocates met with Sal Khan, our founder and CEO, to discuss the future of Khan Academy as well as the similarity between their efforts to create and launch Khan Academy in new languages today and Sal‚Äôs effort to create and launch Khan Academy 10 years ago.

We asked the Khan Academy content team to share the gifts they love to give the children in their lives. Find a special and educational book, game, subscription, or toy to add to your shopping list. Subscriptions kids will love What‚Äôs better than one great gift? A gift that you receive monthly! Our content team loves these subscription-based gifts for children. Magazine subscriptions ‚ÄúI highly recommend Ranger Rick (and Ranger Rick Jr ) and National Geographic Kids magazine subscriptions.‚Äù Anna Berns, Program manager, international content / localization community liaison Kiwi Crates ‚ÄúI like giving Kiwi Crates , which are great for the five- to eight-year-olds in my life, but Kiwi Co. also has crates for different age groups. I like giving these crates because each one includes super fun, hands-on STEAM projects with associated science and math instruction. I like to give a monthly subscription so they are a gift that keeps on giving.‚Äù Megan Cohn, Biology content creator Books The Khan Academy content team loves to give books as gifts to encourage relationship building and independent learning. A board book for babies ‚ÄúI always give board books as part of my baby shower gifts because the first thing a child should learn about a book is that it helps to build relationships.‚Äù Charlotte Auen, Content creator, math Pre-K through elementary ‚Äú The book Lottie and Walter is good for pre-K to third grade‚Äîa story about overcoming fear and believing in yourself. The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane is a great book to read aloud to young elementary kids or to give as an independent read for older kids. It‚Äôs a beautiful story about how we change for the better if we open our hearts up.‚Äù Allison Leedie, Content creator, English language arts ‚ÄúMy six-year-old daughter loves Bedtime Math so much she wakes me up in the morning to do more of it. The problems are engaging. Each one has three levels of difficulty, so kids of different ages and math readiness can all engage.‚Äù Vicki Lang, Senior content manager, math Middle school recommendations ‚ÄúI would gift puzzle mystery books! They‚Äôre a fun way to stretch your brain and fuel your curiosity. Plus, there‚Äôs nothing more fun than solving a mystery before the main character does. My favorites: The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin, Escape from Mr. Lemoncello‚Äôs Library by Chris Grabenstein, and Chasing Vermeer by Blue Balliett.‚Äù Kim Elliott, Senior content creator, humanities ‚Äú Graceling is for middle school and up. It‚Äôs just a great epic fantasy novel with amazing characters to root for.‚Äù Allison Leedie, Content creator, English language arts HIgh school and beyond ‚Äú Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth is a graphic novel about Bertrand Russell‚Äôs quest for fortifying the logical foundations of mathematics. This amazing book brings out the humanity in the most abstract science of them all. Proofs and Refutations by Imre Lakatos is a harder read and more appropriate for people who have grappled with proving theorems before. Nevertheless, it read like a thriller to me. The book is a Socratic dialogue between a teacher and some students about a proof of a famous theorem and its related definitions, which touches upon the nature of mathematical discovery.‚Äù Tomer Gal, Content creator, math Games and toys A lot of learning can happen when playing the games and toys picked by our content team. Adults will enjoy these picks, too! Guess Who? game ‚Äú Guess Who? is a great educational game for elementary ages and up for practicing categorizing, questioning, and noticing.

The game, as is or with modified characters, works in any language.‚Äù Charlotte Auen, Content creator, math QWIXX and Rat-a-tat Cat ‚ÄúBoth QWIXX (dice) are and Rat-a-tat Cat (cards) are quick to play and a lot of fun. Also, they are great strategic games for elementary-age kids but are fun for everyone!‚Äù Lindsay Spears, Senior content creator, math U.S. Presidents Playing Cards and Women Cards ‚ÄúMost kids can‚Äôt name all of the presidents, so the U.S. Presidents Playing Cards are a good way to remember faces and names. They are also organized in order of succession, so kids could memorize the order just by playing with them if they were playing solitaire or something similar. I also really like the Women Cards Tech Deck .‚Äù Leah Marquez, Content creator, social studies Perplexus Original ‚ÄúI love the Perplexus .

Together, we created Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy ‚Äì a personalized online program that helps students practice for the SAT with thousands of sample questions, instant feedback, video lessons, and full-length practice tests. As word has spread about our free resource, Official SAT Practice sign-ups have grown each year and now total more than 10 million worldwide. Thousands of students have shared their stories about Official SAT Practice and the ways the program helped them improve their SAT scores. Here are just a few of those stories: ‚ÄúAll I had before was a dictionary and books I could take from the library.

We‚Äôre determined to do everything we can to help students keep learning. With that goal in mind, we‚Äôve launched new math courses to equip students with the critical skills they‚Äôll need for the fall. We designed the courses, called Get Ready for Grade Level, to help students master the most important skills they‚Äôll need for the next grade. What‚Äôs more, students can use our new courses to figure out where they may have gaps before they enter that grade. Teachers can also use Get Ready for Grade Level at back-to-school time to complement grade-level instruction. The courses are available in English on our website and mobile app today. Like all our courses, they are completely free. Get Ready for Third Grade Get Ready for Fourth Grade Get Ready for Fifth Grade Get Ready for Sixth Grade Get Ready for Seventh Grade Get Ready for Eighth Grade Get Ready for Algebra 1 Get Ready for Geometry Get Ready for Algebra 2 Get Ready for Precalculus Preparaci√≥n para 3.er grado Preparaci√≥n para 4.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para 5.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para 6.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para 7.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para 8.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para √Ålgebra I Preparaci√≥n para Geometr√≠a Preparaci√≥n para √Ålgebra II Preparaci√≥n para Prec√°lculo Sal Khan, our founder, calls the gaps students sometimes develop ‚ÄúSwiss cheese gaps.‚Äù They can build up over time. If enough gaps build up, students can hit a wall. This year the gaps are particularly concerning because of school closures. Research from NWEA shows some students could be nearly a year behind in math come fall. While the learning loss from Covid-19 may be significant, our math experts have designed Get Ready for Grade Level to help. Students start by taking a Course Challenge. The Course Challenge helps them understand what they need to review. If they have gaps for the grade they‚Äôre entering in the fall, students spend their time mastering the important skills they need to fill those gaps. If they don‚Äôt have gaps, students accelerate ahead and brush up on the skills they need for next school year. All our lessons are Common Core aligned. Parents and teachers alike can track student progress through our parent and teacher dashboards. Also, a fun note for middle and high school: We‚Äôre launching Camp Khan , a 10-week summer math challenge for ages 13 and up. Students can get weekly tips and advice as well as recognition of their accomplishments as they progress through Get Ready for Grade Level. Happy learning this summer! Nuevos cursos de matem√°ticas para que los estudiantes est√©n listos al volver a clases Ahora que estamos iniciando el verano en Estados Unidos, sabemos que muchos est√°n preocupados de qu√© tan preparados est√°n para el pr√≥ximo a√±o escolar. Queremos ayudar a los estudiantes a que sigan aprendiendo y, con esa meta en mente, creamos cursos nuevos de matem√°ticas para que los estudiantes est√©n equipados con las habilidades m√°s importantes que necesitar√°n al volver a clases. Dise√±amos los cursos, que se llaman Preparaci√≥n para el nivel de grado, para ayudarle a los estudiantes a dominar las habilidades m√°s importantes que necesitar√°n para el grado al que van a entrar. Es m√°s, nuestros estudiantes pueden usar nuestros cursos nuevos para saber si tienen lagunas antes de entrar a ese grado. Los maestros tambi√©n pueden usar los cursos de Preparaci√≥n para el nivel de grado cuando empiecen las clases para complementar la instrucci√≥n de sus clases. Los cursos est√°n disponibles en ingl√©s y espa√±ol en nuestro sitio web y nuestra aplicaci√≥n m√≥vil. Como todos nuestros cursos, son completamente gratuitos. Preparaci√≥n para 3.er grado Preparaci√≥n para 4.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para 5.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para 6.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para 7.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para 8.¬∫ grado Preparaci√≥n para √Ålgebra I Preparaci√≥n para Geometr√≠a Preparaci√≥n para √Ålgebra II Preparaci√≥n para Prec√°lculo Get Ready for Third Grade Get Ready for Fourth Grade Get Ready for Fifth Grade Get Ready for Sixth Grade Get Ready for Seventh Grade Get Ready for Eighth Grade Get Ready for Algebra 1 Get Ready for Geometry Get Ready for Algebra 2 Get Ready for Precalculus Sal Khan, nuestro fundador, ha hablado de las lagunas que los estudiantes tienen a veces, y de c√≥mo pueden crecer con el tiempo. Mientras m√°s lagunas tengan, m√°s dificultad para avanzar tendr√°n los estudiantes. Este a√±o esas lagunas son m√°s preocupantes por los cierres escolares. Una investigaci√≥n de NWEA (enlace en ingl√©s) muestra c√≥mo, para el inicio de clases, algunos estudiantes podr√≠an estar atrasados un a√±o en sus habilidades de matem√°ticas. Dado a que la p√©rdida de aprendizaje por el COVID-19 puede ser significante, nuestros expertos de matem√°ticas dise√±aron los cursos de Preparaci√≥n de nivel de grado para ayudarles. Los estudiantes empezar√°n con un Desaf√≠o de curso. El Desaf√≠o de curso les ayudar√° a saber lo que tienen que volver a ver. Si tienen lagunas para el a√±o que van a empezar en el inicio de clases, los estudiantes pasar√°n su tiempo dominando habilidades importantes para acabar con esas lagunas. Si no tienen lagunas, los estudiantes pueden avanzar y repasar las habilidades que necesitar√°n en el pr√≥ximo a√±o escolar. Todos nuestros cursos est√°n alineados con los Est√°ndares Acad√©micos Fundamentales de Estados Unidos (Common Core). Tanto los padres como los maestros pueden seguir el avance de los estudiantes a trav√©s del panel de padres y de profesores. Adem√°s, una nota para los estudiantes de secundaria: Lanzamos Camp Khan , un campamento virtual de 10 semanas con retos de matem√°ticas y diversi√≥n para los mayores de 13 a√±os en los Estados Unidos. Los estudiantes recibir√°n consejos semanales y reconocimiento por sus logros mientras avanzan en su curso de Preparaci√≥n para nivel de grado. ¬°Vamos a divertirnos aprendiendo este verano!", "date": "2020-06-16"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Honoring Juneteenth: A day to listen, learn and take action", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/honoring-juneteenth/", "abstract": "One hundred fifty-five years ago today, enslaved Black Americans in Texas finally learned from a Union Army general that slavery had been abolished; it had taken over two and a half years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation and two months after General Lee‚Äôs surrender at Appomattox Courthouse for word to reach them. Juneteenth is traditionally a day to celebrate freedom and Black history and culture. But this year, we are in mourning for the senseless killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, and many others. We at Khan Academy stand firmly in solidarity with the Black community and the Black Lives Matter movement in the fight against racism. Our mission is to provide a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere. Khan Academy exists to help all learners, but most especially students without access to the educational resources they need to achieve their full potential. We have shared and will continue to share resources about the history and experiences of Black people so we can help educate ourselves and our community and drive real change. We are committed to doing the work to learn and grow as an organization so we can better serve the students who need us most. We see this Juneteenth as an opportunity to reflect both on where we‚Äôve come from and how much further we as a society must go to end systemic racism. We have declared Juneteenth as a permanent Khan Academy company holiday to honor Black history. The fight against injustice, inequality, and police brutality faced by the Black community is far from over, and we must take action together. As a first step, today, we encourage you to learn more about Black history and culture , including why Juneteenth is such an important day in US history.", "date": "2020-06-18"},

{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Helping students who need it most: how one teacher keeps kids learning over the summer", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/helping-students-who-need-it-most-how-one-teacher/", "abstract": "Kenya McGriff understands the importance of keeping students learning over the summer, this year especially. Every summer students show patterns of learning loss, but with school closures due to COVID-19, the NWEA estimates that students may return in fall 2020 with less than 50% of typical learning gains and‚Äîin some grades‚Äînearly a full year behind . McGriff is continuing to teach this summer through Upward Bound, a federal program to support high school students from low-income families and families in which neither parent holds a bachelor‚Äôs degree. She‚Äôs also encouraging students in her school to participate in Khan Academy‚Äôs free, virtual summer camp, Camp Khan . McGriff is a Khan Academy Ambassador and teaches seventh-grade math and pre-algebra at Allapattah Flats K‚Äì8 school in Port St. Lucie, Florida. We asked McGriff to share her experiences helping students avoid learning loss over the summer. Khan Academy: Can you tell us about your work with the Upward Bound program? Kenya McGriff: The Upward Bound program provides support to students who may be financially challenged or are potential first-generation college students. Students are given the opportunity to participate in curricula and programs that will prepare them for college. This summer I am teaching Middle School ELA for the Upward Bound program at Indian River State College in Fort Pierce, Florida. I am working in the Summer CROP (College Reach Out Program). This is my first year. Khan Academy: Are your Upward Bound courses remote? And if so, are you experiencing any challenges with remote learning? McGriff: The courses are virtual, and I have four classes that rotate between technology, math, English/language arts, and French/Creole. The challenges that I‚Äôve faced with teaching remotely include monitoring small group activities. It‚Äôs not like in a classroom, where you can just look over and see the students who are not working. They are able to go into a separate virtual room with their group. Sometimes when I leave my small group to check on another, someone has disappeared. I‚Äôve learned to reward the groups that are the most productive. Khan Academy: How have you used Khan Academy in the Upward Bound program? McGriff: I have kids in one group work on Khan Academy‚Äôs ELA Beta. I was not given a curriculum to work from, so I based my curriculum around the first skills listed in ELA Beta. The other group works with me for about 20 minutes reading and discussing a novel. Then, we switch. The group that is the most productive earns free time. They get to leave class three minutes early, or I give them an automatic 100 on the lesson. Khan Academy: Why did you think Khan Academy would be a good fit for your Upward Bound courses? McGriff: I thought Khan Academy would be a good fit because I use it during the regular school day in my math class. When I‚Äôm not able to explain to students how to do something because I‚Äôm with another group, the kids can ‚Äúget a hint‚Äù on Khan Academy that walks them through how to solve the problem or just gives them enough information to start them off. I love the fact that I can monitor progress so easily and the kids can‚Äôt cheat. The questions are different. So, kids sitting next to each other can help each other figure out how to solve the problem, but one kid can‚Äôt just copy another. Khan Academy: How have you been using Camp Khan with your students over the summer? McGriff: I created class codes for third through eight grade so that students can participate in Camp Khan over the summer . My principal sent out a schoolwide email to all of the families. So, the students are signing up on their own and using the class codes that I made. Khan Academy: How long have you been using Khan Academy in your classroom, and what results have you seen? McGriff: I have been using Khan Academy for about four years now. I am also the math department chair at my school. I taught professional development at the beginning of the year. I emphasized how Khan Academy eliminates work by giving teachers ready-made centers and doing progress monitoring for you. Later on in the year, someone from the district office in the curriculum department asked what we were using to improve our scores (because our scores have improved nicely). My principal told them about Khan Academy. Another school in our district that has had similar increases in scores also attributed the progress to Khan Academy. By spring break, the principal made Khan Academy a schoolwide requirement for the whole math department (elementary and middle). Unfortunately, it was short lived because of Covid-19. I have always received compliments on my students‚Äô scores. Khan Academy makes progress monitoring so easy now. One of the main reasons that I use Khan Academy is because I‚Äôve noticed that the practice questions that we have on the state test almost mirror the same questions that kids have on Khan Academy.", "date": "2020-07-09"},
{"website": "KhanAcademy", "title": "Three new study tips to help you make the most of your time on Official SAT Practice", "author": "Unknown", "link": "https://blog.khanacademy.org/introducing-new-recommended-best-practices-for-official-sat-practice/", "abstract": "Today we‚Äôre glad to share news about Official SAT Practice , our free resource for students who are preparing for the SAT. We‚Äôve learned that how you spend your time on Official SAT Practice really matters. Our research shows there are three best practices that are associated with substantial improvements in SAT scores when students practice for at least six hours: Leveling up your skills. Leveling up provides a signal that you‚Äôre consistently advancing in the content tested on the SAT, and it‚Äôs a marker for learning progress. Taking a full-length practice test. A practice exam simulates the real test experience and helps you see what you know and don‚Äôt know. Eight full-length practice tests are available on Official SAT Practice. Following your personalized practice recommendations. The recommendations are based on your previous scores on the PSAT, SAT, or mini diagnostic quizzes. They help you stay focused on areas where you need the most help. Focusing on these three best practices will help you make the most effective use of your time on Khan Academy‚Äîyou‚Äôll know the practice you‚Äôre doing is targeted. Students from the class of 2019 who used Official SAT Practice for six or more hours and engaged in at least one best practice scored 39 points higher on their first SAT than students who did not use Official SAT Practice. (For folks who work in education research circles, that‚Äôs a .20 effect size. We think it‚Äôs quite promising! Here‚Äôs the summary of findings .) The score improvement trends hold true regardless of demographic characteristics like gender, race, parental education level, and PSAT score, which is important because our goal is to help level the playing field for all test takers. We launched free Official SAT Practice in 2015 in partnership with the College Board. Official SAT Practice is a personalized platform that helps students practice for the SAT with sample questions, instant feedback, video lessons, and full-length practice tests. Sign-ups have grown each year and now total more than 10 million users worldwide.
