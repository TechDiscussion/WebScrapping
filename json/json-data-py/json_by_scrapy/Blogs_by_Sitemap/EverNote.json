That’s exactly what happened in Australia and Singapore last month as a few of our local Evernote Certified Consultants (ECCs), along with Joshua Zerkel , Evernote’s Director of Global Community and Training, held live events to talk about productivity and work on the go. Sponsored by global tech education company General Assembly , these events were attended by hundreds of people. They gathered to ask these highly-trained consultants about the secrets of their trade, and how to use Evernote to supercharge their business processes. The ECCs on the panels had a wide variety of expertise in small business, sales, IT, creative services, start-ups, and education. But all of them shared a passion for teaching people how to be more productive with Evernote. Here’s a recap of the stories and tips the ECCs shared, both “down under” and in Singapore. ECC Helen Crozier takes the Sydney stage with her client,  Kim Jones of Crybaby Productions “Stop writing things down. You don’t have time for that.” Helen Crozier , a productivity-based technology coach catering to Australian small businesses, is a busy woman. Her clients need to get organized and get moving—fast. As a business person herself, Helen gets that. That’s why she advises her clients to automate your most used office tasks. “I use IFTTT to add buttons to business owners’ home screens as widgets,” she explained. “You can set up these buttons to get reminders and or add ideas in Evernote quickly, and the IFTTT recipe can even put them in the right notebook,” she said. “With one button, your ideas or reminders or actions get automatically tagged, and you don’t have to write things down. You don’t have time for that. You can even use Siri to speak your idea right into Evernote for later.” Another app that offers such integrations is Zapier , which gives you even more flexibility. A full house in Singapore But when writing makes a better impression… ECC Stephen Dolan specializes in sales productivity, and he knows that customer interactions and impressions matter the most. Sometimes typing on an open laptop or phone during a sales meeting can put a barrier between salesperson and client. “It’s distracting to type notes in sales meetings,” he said. “I encourage people to write notes by hand, and then scan them with the Evernote camera or Scannable later.” Sure, it’s discreet and it makes a better impression, but how do you make sense of all those scanned notes? Steven introduced the audience to Cloze, an app he depends upon to manage business and personal relationships. “Cloze presents the information that you need in a timeline,” Stephen explained. “Evernote connects with Cloze, so your notes appear in that timeline, and all your to-dos, contacts, and notes appear on it. It’s essential for relationship management.” Calendars are so “last year” “I get nervous if I don’t have my phone with me,” said WanFadzil WanSidik , an ECC with 20 years’ experience as a productivity consultant. Confessing that he doesn’t even try to remember the details of his complicated life, he depends on Evernote as an “indispensable tool” to keep it all together. He organizes Evernote differently than some of the other ECCs, and his ingenious system creates a running agenda for him. “I organize by year, month, date, and time,” he said. “If I sort this way, then I don’t have to do anything to set my schedule for the day. I just look at Evernote, and it’s already there. There was a point when I stopped using calendars altogether. Just let Evernote tags automatically generate a calendar for you .” An event attendee diligently takes notes at the event at Inspire9, Melbourne Tags vs. Notebooks: It’s an argument that never needs to happen In the battle of tags or notebooks , Charlynn Miller doesn’t take sides. She’s an ECC who is transitioning from teaching in Melbourne’s vibrant academic culture to full-time consulting, specializes in the IT and Education market, and uses tags and notebooks equally to enhance her organization. “I have a business notebook, and each project also has its own notebook,” she said. That’s how I do expenses and bills, and my bookkeeper loves me for it,” she added. “All my business content is only going to grow over time. I tag everything I do inside of notebooks so I can find things any way I want.” Learn even more from Evernote Community Consultants. Watch this extended interview with Sydney-based ECCs and get even more tips and tricks. Playing Tag with Templates Jess Padbury is a systems strategist for the creative professions. Living on a farm in southern Australia, Jess also serves as a volunteer firefighter, so she knows a lot about the importance of always being ready to go. “ I never have to say ‘sorry, I left that back in the office’ Jess told the audience. “I can have everything I need with me in Evernote, and talk to everything else. ” Josh consults with ECC presenters prior to the Melbourne event For her consulting practice, she’s launching a podcast, and she’s using Evernote templates to create and manage her content calendar. It’s a strategy she shared with her creative clients, like Elle Lynn , Creative Director of JuJu Creative Hub . Jess helped Elle organize her content creation using Evernote, and introduced her to Evernote’s team collaboration capabilities. “We put all our content for publication into templates for consistency, and we use Evernote tags to identify where we are in the process of getting it done and out the door,” Elle said. “We have tags for drafts, copy that’s ready to be edited, something that’s just an idea, or if something is ready for publishing. If you click on the tags, you can batch similar content by what needs to be done , and work on just those things.” Melbourne ECCs had even more to say offstage. Watch Josh’s interview to pick up even more pro tips. How Evernote stacks up Organizing a business in Evernote is Michael Laing ’s expertise. He gets into the nuts and bolts of working with gigantic quantities of content and keeping it well-managed and available across teams. Organizing groups of notebooks into stacks is one of Michael’s favorite tips, arranging them library-style, so anyone on a team can find exactly what they need immediately.  He then makes each notebook easy to navigate by providing a table of contents note at the start of each one. “Start the week by organizing your work in your notebooks,” he said. “If there is some content that doesn’t fit well into Evernote, such as a long spreadsheet, put it into a relevant note as a link.” He often provides detailed instructions to clients in Evernote, and he “makes them come alive” with annotations and pertinent links. ECC Chi-Kai Huang presents in Singapore Bring Your Own App: The latest in the BYO series A power user of Evernote since 2010, ECC Chi-Kai Huang , who goes by Kai, now specializes in working with early stage startups. “Everybody is always traveling,” he said, “We don’t have the luxury of making sure we’re all on the same page with our projects anymore.” He pointed out that with everyone “bringing their own apps” to work, it’s a challenge to find things easily. “Capturing and saving things is easiest in Evernote,” he said. “You can use Google Drive, you can use Dropbox, whatever you like, but as long as you share the link to Evernote , everybody can see what everyone else is doing.” Want to learn more? Check out this in-depth interview with Evernote professionals in Singapore. Want to uplevel your productivity? Change your mindset ECC Subramanian Narayan brings his clients to Evernote with a caveat: they’re only going to get as much out of it as they put in. “ That goes not only for the notes and notebooks themselves but for the mindset that believes software should be free. “We may live in a world of ‘free,’ he said, “but if you want to make Evernote work really well, there has to be some investment.” He’s talking about more than a willingness to upgrade to an Evernote Business or Premium account. “Evernote integrates with so many apps, and each one makes Evernote more powerful,” Subramanian observed. “You have to take advantage of integrations to extend Evernote’s power.” Get a list of ECC-recommended apps that integrate with Evernote for power productivity for business Josh and the panelists talked to over 600 people live, and the greatest takeaway from all of these events was the opportunity for Evernote enthusiasts to meet each other. Everyone has a favorite tip that others might not know. Some who swear by templates learned about the different ways to organize content in Evernote, others who manage customer lists discovered checklists or using Evernote as a website, a content management system, or as an inventory manager.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Do vs. Done Lists: Jot Down Your Small Wins to Amplify Success", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/do-vs-done-lists-jot-down-your-small-wins/", "abstract": "If you’re reading the Evernote Blog, chances are you’re someone who loves to get things done. To move the needle . But have you ever had the suspicion that the way you’re approaching your to-do list and overall task planning is hindering your effectiveness? Perhaps your processes are increasing stress or anxiety ( known disruptors to problem-solving ) and clouding your creative thought. The power of progress It’s interesting to note that according to research , having a sense of making progress with work that matters to us is the most influential factor in maximizing long-term creative output, positive emotions, and motivation. The problem is, for some of us, focusing on what’s next (for example: our to-do lists) means we skate right past our wins , no matter how big or small they are. How do we train ourselves, over time, to notice progress? We already keep a to-do list. Why not add a done list? A done list is a log of the tasks you’ve completed. Keeping a done list has the power to fortify your motivation, and heighten positive emotions like joy and pride. They can make creative productivity more sustainable by helping you experience a sense of progress for work that matters to you. Success leaves clues Renowned entrepreneur and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, cheekily calls it the “Anti To-Do List. ” For years, Google had a process called “ Snippets ,” which caught fire at companies like FourSquare, Buzzfeed and Shopify . Snippets is the process companies use to gather what employees have accomplished and are working on, typically on a weekly basis. They them make that information internally public so any team member can see what’s happening in other departments. In the case of FourSquare, employees even provide feedback to CEO Dennis Crowley on his Snippets. All of these systems refer to the process of reflecting and writing down what you’ve done. Creating a list of done items has the almost magical effect of amplifying motivation and productivity at tasks that matter. How amazing would it feel to end each day focusing on your accomplishments, rather than the never-ending mountain of tasks waiting for you come morning? When we reflect on progress, we practically metabolize it. Jot down completed tasks, and view them as “wins,” or progress towards your final goal(s), and you can externalize and recognize them. ” Writing, like speaking, requires translating thoughts into words, which externalizes those thoughts and allows us to see them for what they are so we can move forward. Clarity affords possibility. In the process of reviewing and writing down our work, we also often unearth learnings that went unnoticed in real time. Hindsight is 20/20. Looking in retrospect at a completed project allows us to see it within a larger context. We can quickly and more accurately analyze why particular aspects were challenging and the ways in which we succeeded, then apply that awareness to future tasks. For example, if you felt you had a stressful week, you might make this list and notice that your attention was split between too many projects. In the following weeks, you could use new-found knowledge that awareness to reverse-engineer your days to focus on one major project at a time. Let momentum do part of the work If you’re planning strategically, meaning you’ve laid out the items on your to-do list comprehensively to achieve particular ends, accomplishing a discrete task or set of related tasks is a “win.” Researchers have long noted the particular power of the small win , which organizational psychologist Karl Weick defines as “a concrete, complete, implemented outcome of moderate importance.” Weick shows that small wins have power beyond themselves. “Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win,” Weick explained. “When a solution is put in place, the next solvable problem often becomes more visible.” If reflecting on our wins makes them seem more “real,” and small wins help generate more and often larger wins, the least we can do is write down our accomplishments, right? The link between wins, emotion, and motivation Wins also heighten positive emotions and intrinsic motivation , which result in more creative productivity. In The Progress Principle , psychologists Teresa Amabile and Steven J. Kramer analyzed  over 12,000 journal entries written by 238 company employees. They discovered that on days when employees experienced progress, they reported positive emotions like joy and pride. We’re more productive when we’re happy . In other words, positive emotion is a win for everyone. In their research, Amabile and Kramer discovered something fascinating: contrary to the commonly held belief that negative pressure creates better performance, on “progress days,” people were more intrinsically motivated. In other words, on days when employees felt progress and the positive emotions that come with that, they were more inspired to work based on interest in the work itself rather than by extrinsic sources like praise and encouragement. On “setback days,” though, people were both less intrinsically and extrinsically motivated. Given that we can’t always control external sources of motivation, like recognition from our boss, family and peers, drawing from our internal well of motivation by recognizing wins is a success strategy. The done list means that we can create motivation no matter where we find ourselves or what’s happening around us. How to implement done list psychology Keeping a done list in addition to your to-do list is a quick and simple way to increase success and well-being. How do you create these lists in a way that fits your needs? Here are some approaches to try: Every Friday, set aside 10 minutes to jot down your wins for the week. If it’s helpful and relevant, after each task you complete, write any learnings or changes you’d like to implement in the future. Research suggests that handwriting activates different, critical areas of the brain than typing. Keep a done list for each project you work on. This can help you experience a sense of progress at a discrete goal, especially one that feels hairy or overwhelming. Encourage any teams you manage or work with to periodically discuss progress. This could mean starting meetings by having each team member share their recent wins – what they’ve done – or asking people to email their points of progress to their relevant managers. How do you recognize your progress for maximum results? Share your thoughts in the comments below.", "date": "2017-04-12,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Four Ways Virtual Teams Fail (and How to Fix Them)", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/four-ways-virtual-teams-fail/", "abstract": "A scene from an average company, circa 2017: Sandra, a business analyst, comes into the office at 9:00 in the morning, sits down at her desk and checks her email. She finds a note from Paolo, who works in another country and was hard at work while Sandra was asleep. She forwards an attachment with a few questions to Vera, who works in a satellite office down the street, and then hops onto a call with a contractor based in a distant city. Before she’s finished her first cup of coffee, Sandra has interacted with three teammates, but none of those interactions were face-to-face. Sound familiar? As technology reshapes the nature of our work, it is also reshaping the nature of our teams. The rise of virtual, distributed teams has liberated businesses to hire the best people for the job no matter where they are, saving time and money. But there’s also a downside: challenges in communication can leave virtual teams feeling frustrated and adrift. New team, new rules “Research shows that two-thirds of experienced managers fail in their first attempt to run a virtual team,” says Beat Bühlmann, Evernote’s General Manager for EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa). “For new managers, the failure rate is even higher.” Beat has studied the factors that make virtual teams succeed or fail for the past 16 years. After making it the basis of his doctoral dissertation (later converted to a book ), Beat put his research to work at top companies like HP, Google, and Dell before taking charge of Evernote’s office in Zürich, Switzerland. Beat explains that failure among virtual teams usually comes down to one thing: “They try to apply the same rules that worked face-to-face. They don’t think about what’s different in the virtual team setting.” Beat Bühlmann For a virtual team to function, all the parts must work well together. “Half of the team cannot win,” says Beat. “Either the full team wins, or the full team loses.” Is your virtual team set up for success? Here are four indicators that you might be going the wrong way. Pitfall 1: Lack of understanding We tend to think of virtual teams as separated by geography, but people are also separated by time zone, language, culture, religion, and other factors. They might be on a different floor or the other side of the globe. They may even have different missions. “It’s a continuum, not black and white,” says Beat, emphasizing that no two teams are alike . “Your team might be only slightly virtual or entirely virtual, and you need to account for the particular situation.” For example, you may unconsciously assume that everyone’s work day is like your own. The more distributed your team, the less likely that will be the case. Teammates in separate offices may have different responsibilities, commitments, constraints, or restrictions. They may be subject to different employment laws or have different holidays and vacation policies. Those offices also have distinct infrastructures, events, and methods of working. “One of the biggest mistakes virtual managers make is assuming every office is like their own,” says Beat. “They’re not.” Solution: Learn the culture “Make sure you know the local situation and environment of each member of your team,” including cultural norms and religious obligations. If you have a teammate in another country, learn the etiquette for working in that country (Beat recommends the Executive Planet Guide and Swissôtel Etiquette Map as good places to start). Talk to your company’s Human Resources team to get familiar with applicable laws, policies, or standards. Create a notebook in Evernote where all this information is saved and shared for easy reference. And most important of all, talk to your teammates, so you know if their needs and your team’s needs align. Bottom line: Virtual teams are diverse teams. Learn to accommodate the differences, and you’ll be better able to take advantage of the unique perspectives and fresh ideas that come from that diversity. Pitfall 2: Poor communication As anyone who’s survived a Facebook or Twitter argument knows, nuances of meaning can vanish in text-based messages. That’s because a lot of human communication is nonverbal. When we speak face-to-face, we pick up meaning from visual cues like facial expression or body language, or paralinguistic cues like loudness or hesitation. Misunderstandings are 5x as likely to happen when we move away from face-to-face conversations. Without those nonverbal hints, we lose context that can help us interpret a statement. You may be making a joke, but your use of sarcasm or irony doesn’t reach the other person, only the words do. According to Beat, misunderstandings become five times as likely to happen when we move away from face-to-face conversations. Misunderstandings are even more likely when the people in a conversation have different native languages. “Non-native English speakers tend to overrate their English skills,” Beat says. And it’s easy to forget that not everyone may understand your slang or pop-culture references. Of all the methods of communication, emails are the most prone to error. We tend to pour a lot of information into long, dense emails, and because the conversation is asynchronous, we may have no opportunity to clarify or correct ourselves. We can’t even be sure the message was read, much less understood. “If people are too busy, they’re not going to bother. You may have sent the message, but that doesn’t mean they read it,” Beat says. Responses don’t always help clarify the situation: if someone replies to your email with a “yes” answer, does that indicate enthusiasm or grudging acceptance? Did they understand the details? Are they agreeing to take the next step or only agreeing with your idea? Solution: Be crystal clear When working with a virtual team, remember that people have different means of expressing themselves and may not always understand you. Slow down when speaking, and avoid jargon or obscure words. If you’re sometimes misunderstood by your own family and friends online, imagine how difficult it is for a teammate in another country. In an email, Beat recommends getting straight to the point and keeping it short. “You should never have to scroll in an email,” he says. “If you have to scroll, it’s not clear enough. You would be better off with a phone call or meeting.” When it comes to requests and commitments, Beat advocates a method he calls “the 3 W’s.” Every communication should be clear about: WHO does WHAT by WHEN Review your recent emails, chats, and meeting notes. Are action items clear on all 3 Ws? If not, you’ve identified a quick way to improve team communication. And in true international style, Beat points out that the same rule works in German (wer/was/wann) and French (qui/quoi/quand) as well. Bottom line: Take extra care in your communications, especially if your teammates can’t see your face and body language, and ask questions when something isn’t clear. These steps will save you headaches down the line. Pitfall 3: Using the wrong channels The problems with email illustrate a bigger issue: virtual teams don’t always choose their communication channels wisely, and this can harm trust. “There are two kinds of trust,” says Beat, “interpersonal and task-based.” Interpersonal trust comes from shared experiences and interests, and the fastest way to develop that is through face-to-face interaction. “So in a new virtual team, it’s important for everybody to meet in person as early as possible and agree on how they will work together.” The money spent on travel will be made up in the long term through a more cohesive team. “If your house is burning, do you email the fire department?” Task-based trust comes from cooperative behavior, keeping commitments and deadlines, and delivering quality work. That’s easier when teams choose the right ways to communicate. “If your house is burning, do you email the fire department? That would be a bad idea.” Deciding as a team which communications should happen via video conference, phone calls, chat, or email can go a long way toward building cooperation, meeting deadlines, and creating the trust your organization needs to succeed. Solution: Write a team charter for communication When Beat joined Evernote, he and his entire team collaborated on a “team charter” that laid out rules, responsibilities, and no-go areas for communication. Every team will have different needs based on their unique situation, but examples of what might go into a charter include: A preference order for communication channels: call if possible, then chat, then email For teams using Evernote Business, standards for shared notebooks, note titles, and tags No checking of email after 8 PM No “Blind CCs” in email conversation Reply “yes” or “no” to all calendar invitations No multitasking or side conversations in meetings All action items include the 3 Ws Exceptions: what counts as an emergency and which rules can you suspend? When the team has reached consensus, everyone signs the charter, which is then printed out and posted. New hires are also expected to sign. Bottom line: Agree as a team how you want to work together. Get everyone on the same page and set clear expectations that can be used to build trust. Pitfall 4: Hiring the wrong people Unfortunately, none of the above tips will be enough if you don’t have the right people on your team. “Team members are interdependent. That’s part of the definition of a team,” says Beat. “But most companies go through the same process for hiring a virtual team member as when they hire locally. They don’t check to see if the candidate will be a good virtual team member, and that’s why there’s so much turnover.” It’s not simply a matter of finding someone with the raw qualifications for the job. An employee may be brilliant in a face-to-face meeting and still lack the skills to succeed in a virtual setting. Without the benefit of direct interaction and feedback, Beat says that the ability to listen is paramount. “I always include an interview stage where I ask some simple questions by phone, then ask the candidate to reply by email. All they have to do is repeat the questions and answer each one in two or three sentences. Most people fail this test. They fail because they didn’t listen to the instructions . If they don’t listen, there’s no way they can succeed in a virtual team.” Solution: Test for listening and communication skills In the interview process, make sure you’re talking to candidates the same way you’ll talk to them on the job. That means conducting interview stages in person, by phone, on video, and via email. Each medium gives you a chance to assess different parts of a person’s skill set. Is he or she a good listener? Does he communicate clearly? Does she ask for clarification? Does this person understand the challenges of working with others who are separated by time, space, and culture, and are you confident they can meet those challenges? If not, this person may not be the right fit for your team. Bottom line: Virtual teams can only succeed when all the members are working together. That means hiring people who are good listeners, good communicators, and good collaborators.", "date": "2017-04-13,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Practical Uses of Emojis", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/practical-uses-of-emojis/", "abstract": "Emojis are everywhere. You may think they make your communication look juvenile, but actually, they’re not kid stuff at all. Emojis have a rich history, serve a practical role in modern written communication, and are becoming part of the fabric of modern global society. When online communications were new, the Internet was a wild frontier, and nobody, literally nobody, knew how to use it. People got unreasonably upset over perceived slights, “flame wars” started at the slightest provocation (“flaming” was the term for hurling online insults at people), and budding friendships ended. Nothing was as common as misunderstandings between people that stemmed from being set free on a medium with no rules. Email and chat couldn’t convey intention, emotion, subtlety, or cleverness. Without context, humans did what we humans do best: we filled in the blanks. More often than not, it led to communication disaster. It became obvious that the Internet lacked key elements to human interaction: faces and voices. Of course, old-fashioned letter-writing had the same limitation; the difference was, people rarely used letters for the kinds of casual conversation that had become commonplace online. Facing facts and truths Enter emojis. In 1982, long before the Internet was capable of supporting tiny graphics (or any graphics, for that matter), Scott Falhman made a humble suggestion to other users on a message board for computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon University. “I propose the following character sequence for joke markers: ‘ :-) ’” he wrote. Then, sagely, he added, “Read it sideways.” The simple character sequence was called an emoticon, and it changed everything.  Emoticons were limited, but they did a big job: they provided emotional context to a statement (“Do you know how to use the Internet?” :-) ) and could serve to diffuse a statement that might be taken the wrong way. (“I won’t be there tonight.” :-( ) Emoticons were a good start, but more was needed. As humans, we need to interact with faces. In fact, studies have shown that over 60 percent of the way we perceive communication depends on nonverbal cues like body language and tone of voice. Without these elements, we attach meaning to other indicators in the communication. Capital letters are thought of as “shouting,” and even punctuation, or the lack of it, has hidden meaning. Even today, properly-punctuated text messages can be interpreted as being creepily enthusiastic or passive-aggressive. So when mobile social media and text messaging came on the scene, and people all over the world began communicating more frequently, and more casually than ever, something had to be done. A tiny history of emojis The answer came in the late 1990s when Shigetaka Kurita , an employee at NTT Docomo in Japan, designed a set of simple images to appeal to the teenage customers of its pager service. Inspired by both images from popular manga and Japanese characters, Kurita designed 176 original images that became as powerful a tool to written communication as the first pictograms millennia ago. He called these images “emoji,” a combination of the Japanese words for “picture” (e) and “character. (moji). In doing so, Kurita created a universal language, one that crossed verbal and written language barriers, added emotional context to words, and even gave us the faces that people naturally crave. The invention that started on teenagers’ pagers quickly spread onto global smartphones, into social media, and became a cultural phenomenon. Official emojis are now governed by a non-profit organization called the Unicode Consortium, and there are currently 1,851 emojis recognized by them, with 69 more coming in June, including fantasy characters like genies, zombies, wizards, witches, and fairies. It’s not possible to create your own emojis, though many online apps have custom emoji-like stickers, and platforms like Slack support users creating tiny reaction images. As with any language, emojis were quickly politicized, and, as a result, Unicode sets standards intended for inclusion and diversity, such as variable skin tones and gender neutrality. A picture really is worth 1000 words Wizards and witches?  Dinosaurs? Socks, soup, and flying saucers? How are these emojis practical for clarifying communication? What’s happening here? A study from Instagram suggests that emojis are evolving into a discrete language as people combine individual emojis to make unique messages. Source The Instagram study also suggests that emojis are replacing alphabet-based Internet slang altogether, such as ? replacing “LOL” and ? taking the place of the ubiquitous “OMG.” There is evidence to suggest that emojis are standing in for the actual words and are breaking down worldwide language barriers as most (but not all) emojis have similar global interpretation. As the old saying goes, a smile is a smile in any language. So if emojis can clarify written language, instill global understanding, and even replace words themselves, what else might they be able to do? Here at Evernote, we suggest: Use emojis to title notes or notebooks—if not the whole title, then the beginning or end of one. Emojis give you instant recognition for what the contents might be about. Note or notebook titles that begin with emoji will also be grouped together (generally at the top of the list) when you sort alphabetically. Try using a marker like ➡️  to indicate the current step different teammates are working on to keep track of the progress of a project. Use ✅  in addition to Evernote’s built-in checkboxes for a clear indicator that something is done, or ?  to call attention to a due date. This is the one place you can choose any emoji to mean anything you want. Just be sure to specific emojis consistently, so that the meaning of each emoji is the same to everyone reading the note. To be even clearer, create a legend so that all participants use the same emojis. Tip: Use an emoji as a digital tattoo in your profile name to promote your personal brand in your favorite chat app. Are we forgetting how to read? One might wonder if emojis might someday replace the written word altogether (and if you’re not uncomfortable yet, here’s Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet told entirely in emojis ). We might forget how to use written language if emojis continues to evolve, some worry. Forgetting how to read is not as concerning as what happened to the ancient Egyptians. Their highly advanced written language, which was also pictogram-based, was entirely forgotten for four thousand years. Anybody who visited archeological sites and tombs could see the writing on the wall, but nobody could read it. The Rosetta Stone was found in 1799, delivering the same message in three languages—Greek, demotic Coptic, and Egyptian. It took another 23 years, but it was the existing alphabet-based languages that eventually unlocked the the mystery of the strange hieroglyphics. It turned out that each glyph represented a sound, so deciphering the Egyptian message was a matter of cryptography. Future linguists will have a harder time with emojis. They represent ideas, emotions, and cultural references which will have long since disappeared. What will they make of a symbol like an open hand?   (?️ ) Does it represent the number five? A wave? “Talk to the hand?” “Stop”? What kind of Rosetta Stone will help interpret the meaning of ? ? Some people see it as an ironic grin, and others think it’s a painful grimace . People have conflicting interpretations of certain emojis, and the problem is compounded by the fact that the pictures themselves are not standardized across platforms. So the emoji you send to a friend from your iPhone might be received on a Samsung or Android device as something different altogether. Source These examples alone indicate that written language is in no danger. Like Egyptian hieroglyphs, emojis are probably set in stone, but they will never completely replace the richness of the written word.", "date": "2017-04-17,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Find Critical Data Quickly with Evernote and Launchcloud", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/find-critical-data-quickly-with-launchcloud/", "abstract": "As a business owner, have you ever wanted a way to quickly find customer feedback, survey results, intake forms, and other data with Evernote? Try Launchcloud, an app that integrates with Evernote that makes finding and managing data in Evernote even easier. What is Launchcloud? Launchcloud is a paperless information-gathering and automation platform that allows you to collect information like sales lead data, documents, orders, and surveys by using pre-made online forms. With Launchcloud, you can either create drag and drop forms to customize the information fields you need, or you can use Launchcloud’s form templates for more common uses. Launchcloud is designed for companies who want to automate sales, marketing, information gathering, and data collection processes. You can use it in the office, in the field, on iOS and Android, and both online and offline. For example, if your sales employees gather leads in the field, they can use Launchcloud’s forms to more easily gather customers’ names, contact, and other data using mobile devices. You can also share and embed Launchcloud forms from your website, email, and social media to receive consent forms, NDAs, customer feedback, and any other information you want to store digitally. “Launchcloud is quick and simple to set up,” says London-based Launchcloud’s CEO and co-founder, Matt Doyle. “It’s a one-click install to authorize your Evernote account, and then you can connect that to a form and instantly be able to see insight behind the structured information that’s being collected from multiple people.” Using Launchcloud with Evernote “Anyone who has a structure to the way they sell, or get customer feedback or insights, can benefit from working in Launchcloud and Evernote,” says Doyle. Launchcloud with Evernote integration works two ways: you can either “push” data to Evernote, or “pull” it from existing data in Evernote. Though Evernote does not integrate directly with Excel spreadsheets, communication between Evernote and Excel is possible using Launchcloud forms. Attach a spreadsheet to a Launchcloud form in Evernote, and Launchcloud can read the data in the spreadsheet and automatically populate the form. Want to go the other way and put form data into a spreadsheet? That’s no problem for Launchcloud. Launchcloud can “push” information from a form, like a customer survey or intake form, into an Evernote note. For example, when customers fill out intake forms using  Launchcloud, it’s easy for you to push the data into an Evernote notebook called “Intakes” and store the results of each form in a single note. From there, you’ll be able to quickly find the customers’ information again in Evernote. Evernote with Launchcloud lets team members access information using Evernote’s powerful search capabilities. If you need to review how customers responded to a survey, for example, Evernote’s search functionality lets you search by any word in a note, notebook, location, or tag. How to get started In the Evernote App Center, locate Launchcloud and create an account. With a Standard, Pro or Enterprise Launchcloud account, you can integrate with any version of Evernote. With so many apps to help make business easier, it’s ironic that sometimes having too many apps can slow down productivity. Launchcloud provides a way to gather, find, and make sense of data using the software you already know and love.", "date": "2017-04-25,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Francesco D’Alessio on Productivity for the Real World", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/francesco-dalessio-on-productivity/", "abstract": "Chances are good you’ve already met Francesco D’Alessio. On his YouTube channel , Francesco takes viewers through both basic and advanced Evernote tips and tricks in short, 6-12 minute chunks. Recently, Evernote’s Director of Global Community and Training Joshua Zerkel caught up with Francesco in London for a Facebook Live event to discuss personal and busines productivity. Francesco found Evernote on his iPod Touch when he was only 15 years old, and thought “this is awesome.” Inspired, he read Getting Things Done , and started to use the book’s principles of time management for school right away. “I tried to avoid keeping stuff in my head. I noticed school work was getting easier.” Initially, he used Evernote only for school, but now calls it his “hub.” Now a college graduate, Francesco is also an Evernote Certified Leader with virtual customers all over the world. Adding structure to an unstructured work life “I have a non-traditional work life,” Francesco explained. “That means I work from home, or a cafe, or anywhere—just not in a traditional office.” He helps small businesses—mostly startups—increase productivity. “I’m able to manage it quite well,” he told Josh. “I have a structured routine. I work with Asian companies in the morning, and then with US companies in the afternoon.” His choice of venue is also dictated by the type of work he’s doing. “Cafes can be a distraction,” he told Josh, “but if I’m doing light stuff like administrative work, I can do that in a cafe. Things that take five to ten minutes are perfect for cafes. But if I’m working on content or other deep work, and I need things to be soundproof, then I do that at home.” Working alone and remotely with global teams requires a strategy to stay productive. Francesco realizes that we have different energy levels throughout the day, so he bases his schedule on these varying levels. He has these levels divided into proactive, active, and inactive, states. When his energy level is high, his work is proactive. When he’s at home doing deep work, he said that he tries to eliminate his phone. “I put it on the other side of the room, turn notifications off all day,” he said. Francesco also turns off social media notifications so he’s not disturbed. That’s what he calls an inactive state. When he’s working on a project with others, he’s active. Tagging all his work by these energy states helps him stay focused, and he can quickly match his workload to his mood. Pro Tip: Use Evernote tags to classify your work according to the levels of energy and attention they will take. Then, do the work that matches your energy levels throughout the day. Organizing work and life inside Evernote To stay organized with his clients and business projects, he keeps just four core stacks, which he’s labeled Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. “When future stuff comes into my head, I have a separate notebook I call Inbox. Anything I want to store for later I can just save to the Inbox. That’s a great way for email, too,” he added. “When there are emails I want to save, I just forward them to the inbox. It can be your clearinghouse, and then you can sort it later.” Sorting all that incoming material is a job for an app that integrates with Evernote, Todoist, says Francesco. Though it’s possible to sort your inbox without it, Francesco prefers to connect the two apps. “Inside Todoist, I have a reminder to clear my Evernote inbox,” Francesco told Josh.  “When that comes up, I clear it by filing (each item I’ve saved) in the right location. If there’s an action I need to get to right away, I put that in ToDoist. If there’s something in there that I need a reminder for, I’ll put it in Evernote, and the reminder will pop up.” Francesco is a fan of Web Clipper and regularly clips five to ten pieces a day. Using his ToDoist method, filing all of those clips takes only a few minutes. Pro Tip: Keep a notebook called “Inbox” at the top of your Evernote shortcuts. Once a week, go into your inbox and sort the items into their appropriate folders for easy organization. You don’t need a separate task manager to do this, but some people find it helpful. Keeping business teams on the same page One of the things Francesco does for his business clients is to help them organize teams. He recommends using Evernote’s integration with Google Drive to share documents. “Small businesses want to grow, so being organized is important,” Francesco said. “In college, we didn’t have hours and hours to try and find things, so we just made this hub of data that we could just mine when we needed it.” He applies the same principles to business. “Sometimes the same information is in multiple places, and nobody can find anything,” he explained. “If your team is putting longer documents like spreadsheets from Google Drive into Evernote, anyone on the team can find them from anywhere.” Pro Tip: Add Google Drive links to your notes. Create documents, presentations, and spreadsheets in Google Drive, and save the link, along with any pertinent notes or ideas, in Evernote. Your Google Drive materials will be much easier for everyone on the team to find. Evernote as a calendar Despite being an Evernote expert, Francesco is still learning new capabilities. Recently, he discovered how to keep a calendar inside Evernote, and he made a YouTube video to share his learning. “I made this using tables,” Francesco says. “I made four rows, and I use the tab to extend it. It’s not too complicated. If you’re managing a lot of projects, it can be a lifesaver.” For example, Francesco’s content calendar contains the date, the piece of content he wants to create (such as a video) the title, the status, and notes about it. “I can just scroll up and see everything that’s coming in advance,” Francesco concluded. Anyone on a business team can see it, too, helping to keep team members connected with deadlines, and each other. Pro Tip: For key notebooks that you’ll use everywhere, such as a calendar, make them available offline. You’ll be able to create and see notifications and notebooks even when you travel. The elephant in the room: work/life balance In transitioning from a student to a worker, Francesco has experienced first-hand what many workers have known for years: trying to achieve work/life balance is nearly impossible. The concept of a work/life blend is more appropriate for Francesco at this point in his life, and he notes that many of today’s workers are adopting the same approach to keep a healthy balance in this age of always-on technology and information input. Since only healthy teams can be productive, this is an area Francesco is working on—for both his clients and for himself. “I met some founders of companies in Barcelona, and they were saying the same thing,” Francesco mused. “As a young person who has just come out of university, I have to keep going to get where I need to get. I haven’t been good at clocking out. The book The Danish Art of Living Well helps, and I’ve started to meditate. My clarity has cleared up massively,” he said. Though it’s a bit of a paradox to use apps to help free yourself from technology and find your true self, it’s true that we are part of a world that can no longer function without them. Apps that help you do more, think more clearly, and organize your work and life help you free up time to achieve more of that elusive blend between work and life. Francesco D’Alessio has made doing this for himself and others his life’s work—and his pleasure. As an Evernote user, you’re part of a global community.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Passing Notes—A Better Way to Share Content From Conferences", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/passing-notes-share-content-from-conferences/", "abstract": "How long do you think you can remember the content of a keynote or a speech after you’ve heard it? Aren’t there times when you wish you would have remembered a particular fact or quote from a speaker? While there are those lucky few who never seem to forget a thing, the majority of us are stuck with average retention skills. In fact, it may surprise you to learn that we forget over half the things we learn within a matter of days. Yet we often spend thousands to attend professional conferences, and we take in a lot of information to remember—and promptly forget. It may sound obvious, but taking notes at conference sessions is a great remedy for this problem. Set up a notebook in Evernote for an event you’re attending or organizing, and create a note for each keynote speech or panel discussion. Take live notes at the sessions, and you’ll have a notebook full of valuable insight that you can share or set aside for later. Keeping an event notebook is a great idea for three simple reasons: Notes are short Look around and you’ll find videos of keynote addresses and other speeches, but who has the time to watch them? It takes less time to digest a note summary than it does to flip through an entire PowerPoint, or sit through a video. Plus, you can always add PDF versions of presentations or links to videos in Evernote. 2. Notes stay with you Why trust your short-term memory? When you write it down, what you capture stays with you—ready for whenever you need it. 3. Notes are shareable If you’re attending a conference, share your takeaways with other attendees—or with co-workers who weren’t able to go. If you’re an event organizer, share notes with your guests as part of a “digital goody bag”—they’re sure to appreciate it. Evernote often serves as the “official note-taker” at major events, as we did with SXSW a few months ago. Create a new notebook in Evernote. In Evernote’s notebook view, right click on the notebook you’ve just created to open the drop-down menu, and then select Publish notebook. Set the name of your notebook’s public URL. When an Evernote notebook is published as a link, you’ll get a public URL that can then be shared with anyone. Unlike personal notebooks where you need to set reading permissions, anyone who has the public URL can view the contents of that notebook. Learn more about how to share personal notebooks as links (URLS) » Tip: Make your public URL trackable and see how many people viewed your notebook. Shorten the URL with bit.ly to use on social media. Create an agenda and an intro note Once you’ve set up your notebook, it’s time to fill it with notes from the sessions you attend. Consider making notebook navigation easier by creating a Table of Contents note. If you set up your notebook so that each session has its own note, you’ll be able to recreate the conference agenda in just one or two clicks. Add the event line-up of speeches and panel discussions and insert links to each individual note. Want to make your conference notebook even more enticing to your readers? Create an introductory note to welcome them and walk them through how to use the notebook. Take a look at this note to see an example of an introduction. Get started with this note summary template Now that you’ve set up the basis for your notebook, set up notes for all the keynotes and sessions you plan to attend. Setting up your notes means you’ll make sure that all the notes from each session have a consistent look. Take a look at our example note summary for some inspiration. There are several things to keep in mind when setting up your notes: Give each session a title: Use a consistent structure for your note titles and stick to it. This will make it easier for your viewers to navigate through the notebook. Create a public link: You can also share each note summary individually. Learn more about how to create public links for individual notes. Set expectations: If you’re taking notes live from an event or conference, be sure to mention it. Tell your audience to check back later for the final version if you need some time to revise your notes before they’re ready to be shared. Set up your public notes any way you like. Or, if you’d like some help, here’s a handy note summary template to get started. Get the template » Have you used Evernote at a conference you’ve organized or attended?

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "5 Favorite Ways to Collect Content in Evernote", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/5-ways-to-collect-content-in-evernote/", "abstract": "Just as the founders of Yahoo and Starbucks found inspiration for their company names from novels they’d read, we, too, often stumble upon our best ideas from the least expected places. The name “Yahoo,” for instance, was derived, in part, from a legendary creature found in Jonathan Swift’s novel, Gulliver’s Travels . And the name “Starbucks” was inspired by the chief mate on the whaling ship in Herman Melville’s novel, Moby-Dick . Had Evernote been around when the founders of Starbucks were brainstorming for names, they would’ve had an easy way to collect all their ideas into one place. When the founders came across the name “Starbo” on the old mining map they’d found, I could imagine them snapping and saving a photo of it into Evernote. A little while later, when they decided to search for words beginning with “st”, they would’ve seen the name “Starbuck” highlighted in a PDF version of Moby-Dick they’d saved to Evernote months earlier. Creative ideas, like start-up ventures, often start from humble beginnings. And only after they’re cultivated and given time to germinate, do they begin to sprout. If the founders had failed to make that crucial connection between the map and the novel, we’d be drinking coffee from “Cargo House” (the name they came close to adopting). Whether you’re starting a new coffee shop or redesigning your company website, Evernote serves as a great incubator for ideas and has a considerably large capacity to collect and retain information. Here are five ways Evernote can help you collect and save content: 1. Web Clipper Web Clipper lets you capture full-page articles, along with the images, text, and page layouts as they appear in your browser. Download and install Evernote Web Clipper as an extension for your web browser. Learn more » Try it out: Search the web for your favorite coffee-related words, then, highlight and save words or phrases you like to Evernote. 2. App integrations Evernote works well with many of the productivity, photography, or lifestyle apps you already use. Use applications such as IFTTT or Zapier to extend the power of Evernote by automating connections with other online services. Learn more » Try it out: Create a recipe in IFTTT or a Zap automation in Zapier that sends you a Slack notification whenever your partner creates a new note with more name ideas. 3. Add photos and images to notes Use the Evernote camera on your mobile device to snap a photo or use it as a handy, portable scanner. You can also attach image files from your computer to any note. Evernote can search handwritten or printed text inside images saved to your account. Learn more » Try it out: Snap photos of the company names you and your partners scribbled onto a whiteboard (or on the back of an envelope) during your last brainstorming session so you don’t have to spend time typing them all out. 4. Drag and drop Got documents and files on your computer you’d like to save to Evernote? Simply drag and drop them directly from your computer into a note. Each file is saved as a separate note. You can also attach files to any opened note. Learn more: Mac | Windows Try it out: Attach PDFs, Office files, or anything else you’ve collected from your desktop computer to notes in Evernote. 5. Save emails to Evernote Save travel reservations, meeting notes, or other emails to Evernote. These notes can be organized into notebooks alongside other notes related to the same topic.

He has been with the company since March of 2015, working originally in our Zürich office and recently relocating to our Redwood City headquarters. How did you end up at Evernote? I was living in Germany, but I wanted to work for a Silicon Valley company. I decided to join Evernote because the people I met in the interview process were amazing. The technical excellence I saw from them was top notch and it convinced me this was the place to be. What is the biggest technical challenge you’re solving right now? The backend systems that serve all Evernote clients are a monolith, which makes code changes riskier. Releasing changes requires coordination across multiple teams, which is a lot of effort. In order to solve this problem, we are currently writing new code that will run on a microservices platform. We are also planning to gradually break down the monolith into smaller services. Our current architecture is very stable and mature, but it hasn’t changed in a while. Anirban Kundu, our CTO, has encouraged the engineers to have ownership in pushing new ideas and making things happen. We can pick technologies we want to use on projects without worrying that those decisions will be blocked by managers. That sounds refreshing. A lot of other companies have a big distance between the engineers and the CTO but that’s not the case here. It feels like everyone is equal and this goes all the way up to the CTO. Anirban sits in on meetings as if he is one of us; it doesn’t feel like, “oh my god, this is the CTO and we have to be careful of what we say.” He and the other managers and leaders feel like peers because they treat everyone the same. What I value most is the human component here. This isn’t the sort of place where people want to be the alpha or they have huge egos and want to be better than everyone else. I like that. So how do the technical teams work at Evernote? There are two kinds of teams: Specific codebases like Android, iOS, backend, etc. each have teams who are responsible for maintaining their part of the code. That doesn’t mean other teams don’t contribute, but this is your permanent team. Depending on the project, you may form cross-functional teams with other people. For example, as part of Evernote’s cloud migration I’m working with Ops, QA, and other engineering teams who I wouldn’t work with otherwise. It makes sense to loop in people with the technical expertise on a particular subject that your regular team may be lacking. How long these cross-functional teams last varies depending on the scope of the project. Is the work fun? For sure. We do a lot of interesting and new things. We have small, lean engineering teams with a lot of ambition so you can’t avoid learning new things as you go, no matter what your experience level is. I’ve had the chance to do exciting things here — specifically with Cloud technologies. It’s also fun because of the people. The atmosphere in the office is naturally comfortable and friendly. What is the most satisfying part of your job? There are many satisfying parts of my job, but the main one is being able to work together with others on hard problems. I like when we think through a solution on the board, code it up, roll it out into production, observe how it behaves, and iterate from there. You started out working remotely. How was that experience? I was a remote worker for one and a half years in Zürich and it was a superb experience. I never felt detached or out of the loop because the team naturally tried hard to keep me up to date. They would organize meetings across the time zones that I could attend. I do enjoy being in the office more but the remote experience was not isolating. People here don’t care as much if you work in the office, at your desk or from home. I get bored and demotivated when I have to sit for 8+ hours every day at the same desk. It’s a pleasure being able to walk around the office and socialize here and there, or drive home to San Francisco and work in a coffee shop. We don’t subscribe to the idea that productivity only comes from keeping your head down and coding day after day. What are three things you think someone considering working for Evernote should know? Evernote has small engineering teams so your footprint is very large. You will make an impact here. We have a large user base, a big system, and we work at high scale so everyone has a lot of responsibility. We’re migrating to the Cloud and taking advantage of new technologies. It’s an exciting time to join the company!", "date": "2017-01-6,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "11 Advanced Search Techniques to Quickly Find What You Need", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/11-advanced-search-techniques/", "abstract": "When you’re searching in Evernote, there are many different ways to go about whittling down the results. From simply typing into the box with the magnifying glass to more advanced search techniques such as using syntax, there’s a lot of options. While advanced search techniques may sound like a pretty intimidating topic that is somehow both mildly threatening and hopelessly out of reach, it’s really just a fancy way of saying there are lots of ways to step up your search game in Evernote. Unlock the power behind the search bar Why do we even need advanced search techniques? How hard can it be? Everyone knows about the most basic approach to search: typing into Evernote’s search bar and then scrolling through the results to find what you were looking for. Pretty obvious. But eventually, there will come a time when you are returning too many results for a simple search to handle. As you start to put more and more into Evernote, it can be harder to find what you need with plain old, regular searching. For example, if I type meeting notes into the search bar, my Evernote Business account returns precisely 4,144 results, which is a bit more than my “scroll and look” abilities can handle. Luckily, there’s more to this little search box than meets the eye. Underneath the hood are some powerful tools, such as advanced search syntax, application shortcuts, and more. Advanced search tips for the less advanced Advanced search is really just about speaking to the technology powering Evernote in a tongue that it understands. You can dive into advanced search syntax in Evernote with this help article to master all the search terms we have or check out this video for a quick primer. To make life even easier, we’ve rounded up some of our favorite advanced search methods here so you can just grab and go. (That way you can save the somewhat formidable task of learning search syntax and memorizing shortcuts for your future self.) 1. Take a shortcut To start things off easy, try your hand at some powerful search keyboard shortcuts. Quickly access the search bar in Evernote by using Option + Cmd + F for Mac or Ctrl + Q for Windows. To search specifically within the note you currently have open, use Ctrl + F in Windows and Cmd + F for Mac. As long as Evernote is running in the background, using Win + Shift + F in Windows and Ctrl + Cmd + E in Mac will immediately take you to our search bar. No matter whether you’re working in your browser or in iTunes, you can always get straight to the search by jumping directly into Evernote. Need a specific note, notebook, or tag in a pinch? Use Cmd + J with Evernote for Mac or Ctrl + Q for Windows to “jump” there, fast. You can see your most recent notebooks or just search for other things in general. Try it out—you’ll quickly see why this shortcut is a favorite. 2.  Cut straight to the notebook If you’re team notebooks in the ongoing battle between notebooks and tags] then you probably have a lot of them and it may take you a while to navigate to the exact one you are looking for. Find things in a specific notebook by typing notebook:insert notebook name into the search bar. Be sure not to include a space between the colon and the name of your notebook. (I may or may not be speaking from experience). 3.  The power of any If you type meeting notes into the search bar, Evernote will only show the notes that include all of your search keywords (i.e. meeting and notes both have to appear in the note for it to be included). But what if the note you are looking for is titled team sync notes or brainstorming session notes ? You’d be out of luck. Put any: before your search term. For example, any: meeting notes will show you every note that contains either meeting or notes . 4.  Exclude away Not everything needs to be included. I’m more of a notebook person myself, but if you’re an avid tagger, then this tip is especially helpful. Search for notes not tagged by using -tag. For example, if you’re looking for a receipt you haven’t submitted (and you’re diligent about using the proper tags), you can type -tag:submitted into the search bar to find receipts without the submitted tag. Use -tag:* to return all notes without tags. If sorting notes with tags is your thing, then this is a great way to see all the notes that you haven’t dealt with. 5.  Describe and go If you’re using Evernote in English on Mac, then you should definitely know about descriptive search . Use simple words to find things fast. If you clipped a great article last month but can’t remember where you put it, simply type in web clips last month and the Evernote search bar will do the work for you. To find that PDF you’re looking for, enter notes with PDFs into the search bar. See all the notes you created on your business trip to Germany by searching for notes from Germany . 6.  Check your progress Planners and list makers, this one’s for you. Searching your notes by checkboxes is a game changer. Search todo:false to view all of your notes with incomplete to-dos, an easy way to see what remains on your various task lists. Type todo:true to see what you’ve accomplished recently. Use todo:* to unveil all notes with checkboxes, checked off or not. 7.  Head straight to the source We all remember things in different ways. I tend to remember notes by the method I used to collect them. The conversation I have with myself when I’m on the hunt for something specific often goes something like this: “Where is that PDF? I know I forwarded it into Evernote from my email, but where did I put it …” If your mind works that way too, (with the talking to yourself bit included), then these tips are for you. Type source:mobile to see all the notes that were created from your phone. This is perfect for those times when you captured a great idea on your phone a few months ago, but then promptly forgot both the idea and where you put it in Evernote. Use source:mail.smtp to see notes added through email. This tip is great for when you remember forwarding an important email into your Evernote recently, but can’t find where you sent it. (Or in my case, sent it to the wrong notebook.) Try source:web.clip to see all the notes added via Web Clipper. 8.  Manage your search by media Adding attachments is part of what makes Evernote great. The ability to search for notes that contain specific kinds of media, from audio and images to PDFs, makes this nifty feature even better. Do a broad search by typing in resource:audio/* to see all notes with some kind of audio. Get more specific by searching resource:image/jpeg to find only JPEG image files. 9.  All in a day’s work Have you ever reached the end of the day only to think back, “ What did I actually even do today?” Author and going paperless expert Jamie Todd Rubin brings us a great tip for solving this problem. Type created:day into the search bar at the end of the day. That way, you can review what you worked on and make any changes to your to-do list for tomorrow. 10. Look at what you’ve accomplished We all put a lot into Evernote. Sometimes it’s fun to look back and see exactly just how much. What about using Evernote syntax like this: created:20080101 -created:20081231 and so on for each year? ?? — Vladimir Campos (@vladcampos) April 13, 2017 Type in created:20160101 -created20161231 to find out how many notes you created in Evernote in 2016. 11. Saved search to the rescue Now that you’ve been introduced to a few different ways to search, do you see yourself using any of these advanced techniques more than once? If so, you definitely need Saved Searches in your life. Create a saved search so you don’t have to refer back to this article or look it up again. Save even more time by adding saved searches to your shortcuts tab. (For example, you could save the todo:false search and add it to your shortcuts —that way you can quickly pop over and see what you still have on your to-do list at the end of every day.) Go forth and search In case you can’t tell, when you’ve got advanced search techniques by your side, the possibilities are endless. There are many more applications of these tips, so don’t be afraid to get in there, mix it up, and experiment to see what works best for your workflow.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Understanding the Evolution of Human Thought", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/understanding-the-evolution-of-human-thought/", "abstract": "How did they think? Were they self-aware? How did they interact with others? Did they have the capacity to be creative? Could they argue? Did they dream? Could they imagine? How did we get from there to modern times? They say dead men tell no tales. “It’s hard enough to tell what the cognitive abilities are of somebody who’s standing in front of you,” says Alison Brooks , an archaeologist at George Washington University. “So it’s really hard to tell for someone who’s been dead for half a million years or a quarter million years.” Evolution is the product of a slow, ever-changing process precipitated by a host of environmental factors. So we can almost certainly agree that the way we imagine, problem-solve, think, and create must be vastly different today than it was in the times of our paleolithic relatives. For centuries, our neanderthal cousins and homo sapiens remained two separate family lines shrouded in mystery — one based on limited technology (in the years before Darwin’s eponymous The Order of Species , scientists licked fossils to determine their origins) and archaic, wide-sweeping, sometimes pejorative judgments based on fossil findings and human remains. In other words, much of science then was based on assumptions and beliefs. Only recently has new research indicated that we share a lot more in common with these Neanderthals than we imagined. And, it’s precisely this research that puts a flashpoint in the discussion of what it is that truly makes us human. That’s coupled with a lot of research that extends beyond the world of anthropology, including a host of research areas including evolutionary biology, philosophy, and neuroscience. To understand the foundation of early man’s thinking, we need to start at one of the most confounding principles of human thought: the origins of human consciousness. That’s to say, when did we start being aware, creative and mindful? Timeline of Human Evolution The first of modern humans — the Homo Sapiens, arrived about 200,000 years ago. The genetic shift in the Homo Sapien brain is relatively recent in the pantheon of evolutionary history. But, there wasn’t a lightning bolt moment when humans emerged and started thinking consciously and rationally. Here are a few clues that helped scientists piece together the riddle of how, when, and why human beings began to think differently, and how it impacted our evolution: 150,000 years: Shells, some with complex geometric shapes and iconography, shows that humans thought about items around them for decoration or ornamentation. 140,000 years: The first evidence of long-distance trade — ochre and bead ornaments are passed relay style , from group to group. 110,000 years: Beads comprised of sea snail shells showed that early humans had started to create things that were designed to be seen. Scientists speculate that these shell beads, some of which may have been brought from very far, were the first time humans thought symbolically. The beads may also have been used to differentiate and identify where groups belonged. 50,000 years: Scientists believe this period is when humans take a leap forward. More rapidly than ever before, people start to show hallmarks that differentiate from their primate relatives—humans start to bury their dead in ritualistic ceremonies, and hunting shifts to complex and well-imagined techniques, including traps. 30,000 years: The oldest cave art has been connected to this period, and murals in France have been connected to the Stone Age artists. 18,000 years: Advances in stone tools have been directly tied to a species of early humans referred to as “hobbit people” in Indonesia. Research linked tools to the Homo Floresiensis by dating layers of ash and calcite on fossil findings. This group, one of the last of early humans before Homo Sapiens, may have used tools between 50,000 and 190,00 years ago. 10,000 years: Agricultural villages sprout up, and people begin domesticating animals, including dogs. 5,500 years: Humans start to advance metallurgy — smelting copper and tin and incorporating them in stone implements. 5,000 years: Earliest signs of writing emerge . According to Genevieve Von Petzinger , these clues have helped scientists identify and classify early humans’ modern thinking as it relates to the artifacts or processes they used: “Since we are looking for evidence of mental changes that took place within the soft tissue of the brain, we can’t identify them directly, but luckily there are other ways to gauge how our ancestors’ minds may have been developing. To this end, researchers have compiled a list of practices and artifact types that strongly hint that symbolic thought processes are at work. Evidence includes the selection and preparation of particular shades of ochre, burials with grave goods, personal ornamentation, and the creation of geometric or iconographic representations. If most or all of these elements are present, the chances are good that you’re dealing with fully modern humans.” When archaeologists discovered an abalone shell in a 2008 cave excavation in South Africa, it contained traces of a rust-colored paint. Early humans used paint, but this discovery showed something much more exciting. It revealed that more than 100,000 years ago, creators of the piece had to procure the ingredients and make the paint. The shell was a merely a vessel for storage. The discovery provided a depth of knowledge about human thinking far beyond the simple fact that they painted. It proved they were capable of advanced thinking and planning. In fact, it may be one of the earliest moments that showcase innovation. Despite the difficulty in scientists coming to an agreement about what makes human thought special, these discoveries are the foundation for the evolution of modern cognition. The remarkable fact is that all of us living today are the end product of an incredible story of success against all odds: Each of us carries DNA that stretches back in an unbroken line to the beginnings of humanity and beyond. — Genevieve Von Petzinger Writing Changed Everything The one thing that separates us from other mammals is our ability to construct and use language. Much of our understanding of early man and evolution is buried in the earth, scrawled on cave walls, and carved into rock tools. Yet, this riddle remains the source of intense, drawn-out scientific debates. Some scientists believe that early humans communicated verbally as early as 50,000 years ago and others think earlier human ancestors spoke two million years ago. In the absence of audio recorders and iPhones, the language of earlier versions of mankind became one of the bigger mysteries in the evolutionary tale. Some of the earliest known writing found in what is present-day Iran, a still undecipherable language printed on clay tablets, stretches back 5,000 years —a recent blip on the geologic radar. Everything before that can only be interpreted in the context of the absence of language and writing. What makes human thinking unique? Memory is one of the things that distinguishes creatures in the animal kingdom. Without memory, it would be difficult for species to evolve. There are three components to memory: Procedural – recalling connections to response and stimuli Semantic – remembering things that are not inherently present, and providing a creature to construct a visual, mental model of something. Episodic – Recalling individual events in the order which they happened. Humans are one of a few creatures on the planet to have an episodic memory, and it’s likely the reason why we as a species have been able to advance, learn from the past, and evolve at a rapid rate. While animals clearly have memory, it appears to be semantic—the ability to understand bits and pieces of the “who,” “what,” and “where.” But, what about our ability to move through memories like a movie—to go back and forth in time and call up events, people, and places? This form of memory—mental time travel—may be the just one critical component to human intelligence that is unsurpassed in the wild. The concept of our mind’s ability to move through time was hypothesized by Dr. Endel Tulving , who called it chronesthesia, an ability by humans, acquired through evolution, to be cognizant of the past as well as the future. For now, it seems to be unique to humans, but there has been recent research indicating that some birds share this unique mental trait. Dr. Tulving noted that this form of memory is necessary for evolution. While you can call up equations or facts with semantic thinking, or acquire experiences and memories with “episodic” thought, there’s no way to survive as a species without the ability to remember specific points from our past or to predict what might happen in the future based on experience. According to Tulving , recalling and replaying events in the past has helped us to evolve by allowing us to update critical information while continuing to deal with rapid changes and chaos in the world around us. Human Consciousness Michael Tomasello , head of a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, deals with analyzing how human thinking compares to that of our primate relatives. His findings have led to advances in our understanding of human evolution. His lab proved that of the three major components of consciousness (collective, individual, and joint), only individual intentionality—the ability to imagine an outcome as a reward, such as climbing a tree to grab food—is shared with apes. Putting the pieces together After thousands of years, we all share similar needs to eat and to procreate, but only modern humans have the innate ability to network. “We have a fundamental urge to link our minds together,” notes Thomas Suddendorf, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Queensland in Australia. The ability to network in turn creates a unique competitive advantage that places humans at the top of the chain. “This allows us to take advantage of the strengths of others,” he says. By doing so, we’ve been able to move from hunter-gatherers to a species that is predicated on its accumulation of knowledge and its ability to collaborate and build joint experiences, creations, and imaginations. Plenty of animals work together in packs, and birds and bees have highly sophisticated minds. Bees have highly organized hive hierarchy, but there’s no proof they are calling on their personal memory. We’re the only species that is simultaneously on a quest to understand why we have arrived where we’re at today, how we got here, and yet, at the same time, be in the position to create an outcome of our choosing. It’s why we are able to envision a world that goes beyond our wildest imagination — one with driverless cars, flying machines, robots, and space travel. There is evidence that we are not finished evolving. Several predictions for our future are terrifying, but some point to technology and culture-shaping the way our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will look. With medical advances, and more people living into adulthood, Darwin’s theory of the survival of the fittest flies out the window. Instead, humans may select mates based on intellectual abilities for greater earning power, and technological advances may create humans who are better nourished, and therefore taller than their ancestors. One thing’s for sure, with modern advances in technology, the next iteration of people will have no shortage of places to learn about life and how we got here.", "date": "2017-06-16,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Don’t Put it Off: Procrastination", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/dont-put-it-off-procrastination/", "abstract": "We all procrastinate. Whether it’s hitting the snooze button again, not wanting to go to the dentist, or putting off an unpleasant task awaiting you (you know, that one …), we all have things we love to do and things we hate to do. We do them — eventually ; the question is, what will it take to get us to do them? That sage of the early 20 th century, Robert Benchley, may have put it best (as he usually did) in 1930 when he wrote , “Anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn’t the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment.” When assigned an article on procrastination, I (of course) put it off for various reasons (some of them were even legitimate): not enough time, laziness, or just a chance to tell people we were supposed to be writing an article about procrastinating but kept putting it off. Faced with the choice of actually working and the ignominy of not turning in an assignment, once I started, I found that the topic of procrastination is quite interesting and gives us an insight into human psychology. While there are probably as many reasons for putting things off as there are people who procrastinate, they all seem to share common roots. Five of them stood out: Fear Perfectionism Difficulty getting started Lack of motivation Distractions Let’s take a little closer look at each of them and see if we can find any workarounds. Fear This is a large category, with many sub-categories: Fear of Failure, Fear of Success, Fear of Incompetence, and Fear of the Outcome. The first of these — fear of failure — may be the most common. We’ve probably all been faced with something that seems beyond our capabilities: preparing an event, writing a research paper, passing a test — so much so that the task itself takes on greater importance and increases the need for alibis: “I don’t know enough about that!”,“Why did I agree to do this?!”,“I’m going to screw this up!” The upshot is that when we don’t have enough confidence in our abilities, we build up scenarios about what could happen if we were to inevitably fail — getting fired, getting kicked out of school, losing status. Hand in hand with that fear (ironically) is the fear of success. If we complete a task successfully, we may be expected to reach that same level of success — and even greater ones  in the future—setting ourselves up for a Peter Principle downfall, the idea that being so good at something that we’re promoted to the point of our own incompetence, which is our third fear. We’ve all had that feeling of being in a position for which we don’t feel qualified. (Personally, when I appeared on Jeopardy , even though I knew I was prepared to play the game, I had decades of expectations packed into 22 minutes of playing the TV show game on camera. I had to put up or shut up. Fortunately, I won, but that didn’t ease the feelings of insecurity, wondering if I was actually up to par.) The last type of fear is the fear of the outcome; the fear that the results won’t live up to our expectations. We worry about how correct our analysis is and whether the recommended follow-up is the right one. Will that mole need treatment? Will signing up at that gym yield the results we want? While some of these fears seem foolish, it can be hard to see past them and get perspective. The best way to handle them may be to externalize them. Talk with colleagues, friends, and loved ones. Ask for help. Put something down in writing and get feedback. Getting confirmation that we’re on the right track or seeing where we may have erred — while the process is ongoing — is invaluable. Even if the final product is flawed, it can ultimately be corrected. Even the Supreme Court corrects its mistakes. The most important thing is this: if you’ve been given a task, it’s generally because you’re the most qualified person to do it. You’ve demonstrated enough knowledge, skill, or expertise on a subject to make you the go-to expert on it. If it’s a personal goal (a diet, a new field of study, a new job, or moving to a new city), embrace the fact that change isn’t easy, but you’ll end up growing as a result of it. You’ve decided to pursue it because you have an interest in making a change and are intentionally altering the course of your life. The most important thing to remember is, if you’ve been given a task, it’s generally because you’re the most qualified person to do it. Perfectionism Anyone who’s ever created anything, whether it’s building a bookshelf or baking a pie, has in their heads a Platonic ideal (an absolutely flawless version) of it. That image often bears little resemblance to the final product, though. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse, but it rarely ends up becoming what we envisioned. That disconnect can stop us from starting a task. It’s a fear that the final product, no matter how much effort we put into it, won’t end up as perfect as we want. We might believe that we don’t have the skills or tenacity to pull it off. Instead, we can just keep planning or thinking or researching or putting it off. Procrastination can be comforting — while the idea is in your head, it will remain perfect and immune from criticism. Everyone wants to do something great, and no one wants to show off something miserable. If you never actually have a final product, how can people criticize it? In cases like this, we owe it to ourselves to acknowledge that while we may fall short, we shouldn’t give into the temptation of thinking that we don’t have to give it our best. How many times have we either seen something that was obviously slap-dash and thought “Well, they didn’t put much work into that ”? How much better to put just a little more effort into something and get a result that far exceeds what we envisioned? It’s important to realize — and acknowledge — that we can only do our best and give it our best effort. Nothing in this world — not the Eiffel Tower, not the Mona Lisa , not the Taj Mahal — is perfect, and if we give ourselves some leeway, we can accept that our creations have merit and are of interest. “Anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn’t the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment.” – Robert Benchley Difficulty Getting Started How easy is it to make excuses? “I haven’t done enough research,” “I just need to do one more thing before I start”, or “I’ve got plenty of time.” Those excuses — especially the last one — are fatal. There may be external factors preventing us from starting projects — having to wait for a response, inability to get information, lack of physical proximity, or an official starting date. More often than not, those restrictions are self-imposed rationalizations. You’re only fooling yourself. The deadline, goal, or final product is still looming over you no matter how long you try to deny it. Even if you’re waiting for something that is truly out of your control, are there parts of the project you can still pursue? Sections you can write? Research that isn’t dependent on external factors? There’s always some part of a project that you can get out of the way. It’s possible that working on something other than what you need to be working on may point you toward something new you hadn’t considered before. If nothing else, getting started means you might finish early and could avoid having the whole thing hanging over your head in the first place. Lack of Motivation This one is sort of a combination of the others. Unless it’s a topic or project that you’re extremely interested in, there’s probably going to be a cooling-off point before you’ve completed it. (If it’s something that really interests you, you’re much likelier to pursue it rather than procrastinate.) Whether that pause comes from the fears listed above or you’re just plain putting it off out of lack of interest, or outside factors, you need to overcome them. A study by Carnegie Mellon University’s Eberly Center showed that students lacked motivation when they had trouble understanding the personal relevance of their classes or the work they were doing in them. To find motivation, figure out why you’re doing a task and what meaning it has to you, and to your life. Things as simple as paying the bills or preparing dinner can be onerous, but when you realize that it’s less desirable to get calls from collection agencies or starve, the motivation will appear — as if by magic. On a practical level, writing a report or tackling that job no one else wants will make you the go-to person on that topic and more valuable on the job. Cleaning up your apartment will make it a more pleasant place to live. Preparing an assignment for a class may let you learn something new. The trick is to find your personal way into the subject or task. If you have to find something out to let someone else know about it, that information will be much more interesting because it has your unique spin on it. If your task is personal, realize how it’s going to improve your life. If nothing else, getting started on it — and finishing it — gets it done, out of the way, and either out of your life or a much richer part of it. And that in itself should be motivation enough. Distractions Distraction is both the most common symptom — and the easiest — to get around. It’s hard to get away from distractions. It’s easy when reading or writing something to have a television or music on in the background, your phone next to you, and the internet calling. There might be loud conversations near you, noise outside, or coffee shop employees calling out orders — anything that keeps you from concentrating fully on the task at hand. Obviously, if we’re doing something we’re not totally invested in, we’ll be looking for something — anything — to keep up our interest while working, but those distractions aren’t good for you or your task. Content, for example, could be compromised by spelling errors, lack of fact checking, or shallow research. A physical job, like painting a room or fixing a car,  might be missing details or important steps. Despite all of our protesting, studies have shown over and over again that people cannot multi-task . The best — though potentially most painful — advice is to focus solely on the thing you need to do or should be doing. Shut off your phone (whether physically or by using one of the many apps that will limit your time to use it), go to a quiet space — or at least one with minimal distractions. The price may seem high at first, but the payoff of a really successful result will be more than worth it.", "date": "2017-06-22,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "A Word of Gratitude to Evernote’s Founder", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/a-word-of-gratitude-to-evernotes-founder/", "abstract": "June 24th marked the ninth year since Evernote emerged from private testing to a public open beta. Over that time, more than 200 million people have used Evernote to create over five billion notes all around the world. Much of my time is spent thinking about Evernote’s future, however on this occasion, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on Evernote’s past, its origins and more specifically about the man whose vision and foresight led him to found our company, Stepan Pachikov. Let me explain who Stepan Pachikov is and how his notions changed the world. Every day, there is a very good chance that you’re touched by something Stepan invented. Ever sign your name with a stylus directly on a computer or handheld device? The ability for computers to read handwriting—that was Stepan’s invention. If you’re in the United States, and you’ve received a nice handwritten letter through the US Postal Service—Stepan came up with the technology used to automatically read and direct handwritten mail to the right place. He was also one of the pioneers of VRML, or Virtual Reality Modeling Language, so you can thank Stepan every time you play an immersive video game, too. In 2002, Stepan first thought of creating Evernote because he was a smart guy with a terrible memory. He dreamed of a way to make a copy of your entire brain, capturing information and thoughts at the speed at which we think.  He has taught me never to lose sight of the idea that “a person’s reach should exceed their grasp.” He is always one or two (or several hundred) steps in front of everybody else. Stepan is a visionary in the truest sense of the word. I love listening to him talk about his personal passions and ideas on where Evernote should go in the next 5-10 years. I want to thank Stepan. I want to thank him for insisting on product excellence. He always says, “the best product experience wins.” And he’s right. I want to thank him for his curiosity, which I find inspiring. I thank him for always making me think, and for his confidence and belief in me. And I want to thank him for the immense amount of customer passion that he’s created in the world. For building this community of people who rally around the banner of Evernote. As the late Robin Williams once said, all of us are “only given a little spark of madness. You mustn’t lose it.” I’d like to thank Stepan for never losing his childlike wonder and imagination even in the face of adversity and for not being afraid to turn outrageous ideas into real, useful products — people like Stepan Pachikov are the ones who have the power to change the world. He certainly has. Thanks, Stepan.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Change Your Desk, Change Your Life?", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/change-your-desk-change-your-life/", "abstract": "The idea that orderliness breeds success reigns supreme. But what if messiness, especially a messy desk, offers its own rewards? What if we could eat healthier, be more generous, or better solve creative conundrums by curating our workspace differently, by making them either tidier or messier? Messy creatives: let’s start with you Clutter gets a bad rap. But relatively new research from the University of Minnesota affirms the common justification that messiness encourages creativity. Kathleen Vohs, the scientist and professor who spearheaded the study, first noticed that desk tidiness influences outcomes when she moved office buildings during her Ph.D. studies. Vohs suspected that the new environment was influencing her test subjects, and ended up discovering through research that her hypothesis held weight. To gauge relative creativity in tidy versus cluttered environments, Vohs and her team of researchers asked 48 participants in both clean and messy rooms to come up with as many uses for ping pong balls as possible. The result? Those in the messy room generated five times as many highly creative ideas compared with their counterparts. “Being in a messy room led to something that firms, industries, and societies want more of: creativity,” Vohs shared . She elaborated , “Cluttered minds can lead to all kinds of pathways and solutions.” It should be noted that the study was small, so we shouldn’t take the findings as gospel. “Cluttered minds can lead to all kinds of pathways and solutions.” — Dr. Kathleen Vohs Some of history’s foremost innovators built miraculous order from messy workspaces. Upon Albert Einstein’s passing , journalist Ralph Morse visited Einstein’s office at the Institute of Advanced Studies and discovered his desk littered with stacks of paper. Einstein had once said, “If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?” Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Toby Hsieh have also all been known to work from cluttered desks, and Mark Twain is said to have cleaned up minimally. Of course, heightened creativity is the result of more than just having papers strewn across your desk. Recent neuroscientific research shows that in creative-minded people, the areas of the brain that create imagination are especially well-connected. While letting your workspace run a little wild might augment creativity, the link is not necessarily causal. Clean your workspace to clean up your diet? On the flip side, according to Vohs’ research, having a clean desk might offer some unexpected benefits: namely, a greater likelihood of making healthier food choices. In the same study, researchers asked 34 participants in the clean and messy rooms to fill out a questionnaire. Upon leaving, the participants were offered either a candy bar or an apple. 67 percent of the tidy room participants chose the apple, while only 20 percent of the cluttered room ones did. “When people are in a tidy room, they seem to perform behaviors and make decisions that go along with what’s expected,” Vohs explained . In that same vein, when asked after finishing the questionnaire whether they’d like to donate to charity, 82 percent of the clean room participants said yes, as compared to 47 percent of cluttered room participants. Vohs and her team suggest, then, that orderliness produces generosity too. These results may or may not be representative of human nature, however, due to the tiny size of the study. The link between organization and stress In his book The Organized Mind , cognitive psychologist Daniel J. Levitin explores the evolution of the human brain. He examines how we can organize our minds and lives in the age of information overload. Of the process of organizing, Levitin shares, “Many successful people report that they experience mental benefits from organizing or reorganizing their closets or drawers when they’re stressed. And we now understand the neurological substrates: this activity allows our brains to explore new connections among the things that clutter our living spaces while simultaneously allowing the mind-wandering mode to recontextualize and re-categorize those objects’ relationships to one another and our relationship to them.” In other words, for some of us, the very act of organizing our spaces reduces stress. And that, in turn, has the power to make us more productive . When we feel stressed and pulled in different directions – perhaps by the clutter on our desks — taking a couple minutes to organize it might help us sort our thoughts. Should you keep your desk tidy or messy? Rather than curating your desk in one way or another indefinitely, consider simply changing your workspace to see how it influences your experience. If you’re typically a more tidy person, what might you learn if you let clutter accumulate for a couple of days? If you consider yourself to be more of a messier person, what benefit might come from organizing your desk? Perhaps by stretching our boundaries, we can experience more of the flavors life has to offer. Leave us a comment: do you keep a tidy or messy desk and why? We’d love to hear from you .", "date": "2017-07-12,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Tapping Into the Daily Rituals of Our Great Creative Minds", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/the-daily-rituals-of-our-creative-minds/", "abstract": "History can teach us a lot about the way we work today. Benjamin Franklin rigorously planned and segmented his daily routine in an effort to accomplish good each day. Thomas Edison used an epic to-do list to fuel his prolific innovation and inventions. Out of superstition, Tchaikovsky took a daily two-hour walk. His return was timed precisely: not a minute early, not a minute late. Mason Currey , author of Daily Rituals: How Artists Work , researched and profiled 161 artists, composers, philosophers, playwrights, scientists, writers, and poets. What he found can help you improve your daily work habits and keep you productive, particularly during those early morning hours. We recently spoke with Mason about the work rituals and routines of great creative minds. We all start each day on equal footing. Does it matter when, or how, we start those 24 hours? It definitely matters when and how you start the day—but that doesn’t mean that there’s one “right” way to do so. In my research, I found great creative minds who woke up at 4:00 a.m. and who slept until noon (or later); who went immediately to work and who spent hours waiting for the proper mood to arrive. What all these people have in common is that they devised a schedule and a set of habits that suited their temperaments and life circumstances—and that, in most cases, they organized their days (and, by extension, their lives) around creating the best conditions for their creative work. Was there a particular part of the day that was most frequently the source of great productivity for these 161 creative minds you chronicled? Early mornings are a popular working time for many writers and artists, for a few obvious reasons. If you get up early enough, you can generally count on being free from visitors, phone calls, and other interruptions. And if you go straight to work on your creative project—if you literally put it first in your day—you can guarantee that your working time won’t be derailed by other commitments or temptations. Ben Franklin is credited with having his entire day segmented and planned. How important is it to start the morning off right? Should we all be asking ourselves, “What good shall we do today?” Franklin’s schedule is another good example of how, I think, one’s routine should be tailored to his or her temperament. Franklin was, of course, a great believer in continual self-improvement, and his schedule very much reflects that. (It’s also worth noting that his famous daily scheme was his ideal schedule for the day, and not necessarily the one he actually followed most days.) So I don’t think everyone should start off the morning by asking themselves what good they shall do that day—but I do think we should follow Franklin’s example of treating our daily schedule as an opportunity and a tool, and tailor it to suit our priorities in life. Do you have tips from researching how people can embrace the morning to accomplish more earlier in the day? I think the key is going to straight to work, with a minimum of pit stops along the way. And the more susceptible you are to distractions, the harder you have to be on yourself. Some people can read the newspaper and have breakfast with their spouse and then get to work with no problem; others have to immediately get to work before doing anything else, or else risk losing the entire workday. I think you have to really take stock of your weaknesses and then craft a schedule that protects you from your worst habits. The people featured in your book didn’t have the constant distractions of the web and social media within striking distance of a computer key. How can modern workers, creatives, or knowledge workers fight distraction to become more productive? Even though most of my subjects didn’t have to contend with the Internet, many of them did have a lot of distractions in their lives—some lived in large, bustling households; others were the centers of busy literary or artistic circles; and still others had day jobs, parallel careers, or time-consuming side projects. So working in the face of constant distraction is not a new problem, even if the Internet has made it more acute. And I think the solution, then as now, is to carve out some distraction-free working time each day—to set aside a certain number of hours to work on your most important project, and then ruthlessly protect those hours. Evernote lets people capture information, take notes, create to-do lists, and archive learnings. In a way, this is how people have been working for years. What does it say about the timelessness of the creative minds you’ve researched? Well, as you say, these are longstanding habits that obviously have a tremendous amount of utility for many artists. And I think digital tools make it easier to capture, store, and refer back to all the various notes and to-do lists that can be an essential part of the creative process. You differentiate between rituals and routines? Can you explain the importance of both? I like to think of a routine as a plan or framework for each day, and a ritual as a specific behavior within that larger framework. And I think they’re both important. Devising a daily routine forces you to prioritize your life, and a good routine ensures that you’re reserving time each day for your most important work. Rituals are a little more mysterious. Counting out the precise number of coffee beans for your morning cup (as Beethoven did), or standing by the kitchen window and watching for the very first slivers of the sunrise (as Toni Morrison does)—things like this can help you ease into the right state of mind for creative work. But I think each individual has to stumble into his or her own most effective rituals—you can’t just borrow Beethoven’s habits and expect a sudden influx of genius. Is there a common bond shared by the great minds you researched? I think the common bond is a certain degree of ruthlessness. The figures in my book put their creative work first, even when doing so was to the detriment of their relationships, their health, and their financial well-being. I’m not necessarily advising people to follow their example—I just think it’s important to keep in mind that maximizing your creative potential probably means minimizing some other aspect of your life. Was there a specific schedule that stood out to you? It’s hard to pick favorites. A few details that stood out to me: Tchaikovsky superstitiously taking a daily walk of precisely two hours in duration, and refusing to return home even a few minutes early, for fear of some great misfortune befalling him; Friedrich Schiller claiming that he kept a drawer full of rotting apples in his workroom, because he needed their decaying smell in order to feel the urge to write; Maya Angelou renting a “tiny, mean” hotel or motel room in order to do her writing, and surrounding herself with a dictionary, a Bible, a deck of cards, and a bottle of Sherry. The book covers authors, writers, and creatives, but what can we learn from them to apply to the type of disciplines and professionals who don’t work in a creative setting? I think a lot of this stuff applies to other professions. If you want to be a successful lawyer, doctor, or entrepreneur, you’re probably struggling with some of the same issues—how to pursue a time-intensive career while also being a responsible parent or spouse or friend; how to continue working on something when you’re discouraged or exhausted or uninspired; how to maximize your time and mental energy. My book doesn’t provide any concrete answers to these dilemmas, but it does show how a variety of brilliant and successful people confronted these and other obstacles on a daily basis. What was your process for creating, researching, and writing? Did you have a specific schedule? When I was compiling the book, I was also working a full-time job as a magazine editor, so the only way I could figure out to do both things was to get up really early in the morning. I got in the habit of waking at 5:30 a.m. every weekday and working on the book for two hours. Then I would have breakfast with my wife, take a shower, go to the office, and have a normal workday. And then a few evenings a week I would go to one of the branches of the New York Public Library to do book research. It was a grueling schedule, but it was also kind of marvelous—it’s amazing how much you can get done when you’re really busy. Nowadays I have more free time and accomplish less. Because so many of us get lost in the noise and constant cascade of information hurtled at us from every direction, do you have advice for modern workers who want to be successful? My advice is to figure out at what time of day you do your best work. For me, it’s early in the morning; for others, it may be late at night or in the middle of the afternoon. And then do whatever you can to arrange your schedule in order to carve out some focused working hours at that time every day (including weekends, if at all possible). This doesn’t have to be a huge block of time—many successful writers, for instance, only actually write for a couple hours a day. The key is doing it at the same time every day; there’s something magical about that repetition.", "date": "2015-02-10,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "10 Ways to Boost Your Writing Productivity", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/10-ways-to-boost-your-writing-productivity/", "abstract": "Every writer has been there: the words are inside you, trying to get out, but life is in the way. Maybe you can’t find any time in your busy schedule. Or you can’t stay focused when you sit down to write. Or you have a great writing session one day, and then your work in progress sits neglected for weeks. Whether you’re writing a novel , maintaining a blog, or keeping a journal, the answers to these problems are mostly the same. Writing is like exercise: adopt a sensible training regimen, apply it consistently, and you’ll grow stronger. But it’s also like meditation: open your inner doors, let go of distractions, and you’ll become more centered. In both cases, the keys are discipline and focus. With that in mind, here are ten simple techniques you can use to keep yourself in the writing zone. 1. KNOW THYSELF Are you a morning person? A night owl? Do you crash at 3:00 every afternoon? Do you tend to use weekends and holidays for activity or recovery? Figure out what times of the day (or week) are your peak times for creative energy and which times are dead zones. Many writers do their best work early in the morning, before the cares of the day have a chance to clutter their minds, but you may do better after everyone else has gone to bed. Experiment. 2. CARVE OUT TIME If writing is a priority for you, prove it. Put writing time down on your calendar, and keep that time as sacred as you can. If you’re busy, that may mean saying “no” to other commitments. Give your schedule a ruthless review. Your writing is important, so what’s less important? Get rid of it. Sometimes it’s not a lack of free time so much as lack of motivation. If that sounds like you, try setting a deadline for your writing, and hold yourself accountable by telling people what you’re working on and when you plan to deliver. 3. CLAIM YOUR SPACE Stake your claim to a writing nook. Maybe it’s a desk in your home, a “quiet space” in your office, or a favorite café. Be sure to pick a comfortable place with a positive atmosphere, someplace you’ll want to visit every day. Build a mental wall around it. Whenever you go there, tell yourself this is writing time and let the rest of the world fade away. If you can’t claim a physical space, no worries. Get yourself a writing hat or some other symbol that signifies “writing time.” When the hat is on, you’re in your virtual writing space and not to be disturbed. For this to work the hat can only be on when you’re actually writing . Take it off when you’re done. 4. SCOUT THE TERRITORY Writing is usually easier if you know where you’re going ahead of time. That doesn’t mean you need a detailed outline, but it does mean you should do your homework. Research, brainstorm, and organize your thoughts so you have a direction to follow. If you’re writing a story, visualize the next scene and put yourself in your characters’ shoes. If you’re writing an article, read and take notes on what other experts have said about your topic. At the end of your writing session, think ahead and jot down a few words about what comes next. When you come back later, you’ll be able to jump right in. 5. CLEAR YOUR MIND You’ve heard it time and again: eliminate distractions. But what does that really mean? First, unplug from email and social media. If you just can’t stay away from Facebook and Twitter, consider installing software that will temporarily block them . Don’t forget to silence your phone, too. If you like working to music, wear comfortable headphones and try music without vocals like instrumental jazz, chamber music, electronica, or ambient sound. Getting rid of distractions extends to the tools you use. Switch your favorite writing app to full-screen mode or hide formatting toolbars so it’s just you and your words. 6. GET IN THE GROOVE Starting from zero can be tough. Try loosening up with a few minutes of free-writing, like stretching before a run. Give yourself a simple prompt (perhaps the sounds around you, or your favorite Muppet) and write about that for five minutes without stopping or thinking about the words. Just go. You don’t have to save what you write, or even look at it afterwards. But it will flex your creative muscles. Another good technique for longer writing projects is to start by reading over what you wrote the last time. But be careful: don’t fall into the trap of editing if you’re supposed to be writing (see #8 below). 7. WRITE IN BURSTS Some people are good at focusing on a single task for a long time. Most of us aren’t. If you have a short attention span, make it work for you by concentrating your writing into short, intense bursts. Set a timer for 15 or 25 minutes, then write as fast as you can until the timer tells you to stop. Give yourself a nice break (that means getting up and leaving the computer, not surfing the web), then come back and do it again. Even little bits of writing can add up fast. If you can average 500 words a day, five days a week, you’re writing 130,000 words per year. That’s a book or two. Or dozens of short stories. Or hundreds of blog posts. Not bad. 8. JUST KEEP GOING Don’t let fear of imperfection slow you down. If you’re in the rough draft phase, let it be rough. Silence your inner editor (its time will come later) and get the words down on the page. Once you can see the whole draft, then you can fix it. Set a milestone for each writing session. If word counts are too intimidating, just commit to putting in the minutes. Keep your goals small and the accomplishments will pile up quickly, propelling you forward. 9. REWARD YOURSELF When you do hit a milestone, celebrate. Tantalize yourself with big rewards for the big goals (an activity or a long-awaited purchase) and little rewards for the daily goals (a piece of candy or an episode of your favorite tv show). Even a tiny reward can be powerful. Get a wall calendar and mark each day you hit your goal. Add a sticker or stars on the days you really crush it. Once you have a streak going, you’ll want to keep it up. 10. ALWAYS BE READY Inspiration can strike anywhere and any time. You might overhear something on the street, stumble across a useful article in a magazine, or have a brilliant idea after you’ve gone to bed. Make sure you always have a way to record those flashes of insight, whether that’s Evernote on your phone or a Moleskine notebook in your pocket.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How Amy Stewart Brought History to Life With Evernote", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-amy-stewart-brought-history-to-life/", "abstract": "This article is part of a series that explores how authors use Evernote for writing. Sometimes, truth is more compelling than fiction. Take the story of a hardened gin smuggler and a pistol-packing spinster whose paths collided in an accident on the streets of Victorian-era New York. Amy Stewart , a best-selling author, discovered that story and saved it from the dustbin of history. She came across the intriguing headline, “Girl Waits With Gun” in a 1915 issue of the New York Times while researching her book, The Drunken Botanist . That headline is now the title of her latest book, an historical novel based on the real-life Constance Kopp, who goes to extreme lengths to protect her sisters. The book is creating a lot of buzz and much of the source material she discovered was collected and saved with the help of Evernote. We recently spoke with Amy over email about how Evernote was a pivotal resource to researching her book. Some of the advice she provides is perfect for understanding how you can collect and organize source material into Evernote whether you’re writing the next big historical novel, or even tackling a thesis paper. Evernote tools Amy uses to research her writing: * Evernote Web Clipper * Table of Contents * Chronological note links * Evernote camera The following is excerpted from our email exchange about Evernote features for researching, written by Amy Stewart last week. Clip into history Girl Waits With Gun started with a single newspaper article from 1914. I was just finishing my research for The Drunken Botanist (oh, how I wish I had used Evernote for that book!), and I was trying to find out more about a gin smuggler named Henry Kaufman. The New York Times had this story about a guy named Henry Kaufman who ran his car into a buggy being driven by Constance, Norma, and Fleurette Kopp. I was fascinated with the Kopps. Today I have 634 newspaper clippings about the Kopps in Evernote, and about 1,100 more notes and materials that serve as background research and ideas for future books, in chronological order by when the stories ran. Capture history with Evernote Camera When I go to New Jersey and New York to do research, I take photographs in Evernote at each location. The geo-tagging function is a huge help here. For instance, I went and stood on street corner where Constance waited with her gun to catch the Black Handers, and took photographs of any buildings that looked like they might have been there in 1914. Last year I went to the National Archives to look through microfilmed documents related to intelligence activities during World War I, which will serve as background for a future book in the series. I realized that researchers were no longer printing out pages from microfilm machines, but instead were just taking pictures of the screen with their phones. I opened my Evernote app and started photographing pages and tagging them so that by the time I left, I had not only gathered my research, but organized it. Harness Powerful search I’ve got about another thousand or so notes, photos, clippings, and files related to the world the Kopps’ lived in, and future book ideas. It’s great to be able to search Evernote and pull up everything I’ve got on that character. My big goal for the future is to figure out how to integrate Ancestry records into Evernote so I’m not flipping between them. Maintain sense of order For newspaper articles, birth certificates, and any other document with a date attached to it, I created a single notebook and named every note according to the date it was published so I could sort them chronologically, like this: 1914 11-23 Girl Waits With Gun for Black Handers Sorting those notes by title puts them in chronological order. Chronological note links have also been useful for keeping a record of conflicting information — like one newspaper article said a thing happened in August and another said it happened in July. Here’s a timeline I create in the notes by using the paste note link feature–so basically, newspapers report on things that happened in the past, sometimes things that happened months previously. So for me to put the events in order, I have to create a timeline and cite which newspaper article gave me that date. It’s helpful to sort the newspaper articles in order, as I showed you in the previous screenshot, but then the next step is to put the actual events in order with a link to where I found that information. Create a Table of Contents Because some of those newspaper articles describe events that happened earlier, such as a September 1914 article that recounts events that happened over several days in July, I also created a table of contents using Note Links ( Thanks for that tip! ) to put together the complete chronology of what happened, along with a link to the newspaper article that was the source for that detail. That chronology gives me the beginning of an outline for each novel in the series, and as I write I refer back to it constantly to make sure I haven’t gotten carried away and messed up the timeline. Build a word list I try to read as much 1914-era fiction and nonfiction as I can just to get a feel for the language. Every time I run across a word or phrase that seems unique to the era, I reach for my smartphone, tablet, or whatever gadget is handy, and add it to the list. I wait until some later stage in the revision process to pull out that list and see if I can put any of those words to use. You’ll see “reseda green” and “nainsook chemise” in Girl Waits with Gun — both of those came right out of my Evernote word list.", "date": "2015-10-23,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Resolve to Stay on Track in the New Year", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/resolve-to-stay-on-track-in-the-new-year/", "abstract": "A new year is upon us, which means it’s time to break out the champagne and survey the months ahead. It’s only natural to think in terms of fresh starts and new opportunities when the calendar changes, whether that means improving our health, acquiring a new skill, or picking up a neglected hobby. But as many of us know, resolving to change is one thing. Making those changes stick is another. Research suggests that one-third of all new year’s resolutions are abandoned within the first month, and fewer than half survive to the six-month mark. It’s better to try and fail than never to try at all, but most of us want to do better than that. How can we keep our resolutions going all year long? According to experts in psychology and productivity, the answer has three parts: First, we need to be smarter about how we make resolutions, and choose the right goals for the right reasons. Second, we need to implement new behaviors in the ways most likely to turn them into ingrained habits. Finally, we need the willpower, planning, and support to stay motivated and on track, especially in the critical first month. Step 1: Get SMART Let’s start with the resolutions themselves. It’s not enough to have a good idea. You have to distill that idea into a goal that’s actionable and attainable . Borrowing a concept from modern business, sociologist Christine Whelan has described a well-crafted resolution as “SMART” — it’s specific , measurable , and achievable , there’s a reward for sticking with it, and our progress is tracked throughout the year. Just as importantly, you have to want it. As Linda Geddes recently summarized in an article for The Guardian , “The first question to ask yourself is: if there were no pressure from anyone else, what would you, personally, like to change?” Whether we’re trying to lose weight or write a novel , we’re more likely to stick with difficult projects when the motivation comes from within. Step 2: Get in the habit Another reason resolutions fall apart is that we try to take on too much at once. When you commit to changing a behavior, you’re essentially trying to rewire your own brain, and that takes a lot of work. Every time you need to stop and think, to exercise self-control, or remember to do X instead of Y, you’re burning mental energy. Going after too many difficult goals at the same time can leave you burned out, with none of your goals fulfilled. To maximize your chances of success, choose just one resolution . If you have a list of ideas, consider starting with the easiest one. You wouldn’t try to run a marathon if you’ve never run a mile, or deadlift a huge weight without lifting smaller weights first. The same applies to willpower and self-control. Start small and work your way up. Like a snowball rolling downhill, big changes can accumulate from tiny ones. Doing one hundred pushups is hard, doing five is easier. And nearly all of us can manage one. “Eating healthy” is big and vague, but adding a sprig of broccoli to your plate is tiny and simple. As Leo Babauta puts it, “make it so easy you can’t say no.” Put another way, the idea is to focus on the habit, not the goal . If we’re in this for the long term, the important thing is simply to acquire the habit, not to make big gains fast. Losing 20 pounds doesn’t mean much if you’re only focused on the number and not internalizing healthy habits; it’s too easy to slip and gain it all back. Try fitting your new habit into the daily routines you already have. Routines run on autopilot and resist big changes, but they’re easy to hack from within once you understand how they work. Generally speaking, habitual behavior begins with a trigger or cue , and results in some sort of psychological reward: At 3:00, I take a coffee break in the office. The coffee tastes good and makes me feel alert. In this example, 3:00 is the cue, the coffee break is the behavior, and feeling alert is the reward. If you can insert a new behavior or task into this cycle, leaving the cue and the reward intact, your brain should adapt more easily, especially if you’ve kept the task small: At 3:00, I walk to the fancy coffee bar on Broadway. The coffee tastes good and makes me more alert, I get a little exercise, and the fresh air clears my head. You don’t need any particular motivation to make the change, because you’re already doing pretty much the same thing. And that makes it easy to gradually ramp up to your objective. At 3:00, I go for a brisk power-walk . It gives me some exercise, clears my head, reduces stress, and makes me more alert. The cue has not changed. The rewards are similar, but greater. But the behavior has completely changed. Of course, this doesn’t happen overnight. It may take a long time to get where you want to go, through a succession of tiny steps. But as long as each step is headed in the right direction, you’ll get there in the end. Step 3: Stay motivated with Evernote Okay. You’ve made a resolution. It’s specific, measurable, and achievable. You’ve fit it into your routine and made sure there will be a reward for sticking with it. Now you need to stay motivated to keep the cycle going. Consider creating a Personal Development notebook in Evernote where you can keep it all together. Here’s some of what goes in your resolution notebook: a calendar an inspiration archive checklists and reminders Calendar Calendars are simple yet powerful motivational tools. When you successfully achieve your daily goal, mark your calendar. That’s it. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld famously used this method when building his career, making sure he wrote new material every day. Seeing a string of marked days on a calendar is a great way to build confidence and a sense of accomplishment. It also provides gentle pressure: you’ll go out of your way to make sure you “don’t break the chain.” We have some great 2016 calendars you can save right into Evernote. Just click the links below and look for the “Save to Evernote” button. Once you’ve saved them, add your milestones or targets and start tracking your progress: Yearly calendar Monthly calendar — Simple Gray Monthly calendar — Live Green Weekly calendar — Gray & Green Daily calendar — Gray & Green Checklists and reminders Need a little push? Build checklists and reminders into your Evernote workflow so you never forget to keep working on your new habits. Good checklists might include your gym routines, that list of great books you plan to read or movies you’ve always wanted to watch, or themes to tackle in a 365-day photo project . Inspiration archive Found an article or image online that inspires you? Use Web Clipper to capture it in Evernote. Build a collection of examples you can turn to when you feel your motivation drooping. If you use IFTTT to connect Evernote with other apps, there are recipes available for capturing favorite tweets or other social media updates in notes, recording your locations and check-ins, and much more.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Taking Note: How Note-taking Improves Reading—An Interview with Shane Parrish", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-note-taking-improves-reading/", "abstract": "This post is part of an ongoing series, “Taking Note,” which outlines the history and styles of note taking. Throughout the coming weeks, we’ll explore how taking notes can improve your creativity and all the work you set out to accomplish. Whether you read for information or entertainment, reading well depends on your engagement with the material. Just ask Shane Parrish , founder of the Farnam Street website and newsletter . Farnam Street is geared towards helping people read better, and over the past few years, it has attracted an audience of voracious bibliophiles, CEOs, and knowledge workers, all hoping to get more out of what they read. In this interview, Shane talked with us about the importance of separating signal from noise—finding the things that truly matter in a sea of distraction. He also sings the praises of active note-taking, asking questions, drawing parallels, and connecting the dots to form new ideas based on what you read. The art of taking notes is nothing new, but the approach that Shane recommends may help you make those leaps in thought in a whole new way. How do you find the content you read? I like to make friends with the “eminent dead,” people like Benjamin Franklin , Seneca , Cicero , Marcus Aurelius , and David Foster Wallace . We’ll still be talking about them in 50 years, 100 years, and 500 years, because they wrote about the fundamentals of human nature. If I’m going to spend time learning something, I want it to be as timeless as possible. Of course, you also need to know what to look for. But good content is not that hard to find. I follow what I’m interested in learning—for me, that ranges from philosophy to biology, chemistry to psychology, economics to art. If I read something and I like it, I find the reference section in the back of the book is an incredibly helpful place to find something else to read on the same subject. I’m also incredibly fortunate. I believe that Farnam Street readers are the smartest readers on the Internet—when they send me book recommendations, I pay attention. I probably have more books than I’ll ever get to, and I’m OK with that. Having these books reminds me of my ignorance, and also excites my intellectual curiosity. There’s always something new to pursue. I just keep pushing and digging deeper into the things I’m interested in, and that seem timeless and useful. Are you consuming a broad range of content? For example, do you read books, articles, newspapers, and magazines? I’m promiscuous—I go where the knowledge is. What matters to me is that the benefit matches the level of effort required for what I’m reading. If I’m reading for information, it’s different from reading for learning. If I’m reading for entertainment, it’s going to be different still. And of course, the quest for information and entertainment sometimes overlap. You can learn while you read for entertainment or for information, and you can be entertained by your learning. I certainly am. Learning something deeply and fundamentally affects how you understand the world, and most of your reading can’t and won’t deliver that. The problem I see too frequently is, especially as people age, they begin to read exclusively for information and entertainment, and stop trying to learn. They stop dropping important new roots, and don’t even tend to the older ones anymore. To give you an example, I gave up reading most newspapers a few years back when I realized the noise to signal ratio was too high. The time I was spending reading them had too little benefit. It was time I could have spent reading books and learning fundamental things. Now, I’ll occasionally grab the weekend edition of a newspaper, but that’s more of a habit than a must-read now. One thing I’ve recently started to do is to print and queue articles rather than read them online. I’ll take a few hours every week, and just go through the folder. It’s really helped me focus, and I’ve cut down on the number of browser tabs I have open. More importantly, I feel like I’m reading better. I share my top five articles in my weekly digest, called Brain Food . For deep thinking, I still prefer physical books. Articles are great, and I read those mostly for gaining information. They are like seeing the tip of the iceberg, but books show you what’s below the water. In the past few years, I’ve been purchasing both a physical and digital copy of the same book. Publishers must love me. Do you read your books the same way digitally and by hand? No. I do enjoy my Kindle, but my comprehension level isn’t the same as with a physical book. I can’t flip back and forth as easily. I get distracted by the technology. And the iPad app affects my sleep. I suppose that’s one tradeoff for having a 500-book library in my pocket. If all were equal, I’d choose the physical book. The value of the book changes depending on, among other things, what, how, and when I’m reading, and on what I plan to do with the material after I’m finished. I’m more likely to read on my Kindle for information and/or entertainment, and read the deep and juicy stuff on paper. How do you discover new authors to read? I pick up books by multiple authors to try and see all sides of an argument. How do I find which authors to read? A few ways: I’ll search Amazon.com for the top-ranked books, and then read reviews of those books. I’ll reach out to experts in an industry. I’ll consult with a few friends who work in the publishing industry. These filters help me separate signal from noise. While there’s more noise than ever in modern life, we also have many ways to cut through it if we choose. Be ruthless about focusing your attention on the good stuff. Read the best biography you can find. Read the most timeless treatment on a topic. Read the best physics textbook ever written. I think anyone with that mindset can figure out ways to execute it. Ask around, read around. If you start in on something and you find that it’s not “the thing,” then put it down and look at something else. How do you take notes when you are reading? I keep all my notes in Evernote—whether through copy and pasting, image capture, or typing. Evernote helps me capture ideas and make connections while I’m reading. I start reading a book with the index, table of contents, and the preface—this normally gives me a good sense of the book, its vocabulary, and where the author wants to take me. In the text, I focus on what’s important; what I think is critical to the arguments in the piece I’m reading. I underline anything that strikes me as interesting. I circle words I need to look up for a better understanding. I mark comments and questions in the margins to try and tease out assumptions. Essentially, I’m trying to engage in a conversation with the author. After I’ve read the book and have absorbed what the author is trying to tell me, I’ll look at the notes again and see what’s changed since I started reading the book. If something still strikes my interest, I take notes in the first few pages of the book on that topic. Once I’ve captured my notes in Evernote I create a mental summary of the book’s main arguments and gaps that I think exist. When I can, I’ll cross-link points with other books. Tell us more about the summarizing process you mentioned. Why is it important? It is occasionally useful to write an outline on a blank sheet of paper, using examples, my own thoughts, and one or more of the main arguments of the book. I do this if I need to find out whether I actually understand what I’ve read or just know the name of it . This concept comes from the physicist Richard Feynman. He was able to articulate a deeper level of understanding that goes beyond categories or descriptions. For example, you can know the name of a bird, but beyond that, purely knowing the name does nothing to understanding how the bird flies: “See that bird? It’s a brown-throated thrush, but in Germany it’s called a halzenfugel , and in Chinese they call it a chung ling and even if you know all those names for it, you still know nothing about the bird. You only know something about people; what they call the bird. Now that thrush sings, and teaches its young to fly, and flies so many miles away during the summer across the country, and nobody knows how it finds its way.” You can know the name of the bird in any language, but learning about the bird—how it flies and what distinguishes itself from others, shows a deeper understanding, and as Feynman says, demonstrates the ability to differentiate “between knowing the name of something and knowing something.” So how do we do that, moving beyond raw information and into knowledge? We outline all this in an online course we put together on the art of reading called How to Read a Book . I’ll first preface by stating that there is a difference between knowing something and really understanding it . When you first pick up a book, you have to ask yourself if you’re reading it for information or to develop a deeper level understanding. A good heuristic is that anything we can easily digest is reading for information. Reading for understanding, however, is how we get smarter. I mentioned going through the front/back covers, the introduction, the table of contents, and skimming the chapters. That’s basically creating a mental map of the book. At this stage, you want to define, at least loosely, what type of book you’re reading. It’s not always as simple as it sounds. Is the Count of Monte Cristo an adventure, a romance, or a history? Is Moby Dick an adventure tale, a book on whaling, a memoir, or an allegory? And why does knowing matter? If the book is practical, it will tell us why and how something should be done; if it is theoretical, it will try to tell us what is true. A simple romance tale is mostly meant to entertain. It’s useful to categorize a bit in order to calibrate how closely you should be paying attention to the text. You can read The Bible for inspiration, for academic reasons, for historical purposes, or simply for entertainment.Get it clear with yourself why you’re reading a particular book. But once you’ve determined if a book is worthy of your time, it’s not just a matter of diving in. This is the analytical reading stage. And your note taking system will be key. The simple truth about note-taking is, however you do it, the purpose is to keep your thinking brain turned on and have a “dialogue” with the author. Taking notes is not really the point. The point is to avoid reading passively. The next step to optimizing your knowledge is to summarize the whole book in a single sentence (or at most a short paragraph). Finally, seek to understand the author’s problems. Where does the argument lie? Where does the uncertainty lie? Where are the borders of the author’s competence and knowledge—what does he or she know and what is speculation? The author won’t tell you, it’s your job to figure that out. Where you really get into developing a deep understanding of a topic is by doing comparative reading—digesting many books on the same subject and comparing and contrasting the ideas. This kind of comparison is called syntopical reading. There is a big difference between reading and reading well. And that difference grows in a non-linear manner over time. People who read well acquire new knowledge and ideas at a much faster rate. How do you use Evernote to take note of your reading?

The truth is, we often only appreciate it after we’ve become parents ourselves. We wonder how our moms could have possibly squeezed as much into every day as they did. Kara Layne is one working mom whose kids will know exactly how she managed it because she wrote it all down. Along with a mother’s patience, love, forbearance, and wisdom, Kara Layne has another tool in her ‘mom’s bag of tricks’: Evernote. Mom: entrepreneur, volunteer, writer, and artist Kara, a professional photographer, has four children—10, 8, 4, and 3—and she’s also a teen church leader, artist, and blogger . Her clients often comment on how easily she appears to do it all. “Anyone who is a parent knows the amount of chaos that comes with it is mind-blowing. When they get old enough to start school, that confusion is multiplied by 10. My husband and I face a mountain of paper daily. It gets overwhelming. Then add to that the non-stop barrage of mail, bills, business documents, banking statements, and the other necessary evils of paper, and it feels like we’re being buried alive. I manage what I can, and the rest has to find its place or be left behind.” A business solution comes home Help came when Kara started using Evernote last year for her business , a successful Phoenix, Arizona area photography studio and online store and blog. “As a photographer, I use Evernote for wardrobe and location ideas. It’s perfect for a client who wants a lot of detail. I can gather it all and share it with them . From an editorial sense, Evernote helps me organize ideas and drafts for blog posts, and collect the images that I want to use.” Kara said. “I keep a notebook for each of my branding and design clients, and I add and share ideas with them. Then I’ll use the very same tool to store receipts and business expenses and have it all automatically ready for tax time,” she added. “It hit me one day that the powerful tool I had at work could have practical uses at home. I picked up my phone at the kitchen table and started feeding all the physical paper I had into Evernote in hopes of reaching the surface. Over time, this process has gotten quicker, and I’ve totally organized the family’s paperwork clutter .” Expanding to other areas of the home, Kara, along with her husband, who also has his own startup commercial cleaning agency , discovered other Evernote lifehacks. “We share our to-do lists in Evernote. If I come across a bill or other expense that needs his attention, I add it to his list and set a reminder to catch him when he’s ready for it. If he sees something from our neighborhood community about an event we need to attend, he’ll do the same for me and add a reminder.” Creativity and family keep no time clock For someone in a creative profession like Kara, ideas don’t always come between 9 am and 5 pm. Inspiration could strike at any time. “I’ve had ideas for my blog while waiting at soccer practice, while picking up dinner, or waiting in a drive-through line,” she said. “When that happens I can use the voice recording feature in Evernote to record my thoughts . I put them in a notebook I already started. There is something comforting in knowing that I don’t have to try and remember it all. I can trust Evernote to store my ideas , and they’ll be available for me to search when I’m ready to work with them. When you’re a mom, your hands are always full. The voice feature has been a blessing.” Evernote, the Next Generation Kara has realized that it’s almost time to pass Evernote on to her children. She gave her eldest son a mobile phone for Christmas, and suddenly realized the potential to organize his school life using Evernote. “There is so much paperwork in schools—handouts, permission slips, calendars,” Kara said. “All he has to do is take a picture of these things with his phone, and nothing gets lost. It’s not a chore for him. He doesn’t even have to write anything down. I can teach him how to add tags so I can go in and look at it later.” See Kara’s work on Instagram Read Kara’s Blog", "date": "2016-05-26,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Make Yourself Note-able", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/make-yourself-note-able/", "abstract": "Each year at high school graduation time, as another freshly-minted generation of teenagers begins adulting, I always reflect on two memories that have stayed with me from my graduation: The cringe-worthy pictures of the overly-gelled hair that I sported for much too long. Thanks, Julie Greenspoon for still going to Freshman Homecoming with me! T he moment when the principal announced that I would be attending Harvard and my precalculus teacher said: “I just didn’t think you were that smart.” The implication that I had risen past the point of my own incompetence before even getting to college might have insulted some people, but not me. I pride myself on being an overachiever. I never crushed the standardized tests, and I certainly never had a photographic memory. What I had done well, though, was develop a system for learning that I still use today. The Plan: Get Better Grades, Remember Less Stuff I realized very early that if I wanted to overachieve, I needed to reduce the number of things I had to remember. Here was my initial plan: Take notes that identified the major themes for each subject. If I knew the main ideas for a class, I could always weave in whatever details I could remember. Create footnotes to connect ideas from different classes. For example, if I could apply a theme from an English paper on Native Son to a history test about Civil Rights, that meant I had one less fact to remember. Use my own shorthand so I could do visual searches for symbols quickly: triangles meant “change,” asterisks identified things to follow-up on, question marks highlighted things I didn’t understand yet. I couldn’t find any of my original paper notes from school, but I still use that shorthand and make these connections in my business notes today: At the time, I thought I’d created a competitive advantage. Years later, I discovered this system was called Cornell Notes , and it was invented in the 1950s. (Why hadn’t anyone ever told me about Cornell Notes?) Some notes about notes For all the importance we place on education, schools don’t teach us how to learn, and research has confirmed we aren’t very good at it. College freshmen capture only 11% of the major themes covered in lectures , so maybe my “system” gave me a bit of an advantage. Now technology has made this advantage available to anyone who wants it. I’ve replaced hundreds of binders with bibliographies in the back of each one with Evernote , an app that I live in and for which I am the passionate SVP of Marketing. Instead of inserting footnotes, now I let machine learning alert me to other notes with content related to what I’m working on. I still prefer to write by hand because I find typing leads to transcribing rather than understanding, but instead of searching for my shorthand symbols, optical character recognition finds words in my handwritten notes. Notes were my last daily task to be disrupted by technology, but new pen technologies combine the pen and paper experience with the digital benefits of saving, searching, and sharing. My approach isn’t for everyone, and part of the reason that there’s no class on learning is that we all do it differently. Richard Branson takes prolific notes on virtually any piece of paper nearby, including menus and napkins. Mark Twain carried a pocket notebook everywhere he went, and Stephen Colbert records his thoughts in Evernote . You’ll have to experiment to discover what works best for you, but some common principles underlie most approaches: If you want to achieve something, make a note of it — Students who take notes are seven times more successful than those who don’t, and people with written goals are almost twice as likely to accomplish them . Achieving a few of your goals will quickly erase any embarrassment about carrying around a notebook or pulling out a phone to take a note. Revisit and revise —Unfortunately, the human brain is made to forget and approximately 40 percent of what you hear is gone within 20 minutes; two-thirds thirds is gone at the end of one day. Consistently revisiting your ideas allows you to evolve them with new content. You never know where your next big idea will come from, but nothing will come from a lost idea. Train your brain —No one I respect has ever judged me for capturing something they said or for being curious. In fact, learning helps you grow brain cells. So experiment to find your way of capturing ideas (mind mapping, outlining, taking photographs, bullets, etc.) and keep doing it. My note-taking has improved more than my hair has in the last 15 years. Sticking to these fundamentals allowed me to adapt to new needs and continue to do things beyond anyone’s expectations. Today, my goal isn’t retention of facts like it was in school, but instead, to communicate my own ideas. I spend a lot of my day in meetings with tons of data and little time to reflect on them. By listening for what matters, I can capture, organize and synthesize thoughts in real time so that I can connect projects my team is working on to one another, just as I did in my classes. I still take notes in virtually every interaction, but now the purpose is to ensure that I recall what we need to do, not what somebody else already did. I’m always looking for ways to learn more about how to make the most of my ideas, so please share in the comments below!

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Vacations: Where Productivity Takes an Unexpected Turn", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/vacations-where-productivity-takes-an-unexpected-turn/", "abstract": "Do you ever find yourself talking about a scene in a movie, only to forget the name of the movie midway through your sentence? The way our brains work is both remarkable and mysterious. One minute, we’re processing massive amounts of data like a machine. Next, we’re struggling to remember our best friend’s birthday. There’s so much about the brain we don’t understand. But what we are learning is that like machines, in order for us to achieve sustained levels of wellness and productivity, our brains need to be refueled, recharged, and properly cared for. Our brains need to take a vacation. Vacation deprivation a health risk? The health benefits of taking vacations is becoming more well-documented and better understood. Longer breaks are not only beneficial, but critical to our health and well-being. Francine Lederer , a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles, points out that “just as small breaks improve concentration, long breaks replenish job performance. Vacation deprivation increases mistakes and resentment at co-workers…The impact that taking a vacation has on one’s mental health is profound.” This may come as welcome news to those of us feeling a little burned out from deadlines and deliverables—news almost as exciting as reports of the health benefits of chocolate . Tim Kreider, an essayist for the The New York Time s writes, “Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets.” Perhaps these health benefits may be enough to encourage many of us to change our ‘work-harder-faster-and-more’ mentality. Vacations can be productive If the health and wellness argument isn’t strong enough to convince some of us to go ahead and book that overdue vacation to Rio, perhaps the productivity argument might work. It turns out that by giving your brain a break, you can increase productivity, replenish your attention, and foster creativity. Why is this? The fact is—our brain never really stops working. A recent article published in the Scientific American states, “Some studies have demonstrated that the mind obliquely solves tough problems while daydreaming—an experience many people have had while taking a shower.” Daydreaming your brain taking a ‘virtual vacation’—turning the focus away from regular tasks and obligations. Taking our focus off of a situation often helps us explore new perspectives. Tim Kreider writes, “The space and quiet that idleness provides is a necessary condition for standing back from life and seeing it whole, for making unexpected connections and waiting for the wild summer lightning strikes of inspiration—it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.” Not everyone agrees, but things are changing This concept of carving out time from work to vacate and rest is more acceptable in some countries than in others. In many European countries, shops and cafes unapologetically hang “We’re Closed” signs up during the entire month of August. In America, Canada, Japan and Hong Kong workers average 10 days off each year —a stark contrast to the over 20 days of mandatory, paid vacation in the European Union. Despite the reported health and economic benefits and the growing trend among companies to offer unlimited, paid vacations, ‘vacation-shaming’ is more prevalent than you might expect. Even views on taking time off during the workday to rest vary across the globe. In China, resting your head on your desk after lunch is both acceptable and commonplace. Spain, Mexico, and a few other countries structure their days around citywide naps, referred to as siestas. For those of us living in the U.S, daily naps at the office would likely be a topic of concern in our next performance review. But, attitudes appear to be changing. There are a growing number of books and apps being developed to help people carve out time to rest. The Productivity Project chronicles one man’s year of productivity experiments, to discover such things as the effects of sleep deprivation on productivity. Deep Work is a compilation of best practices, including taking regular retreats away from everyday responsibilities. Apps such as iRelax Soundscapes transport us to virtual islands and rainforests, while Sleep Cycle helps monitor the quantity and quality of your daily rhythms of rest. Vacations that leave you feeling more refreshed How do we avoid taking vacations where we come back feeling more exhausted than refreshed? Of course, there’s no guarantee we’ll come back from every vacation bursting with breakthrough ideas, but perhaps the following tips may help: Plan different types vacations – There are many different flavors of vacation. Ask yourself, what kind of vacation will give you the rest you need right now. A cruise? A cycling adventure? A prayer or meditation retreat? Come up with creative challenges – Create  a fun challenge for yourself. I know a friend who stops by the local grocery store to snap a photo of bags of Cheetos upon arriving in a different country. What about ‘selfies’ of your favorite rubber ducky or plush elephant in different locations? Limit online activities – Bring an e-reader with only books on it. Bring an SLR camera to take photos to avoid incessant phone notifications. Set up an out-of-office reply on your email account. Check unread emails once a day or avoid checking emails altogether—whatever works best for you. Avoid social media – Use apps like Glympse or Find My Friends to automate location notifications and avoid posting daily status updates. Consider meeting up with friends at your destination for some real face-time. Get organized Make a ‘must-do’ and ‘nice-to-do’ list of places you’d like to visit or explore. Use Google Maps to create custom walking tours . Snap photos of outfits you can wear on your trip, and include them in your packing list.", "date": "2016-06-15,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Create a Spark File With Evernote", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-to-create-a-spark-file-with-evernote/", "abstract": "On the Evernote blog, creativity is a constant theme. The very nature of creativity—how we find it, capture it, save it, and how we use it, has been a persistent narrative of many of our posts. It has defined topics ranging from authors and writers to filmmakers and designers . The fascinating takeaway from these dialogues is that the fundamental search for understanding how ideas work has implications far beyond the note. Last week, we explored the origins of the spark file as a tool for capturing and managing your ever-evolving ideas. We’d like to show you some examples to help you create a spark file in Evernote. Getting started A spark file is easy to start. Just create a new note. Jot down your ideas in the note, everywhere you get an idea. Be prepared to capture ideas whether you’re using a mobile device or at the office—wherever the moment strikes you. Update your notes when new concepts, ideas, and thoughts enter your mind. 1. Clip, email, and connect. It only takes an instant to get ideas into your spark file using any one of the following methods: Web Clipper to capture material from the web directly into Evernote. You may find something that piques your interest at a time when you have no time to read it. Clip it right into Evernote, and it’ll appear in context when you search for related ideas. Email. Whip open your email and send a note to yourself. Evernote provides you with a special email address just for that. Then, find all your old ideas and send them to Evernote. Drive right in. Now, your ideas can seamlessly move between Evernote and Google Drive. Test-drive the beta now >> 2. Record audio ideas. When an idea comes to your head, and you aren’t able to write it down, use the recording feature. Then, play it back later when you need it. 3. Take a picture. Sometimes snapping a picture in Evernote is the perfect way to capture an inspiration. And remember, if you add tags to your photos, you can index them easier, and find any photo you’re thinking about in seconds. 4. Read what you’ve written. Often. Spark files are designed as a safe place for your ideas, but they’re not a place for ideas to go to die. Read your spark file often. Something that didn’t make sense two years ago may have just been ahead of its time. Or it may have been a puzzle piece in solving a larger problem. As you review your spark file, you might find an idea that ignites a new chapter in your life. Pro Tip: Set a reminder to review your ideas weekly or monthly. 5. Chance favors connectivity. Use your spark file to join unrelated ideas, even when they occurred weeks or even years apart. Author Steven Johnson calls this concept “the slow hunch” — a series of ideas that evolve over time, not in a single moment of clarity. 6. Create connected systems. Often, when you’re dealing with hunches, you need a system to help connect with ideas, stumble upon new information, and rediscover your old musings and thoughts. We all deal with an always-on, connected world that requires us to rethink how we find new ideas. Making connections through search and context is what Evernote does, and what makes Evernote the perfect home for unrelated, unstructured ideas. You may forget what flights of fancy or ethereal inspirations you’ve had, but Evernote never does. 7. Share with colleagues and friends. Innovation is often discovered when we start connecting to people. The ability to tap into shared knowledge with colleagues helps bridge the gap between forgetting and creating. Scientific and creative innovation has largely been driven by those who choose to interact and share their thoughts with others. With Evernote, you can share your spark file with a colleague, or create a shared group note that can be updated daily, weekly, or monthly. Let the ideas and concepts flow! So go ahead. Light a spark. Let Evernote help you fan the flame. Not every idea will turn into a work of genius, but every idea has the potential to start one. And Evernote will be ready to serve it up to you when you’re ready. How are you building and updating your spark file with Evernote?

Today, we’re connecting Evernote’s business card scanning features to Salesforce. This is our most-requested feature from sales teams using Evernote Business, and an example of how a small but truly useful innovation can have a big impact on daily work. Business cards—dealing with the modern relic Let’s face it: business cards are problematic. They’re easy to lose in ones or twos, and when they accumulate, they quickly become hard to manage. In addition, the problem with cards is that we don’t usually get to them until much later, often at the expense of lost opportunities. When we do eventually remember them, we need to set aside time to either file them or manually input all the details into a database. For something so simple as a card, there sure is a lot of accompanying disorder. Evernote’s updated business card scanner lets you get those new contacts into Salesforce immediately, so you can keep your attention on the important parts of your sales funnel—converting leads to opportunities and closing deals. From card to CRM in under a minute Once you’ve connected your Salesforce account with Evernote , simply take a picture of a business card in Evernote on your iPhone or iPad.* Our highly accurate optical character recognition turns physical business cards into editable business card notes. You then have the option to save the contact details on Salesforce as either a ‘Lead’ or ‘Contact’. Evernote also checks for existing email entries in Salesforce to avoid creating duplicates. That’s it. No more lost cards, no more bulk. The entire process from scanning a business card to creating or updating an entry in Salesforce needs less than a minute, which means you can get to work while you’re still on the trade show floor. Forget about renting expensive scanners and fighting over which lead belongs to whom. With your smartphone and an Evernote Business account, never let a sales opportunity run cold again. Tip: Works with ScanSnap and Android too You can of course also scan your business cards into Evernote using a Fujitsu ScanSnap Evernote Edition scanner or your Android phone. Once they are in Evernote, go to any business card note in Evernote Web , click the ‘Share’ button, then select the record type you’d like to create in Salesforce. *Availability To use the integration, you will need an Evernote Business account and Salesforce Enterprise or higher. Business card scanning integration with Salesforce is currently available on Evernote Web and coming very soon to iOS, Windows, and Mac.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "8 Ways to Begin Your Genealogy Journey Using Evernote", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/8-ways-to-begin-your-genealogy-journey/", "abstract": "Years ago, Kerry Scott was a 21-year-old woman who had just moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She knew no one in the area. Or so she thought. One day, she got a mysterious letter. A 90-year-old relative had written to Kerry to tell her she wasn’t alone at all. She had many relatives in the area, but she needed to visit local graveyards to find them. Intrigued, Kerry sought out this elderly correspondent. Sadly, Kerry discovered that the old woman had passed away shortly after writing her. Kerry picked up the clues her late relative had left her and visited one of the cemeteries listed in the letter. The people there had a surprise for her—generations of family members and packets of documents belonging to them. Thus began her love of genealogy, a lifelong quest to discover her roots, and then later, to help others find theirs. Today, Kerry is the author of How to Use Evernote for Genealogy and a prolific blogger, genealogist, and instructor at Family Tree University. Teaching and offering assistance to those beginning their genealogical quests, she developed a methodology for getting started: 1. Start Where You Are. Most genealogists already have a mountain of papers. Don’t try to digitize everything you have by putting it in Evernote all at once. That will prove time-consuming and won’t advance your search. But the minute you get new material, enter it into Evernote. “As I work on each branch of the family,” Kerry explained, “I put documents related to each person in a folder related to the family line to which the person belongs.” 2. Develop the discipline to use Evernote. Evernote is an incredibly powerful tool for genealogists, but it’s only as good as what you put into it. Using it consistently for research is key to success with it. Kerry understands how family researchers work, and how easily information can get out of hand. Information sources are easily lost in stacks of paper. “Source citations are very important in genealogy,” Kerry said. “We have to be able to trace where we found each piece of information, so use Evernote Web Clipper instead of a printer because Evernote automatically provides URLs that help you craft your source citations.” 3. Determine your structure. Evernote gives you many options to use it in ways that make sense to you, so think about how you want to organize. Kerry organizes Evernote the same way she uses paper files. “Everybody has two sides to their family,” she said, “and so I had two cabinets. Inside each cabinet were four drawers. Each drawer represented a great-grandparent. We all have eight great-grandparents, and most people start their genealogical search there. We call these ‘the Eight Greats.’ For someone who organizes their stuff that way, using notebooks and stacks is the closest to what you’re used to.” Some people, she conceded, organize their searches differently. “Some want to put everyone who has the same last name together in a binder. Or they keep separate files containing birth certificates or marriage certificates. It depends on what you’re trying to find. For people who prefer that type of organization, tags are a great resource .” 4. Use Evernote for everything. Kerry says that the more she put into Evernote, the more useful it became. “I get frustrated when people refer to it as a note-taking app,” she said. “That’s just a tiny fraction of what it can do.” She related a story of a time she took a photograph of a spoon with a date engraved on it and put it in Evernote. She didn’t know how the spoon would fit into her search. Years later, she put in a scan of an old newspaper article, and Evernote instantly related the file to the photo of the mysterious spoon she had taken and forgotten about. Evernote found a long-lost relative’s family reunion. “There’s no way the human brain can do that,” she says. 5. Use Evernote in other aspects of your life. You’ll get used to using Evernote much faster if you make it your constant companion. Kerry keeps everything from grocery lists to owners’ manuals in Evernote. She scans her kids’ drawings into Evernote, as well, to keep a running log of her life. “Future genealogists will thank you for it,” Kerry said. “We spend so much time chasing dead people, but we forget—someday, we’ll be the dead people and others will be researching us.” She reports that she’s spent hundreds of dollars and flown around the world in search of tiny snippets of documents like school records. “What I wouldn’t give to have a shopping list or a laundry ticket from an ancestor,” Kerry mused. “It turns out that it’s the minutia of our lives is what gives us the greatest glimpses into the way we live.” “We spend so much time chasing dead people, but we forget—someday, we’ll be the dead people and others will be researching us.” -Kerry Scott 6. Let the indexing work for you. “We get so many documents when we are involved with genealogy, we will never live long enough to index them all,” Kerry says, with a touch of the humor that permeates her blog . “Scanning every document and photo and letting Evernote index it all for you is mind blowing.” Whether it’s an immigration certificate, a picture of a headstone, a map, or a letter, Evernote’s text recognition technology can read the words and group similar items together in seconds. “If you use Evernote for nothing else,” Kerry advises, “use it for indexing.” 7. Use the audio recorder. The day you begin the search for your roots, Kerry advised, start with the Evernote audio recorder and interview relatives you already know. “Audio is great,” she says. “Sometimes, people don’t like having someone taking notes when they talk. With Evernote, you can be discreet; just put the phone down and let them talk.” (Evernote recommends obtaining permission before making audio recordings. –ed.) The most important thing, is, talk to relatives you have while they’re still here.” Later, Kerry said, you can tag the files according to your system, and they’ll pop up later during a search. 8. Use the camera. It may be difficult to get relatives to part with precious family documents, even long enough to have them copied or scanned. “There is no way your aunt is going to let you take the 150-year-old family Bible to the copy place,” Kerry laughed. “But now you have a scanner in your phone with the camera features in Evernote. It’s the fastest and most efficient way to gather old pictures, documents, anything that could be a clue.” Kerry, who teaches Genealogy at Family Tree University , is a strong proponent of using emerging technology for a search for family roots. DNA testing has put a tremendous amount of information into people’s hands, and they’re discovering relatives that might have escaped a historical paper trail altogether. “You get an overwhelming number of cousins,” Kerry said. “It’s impossible to figure out how they’re related to you unless you can index them. There might be one little clue from years ago and  one from yesterday. There’s no way I can relate them but Evernote helps link these things together and see patterns. You couldn’t have created a better tool for genealogists if you’d set out to do that.” Readers! You can win a copy of Kerry’s book, How to Use Evernote for Genealogy.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "5 Reasons to Get Evernote on Your Desktop", "author": ["Jesse Day"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/5-reasons-to-get-evernote-on-your-desktop/", "abstract": "There are millions of people out there who only use Evernote on their phone. And that’s fine. We’re overjoyed that so many of you rely on the mobile app to capture your thoughts and stay organized. But the truth is, when we dreamed up Evernote, we had something more in mind. Evernote syncs notes between devices. That’s kind of its thing. We want you to have everything that’s important to you at your fingertips no matter where you are or what you’re doing. When you don’t have to worry about where you saved things, you can be more productive. Then you can focus on the creative, personal, or professional task at hand. That’s one reason to get Evernote on your computer. But that’s not all. There are also some really cool features that are only available on desktop, or are just better on the big screen. Here are a few things you might not know you can do with Evernote on your computer: 1. Attach documents Most people have a whole bunch of important documents in random folders on their desktop. This works up to a point, but it falls apart when you get too busy to be vigilant with your filing. There is an answer! Drag important documents into Evernote so you can keep them in context with related notes. You can even draw and write on PDFs to call attention to the important bits. Best of all, you’ll be able to access these documents anywhere you have Evernote installed, like on your phone. Organize with tables Tables are a useful way to structure information. A lot of people use them to visually categorize notes and to-do lists. They’re also great for project management. Designers at Evernote love to use tables to organize images with contextually relevant notes and comments. Start playing around with tables and see how much clearer your notes become. 3. Present ideas The reality is that a lot of work is “work in progress.” Spending hours formatting ideas into presentations can be a huge waste of time. Sometimes you just want to have something you can point to that will facilitate a conversation. Evernote’s presentation feature does the grunt work for you. Throw your talking points, charts, and images into a note and then hit the presentation icon . Your note will instantly be formatted into a clean, clutter-free presentation. Clip articles from the web When you find a gem online, you should keep it. The web changes constantly; don’t trust the internet to be the same tomorrow. Add the Web Clipper extension to your browser and you can clip articles, recipes, confirmations and more from the web. You can clip articles with your phone too, but the desktop clipper gives you the ability to save as a simplified article, which cuts all the ads from the page. You can also save the full page or just a bookmark. 5. Sync your notes This isn’t technically something you can only do on desktop, but it does take two (or more) to tango. Pause for a moment and imagine: All the important information you collect and develop on your computer is available on your phone. Every time a thought pops into your head, wherever you are, you can just open your notes and update them. Whenever you have a new idea you can write or record it to Evernote on your phone, and it will be there for you next time you’re on your computer. It’s like a never ending stream of productive awesomeness. It gives us chills. If you haven’t already, go download the free Evernote for desktop and give it a try.", "date": "2016-08-4,"},

In this series, we’ll spotlight employees and the clever and creative ways they use the product! Get some inspiration from Evernote insiders. Monica Chua loves whiteboards. She relies on them to illustrate even her everyday speech, because to her, communications and visuals are inextricably linked. As a director of product marketing for Evernote, she often has a difficult time explaining to people on the outside what product marketing is. “People don’t understand it,” she laughs. “They don’t know the difference between product management and product marketing. So I….” she trails off and instead reaches for a dry erase marker that’s always within her reach. On the whiteboard, she sketches out the customer’s journey from discovering the product to buying and using it. Monica Chua, Director of Product Marketing “I’m a very visual person, and to break down concepts or to create a vision for a marketing plan or project strategy, I need to sketch it on a whiteboard or put it on paper,” she says. “So using Evernote to take pictures of all my drawings and handwritten notes is my favorite thing.” Monica is pragmatic about her “sketchy” communication style. She sees illustrations as an extension of her own speech that’s automatically ready for collaboration and discussion. Ideas can move out of the meeting room and out into the world effortlessly. “Drawing and sending optimized photos is the best way for me to help others understand what we’re doing,” she said. “I put all my drawings in shared notebooks so others can see what we’re talking about and get a visual understanding of it, even if they didn’t hear our discussion.” Monica has tapped into one of the most useful business applications in Evernote. “Others can annotate it,” she says. “Everyone can see the annotations, and all the other projects that are related to it are in the same notebook—that notebook becomes the one source of truth.” Monica’s job requires a lot of research, and she has to be able to keep it accessible. She’s especially enthusiastic about using Evernote to help with research online. “If there’s an article on a market segment I’m trying to understand, I save it to Evernote with Web Clipper.” The material you clip stays in Evernote, even if the website comes down, so you always have a record of what was once there. That’s really useful.” Monica’s tips: Use Command+J on a Mac. That command is a quick switcher that lets you  search anything really quickly. Let the camera do the work . Evernote takes photos without you having to push a button. Just point the Evernote camera at the document you want to photograph, and Evernote will automatically detect it and capture the image. It will then convert it into a usable document, and you don’t have to do a thing. Trust Search. If you’re not an organizer, just let search do the work. It’s easier than trying to force everything into traditional files. I used to think I had to organize everything, but if I let go of that and just trust search, I’ll be able to find it faster without spending time on organization. I make sure my notes are tagged by topic, or I’ll put a keyword in there that I know will come up. I still use notebooks when I work with a group because others might not understand or know the search term, but when I’m just working for myself, I don’t even bother with trying to organize it. It’s so liberating.", "date": "2016-07-29,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Improve Your Note-Taking with These 3 Tips", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/improve-your-note-taking-with-these-3-tips/", "abstract": "As a student in a lecture, how many times have you been in the middle of transcribing a sentence when the professor switches to the next slide? Students today face the challenge of managing an overwhelming amount of information, tools, and distractions. While it would be logical to think that the goal of a good student would be to capture all the facts, theories, and data thrown your way, the key to successful note-taking is remembering the important things, and not remembering everything. (For the latter—there’s Evernote.) Here are three tips to help you separate the important from the trivial so you can get the most out of your studies. 1. Pick out the main ideas One of the pitfalls of note-taking is that it is a passive activity. Our hands might be scribbling furiously, but in an effort to capture everything, our minds focus on the task of transcribing more than the task of understanding what’s important. Tip: Listen actively to the lecture and identify key phrases, ideas, and takeaway points. When you hear something you’ll need to remember, jot down keywords to serve as reminders. If there were points you found especially significant or if the lecturer says something you don’t understand, annotate these with an “!” (exclamation mark) so you can easily identify and revisit them later. The process of jotting shorter main ideas helps your brain to process the information you just heard. Because you aren’t physically able to write down every word in the lecture, you must reformat the information in a concise and meaningful way. Whatever you write down using this  technique is already more effective than listening and writing at the same time, because you’re already thinking about what the lecturer said. 2. Shorthand techniques Shorthand (or stenographic) techniques consist of abbreviated symbols, letters, or pen strokes. Some form of shorthand has been used for centuries to conceal important messages from unintended eyes. However, they’re also a great way of capturing information quickly. There are many forms of shorthand , and, depending on how similar they are to modern writing conventions, they can be quite difficult to learn. Instead of trying to learn an entire shorthand method, try adopting certain techniques in your note-taking. You are probably already familiar with some of them, such as using “ w/” to represent with . Take that concept one step further and think of words or patterns you commonly see or use. For example, in English and many Latin languages, the suffix –tion occurs frequently, especially in academic contexts. Words like conversion , mutation , and relation can be shortened consistently. You can use a “.” (period or full-stop) to abbreviate the suffix. conversion » convers. mutation » mutat. You can employ similar techniques to verbs. Try using an apostrophe (‘) to denote a verb in the past. converted » convert’ mutated » mutat’ Tip: Remember that the ultimate goal of shorthand is to capture information faster. There is no correct or standard way to do it, so feel free to experiment with variations that work best for you. After trying out various abbreviations, Some note-takers use é (e-acute) to represent the word before and è (e-grave) to represent the word after . The infection cleared up after the application of the treatment. » Infect. clear’ è applicat. of treatment. Even if you use just one or two shorthand techniques, you’ll find that you can cut down on the amount you have to write. 3. Limit yourself When it comes to reviewing your notes, one of the most useful techniques is the practice of preparing a review card . Limiting the space you have to write your notes on is a way of filtering through the massive amounts of information you must process. It forces your brain to be selective and prioritize information. Tip: If you need to review your notes from a previous lecture or chapter, try creating your own review cards using index cards or Post-it® Notes . When filling these cards out, there’s no need to write down things you already know. Your cards should only contain concepts and ideas from your notes that are still unfamiliar to you. Once you’re done, everything you need to study more in depth will already be on your cards.", "date": "2016-08-10,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Drawing Inspiration from da Vinci", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/drawing-inspiration-from-da-vinci/", "abstract": "This post is part of an ongoing series, “Taking Note,” which outlines the history and styles of note-taking. In this series, we explore how taking notes can improve your creativity and all the work you set out to accomplish. For many of us, inspiration begins with a simple sketch. Leonardo da Vinci, the most inspirational of all Renaissance figures, imagined the possibility of everything from flight to robotics. It was drawing and sketching that represented the most pivotal tools he used to bring those imaginings to life. Earlier in this series, we tackled some of his note-taking styles that are easily adaptable in today’s digital world. But, we reserved some of his most vital skills for a post all its own— drawing, sketching, and mind mapping. Here are some ways you can draw inspiration from one of our greatest minds. Draw Your Inspiration As early as 1505, da Vinci drew inspiration—mainly from birds—and formulated ideas into a notebook devoted to the study of flight. His Codex on the Flight of Birds contained over 30,000 words and 500 sketches that traced fundamentals that would eventually apply to the world’s first flying machine. A page from da Vinci’s notes—his idea for a helicopter. From The New York Public Library That notebook remains one of the most ground-breaking and important documents ever written about flight. It’s a treatise that not only planted the seeds of how man would fly, but also outlined principles of propulsion that paved the way for space travel. The notebook also contained concepts for such ‘futuristic’ ideas as the parachute, helicopter, and glider. Many of the lessons that da Vinci drew from his drawing can be incorporated into our life and help bolster our personal and professional pursuits. Draw from real life. Da Vinci saw great potential in the nature around him. Birds helped him see the possibility of flight, but he also honed skills drawing moving objects like water and groups of people. Key into the subtleties of motion. The chaos and disorder of moving things teach us how to work with both the hand and mind, and to make strategic choices about what to draw. Artwork, much like real life work, is all about selectivity. Pay attention to detail. Da Vinci was one of the first to map the anatomy of the human body with complex and intricate drawings. In fact, some of these drawings are still used today in medical texts. His drawings on the human skull and the spinal column are still considered accurate and were hundreds of years ahead of their time. Tap your intuition. Da Vinci had an innate understanding of form and function. A talented sculptor and draftsman, he had an ability to tap his intuitive understanding of the human form and connect his observations to anatomic mechanics. Dabble in other areas. At the same moments he was tackling the codex on flight in 1505, da Vinci was also working on painting his iconic Mona Lisa. Draw many times. Practice makes perfect, and in drawing, it takes many tries to get something right. Da Vinci studied other master artists, and created many iterations of his sketches until he was satisfied. da Vinci’s sketches and notes captured ideas that were hundreds of years ahead of their time. From The New York Public Library Mind Map Your World In today’s world, we can take a cue from da Vinci’s incessant need to draw to understand his world. Use mind maps to capture ideas, set personal or professional goals, set daily, weekly, or monthly plans, and other thought cataloging. Rather than writing them down point-by-point, try doodling or sketching them out. Like da Vinci, you may be surprised at what develops. Mind maps may be the most creatively powerful note-taking format. Traditionally, they work well on paper, but with digital tools today like Evernote, it’s possible to adopt a flexible framework that embraces digital, paper-based systems (or, both together). Mind maps favor the creative and visual right-brain thinkers, and that’s probably why da Vinci was so successful. His note-taking combined the worlds of art and science, logic and imagination and created a super connected way of whole-brain thinking. It enhanced his ability to learn, and it also has lessons to all of us about how we acquire and keep knowledge at the same time as honing in on our creative aspirations and ideas. You don’t need to be a creative genius or an illustrious painter to carry on da Vinci’s note-taking legacy. You just have to do what he did every day—connect all your ideas, thoughts, observations, and sketches to your note-taking world. He did it using a unique ‘tree-branch’ structure (which evokes the traditional mind map), but he also referenced sketches with detailed notes to bring them all together. By looking at his notes, da Vinci was able to make instant connections visually. Here are some tips for mind-mapping you can do on your own: So many possibilities. Start with a blank sheet of paper or a Moleskine notebook . Flip the page horizontally for premium workspace. Start with the main idea. At the center of the page, jot down the central theme of your work. A keyword or short sentence will do. Branches, twigs, and leaves bear fruit. Your main theme creates a hub from which branches flow, representing different concepts and ideas. You can illustrate the branches with annotations, images, keywords, or shorthand. It’s all about the lines. Use thicker lines to represent more important ideas and thinner lines that call out sub-points. Symbols like bullet points also help, as do colors or highlights. Be creative . Use your own personal flair and style to link your ideas to the main theme. If that is original sketches, diagrams, or smiley faces— then go for it. Structure is key. When you’re reviewing your mind map later, you want to identify the material in a cohesive way. Think of a structure that works for you that is clear, easy to understand, and shows information in a hierarchy, like most important to least important.", "date": "2016-08-11,"},

But lectures can go too fast, you can get too many handouts and drawings. Even when you’re trying to do your best, you might miss something important. Here are four ways to improve your note-taking with Evernote Premium: Take notes like a pro. Set up class notebooks, or label notes with tags or just search for keywords. Evernote syncs across your devices. So even if your laptop’s battery is dead, you can write and find every note on your other devices, or log into your web account from any computer. Record the lecture: With Evernote Premium, you can record a lecture and save it in Evernote, and play it back later. Or share it with someone who missed class. Capture every idea: Use your device’s camera to scan handouts, take pictures of dry erase boards and presentations, and put it in an Evernote notebook so you’ll know where to find it quickly. Scan handwriting: Evernote scans and reads handwriting, so even sticky notes and sketch pads become searchable.", "date": "2016-08-16,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Evernote Employee Inspiration: Meet the Idea Man, “Mr. Evernote”", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/meet-the-idea-man-mr-evernote/", "abstract": "In this series, we spotlight employees and the clever and creative ways they use the product! Get some inspiration from Evernote insiders. In a way, Josh Zerkel is “Mr. Evernote.” As head of the Evernote Community and Certified Consultant programs, it’s Josh’s job to spread the word about Evernote to groups around the world, and he designs programs to bring fans together to meet and learn from each other. It’s the perfect job for him. He’s such an organization expert that people who design Evernote come to him to learn new ways of using the product. In turn, Josh never stops thinking up and sharing innovative ideas. Josh loves burgers so much he keeps a guide to the best hamburgers in the world in Evernote. A connoisseur’s guide using Evernote “I’m a bit of a foodie, and I love to travel,” Josh says. “I keep lists of every place I’d like to eat, anywhere in the world. I’m always looking at food resources and researching restaurants. It doesn’t matter where in the world they are. I’ll find a way to get there someday. And when I do, I’ll be ready.” Josh uses Web Clipper to pull together as much information about restaurants as he can, then merges all of the clippings together into a single note. That way, when he travels, he has a ready-made, personalized restaurant guide on his phone. “When I’m ready to go, I drag the notebook for that city into my Evernote shortcuts, so the information is front and center,” he adds. “That’s a huge time-saver.” Sharing the love…through notebooks But Josh doesn’t keep his curated lists to himself. Since his job (and his passion) is to evangelize Evernote, he sends his notebooks to friends and acquaintances who want them. “I’ve lived in San Francisco for a long time, and I’ve come to know the city well. I have a note that I call Josh’s Picks of favorite restaurants, activities, and things to do in San Francisco ready to go so that I can share it easily. I’m a burger aficionado, so I have a list of favorite burger places organized by price point.” Burger restaurants organized by price point? What kind of person organizes to that level? A Certified Professional Organizer (CPO) does, and that’s how Josh came to Evernote in the first place. He was the owner of Custom Living Solutions—a company that worked with small businesses on productivity and organization, systems for managing time, tasks and organization. “That’s how I ended up at Evernote,” Josh relates. “I was a customer first. After awhile, I became the first Evernote ambassador, and I went around and taught people cool ways to use it. The app became a core part of my business. Eventually, I wrote a couple of books about Evernote. Josh’s pro tip: Keep all of your tasks in one long list. Evernote lets you put a checkbox next to each item, so you can mark it when it’s complete. Don’t go into details, just jot down the task. If you need more details to complete the task, you can add note links to your list. For example, if you need to send someone else to do some grocery shopping, just write a checklist and send it in Evernote. If a significant other isn’t sure which brands to buy, link the list item to a note containing photos of the products you can collect over time. That way, you’ll never get the wrong brand, size, or product again. Your list stays clean and simple, but all the details are only one click away. Perspective and gratitude Josh’s natural tendencies to organize himself and others around him has parlayed into a successful career that has taken him all over the world and made him one of the world’s premiere Evernote experts. It isn’t lost on him that he’s been very lucky, and has a lot to be thankful for. And to keep track of just how much, Josh, of course, turns to Evernote. “I use Evernote to keep my gratitude journal,” he says. “At the end of each day, I write down things that went well or things that I’m thankful for. It’s the last thing I look at before I go to sleep. It helps to put my life in perspective.” Another thing that helps Josh stay productive all day is to collect things in Evernote that bring him joy. He uses either the Web Clipper or the email function to keep a note full of pictures of cute baby animals. “It’s proven that it reduces stress when you look at them,” Josh added. “So I send the note to people who’re stressed out. They make people smile.” Josh encourages all customers to use Evernote for business and for fun.  “Anyone can start a similar note,” Josh advises. “Keep an archive of whatever makes you happy, and go to it whenever you need a pick-me-up. Aside from all your work and study and all the things that keep you busy and productive, Evernote can also be your Happy Place.”", "date": "2016-08-18,"},

They specialize in digital productivity workflows for businesses and individuals. Today, the Evernote Community team talks to Stacey Harmon, Principal of Harmon Enterprises and Evernote Certified Consultant, about what it takes to turn your passion into a business. Evernote: You’ve developed a thriving network in Austin. How did you begin, and get you to the point you are at now? Stacey: When I moved to Austin in 2013, I was very aware of how strong the Evernote community already was here. At the time, I was an Evernote Ambassador (now an Evernote Certified Consultant ), and there were three other Evernote Ambassadors in Austin. I reached out to them. It was great to geek out with people who were as excited about Evernote as I was. I’m also lucky that one of the Evernote offices is in Austin. I connected with the people there as soon as I got to Austin. I was also interested in bringing together and growing the Evernote Austin user community. After hosting a couple of happy hour events at the Evernote Austin office, I found Meetup.com. This channel that helped me build a community of 150 passionate Evernote customers, and we’re still growing. Not only have I met enthusiastic people in the area who care about organization and productivity, but I also met fellow Evernote enthusiast and Community Leader Kristi Willis, who became my co-author of our book, Untethered with Evernote . Being able to interact with other people in the Evernote Community has been a huge help at times when I need to talk through challenges or ask questions. We like to bounce ideas off each other and collect inspiration from shared experiences. It’s a great help to be able to network with peers. Evernote: Do you have any strategies for others who’d like to grow the Evernote Community? Stacey: Start by networking in your area. It’s helpful to getting together to talk, present, or collaborate. If you’re online, try out different platforms to grow your Evernote network. I had gone through a couple of avenues before I found meetup.com. Once I found the right platform, it was much easier to boost my local visibility and create exciting opportunities for the local Evernote community. Also, reach out to other groups or individuals who share your similar interests. Offer to do a presentation on how Evernote is an asset to their niche or interest. And, make use of the access you have as an Evernote Certified Consultant to the Evernote team. While planning training for a large client, the Evernote team was great in helping me collect all the information that I needed. Evernote: What strategies can you offer to others who are trying to grow their professional community? Stacey: As an Evernote Certified Consultant, I’m endorsed by Evernote. This endorsement is great both visually on my website and in proposals for potential new clients. Being recognized by Evernote provides an advantage and presents new business opportunities that I might not otherwise have. And, being an Evernote Certified Consultant gives prospects, clients, and the public confidence that I’m fluent in Evernote. Evernote: What would you say are the top tips for success as an Evernote Certified Consultant? Stacey: First, it’s important to decide what your consulting business is going after—new Evernote customers or existing Evernote ones. Depending on which you go with, the work can be very different. With new customers, I focus mostly on training. With existing customers, I focus more on workflow consulting and elevation of Evernote skills. Knowing who your customer base is impacts your marketing, proposal generation, and the work you do. Next, put as much effort as you can into creating great content. The more great content you put out there, the more likely it is to be discovered and shared by new customers, clients, and partners. Video is great too. I’d say that 70 percent of my bookings come from people who have never even spoken or emailed me—they have only seen my videos. Video has become an outstanding way for me to articulate my perspective and people feel like they know me before they ever hire me. Finally, answer the phone. I come from a real estate background, and one of the key things I learned is that the agent who sells the house is often the first one with whom the prospect speaks with Evernote: What advice do you have for new Evernote Certified Consultants? Stacey: Track your time. Before I started being meticulous about clocking, I gave away so much time. FreshBooks is an essential tool that allows me to do that and it integrates seamlessly with my billing. Also, make sure you have a testimonial strategy. Set expectations up front with customers about seeking recommendations so you can build upon your successes. And, don’t be shy about asking those who compliment your content online or via email if you can use it as a testimonial. If you have a prepared strategy about getting these comments onto LinkedIn and on your website, it helps to reap financial rewards from all the time and energy that you’ve spent giving away content.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "6 Study Tips from the Winner of Evernote’s Twitter Sweepstakes", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/6-study-tips-from-twitter-sweepstakes-winner/", "abstract": "When Jonathan Copeland, a second year student at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, was selected as the winner of Evernote’s Twitter Back to School Sweepstakes , we knew we’d found a treasure trove of Evernote tips for students. Jonathan submitted not just one, but eight ways that Evernote helps him become more successful as a student. With so much Evernote joy bursting out of him, it came as no surprise to learn that Jonathan has recently become an Evernote Community Leader so he can continue spreading this joy to others around him. Here are some ways that Evernote helps Jonathan become a more productive and effective student: Tip #1: Save all course-related information into Evernote, then organize into notebooks and notebook stacks Jonathan stores all his handwritten notes, PowerPoint and PDF presentations, and graphic design files in Evernote. He organizes everything from his information science courses into notebooks—first by class, then grouped as notebook stacks, by semester. One of Jonathan’s favorite ways to use Evernote is adding multiple file attachments to a single note, and editing them with the original application, without leaving Evernote . To edit any of these files, he simply double clicks the file link. He considers this feature one of Evernote’s best-kept secrets. Here’s an example of how Jonathan adds various graphics, web (HTML), and stylesheet (.CSS) files to a note: PRO TIP: Use one of Jonathan’s favorite Evernote keyboard shortcuts , Command + J on his Mac, to search, then quickly jump to a recently viewed note or notebook. Tip #2: Use audio recorded lectures to review for exams This semester, Jonathan is taking a course in Programming Design Patterns. For that class, Jonathan relies on Evernote to record the lectures on his phone. When it’s time to study for exams, he re-listens to the lecture as a way to review the key points to keep the concepts fresh in his mind. PRO TIP: Use your phone, rather than your laptop, to record lectures. This prevents the microphone from picking up keyboard-tapping sounds as you type. Tip #3: Scan study notes into Evernote so you can review them later on your phone When it comes time to review for tests, Jonathan prefers to create handwritten study notes, which he then scans into Evernote. This ensures that he has everything backed up and always available on any device. Jonathan doesn’t need to remember how he’s organized his schoolwork anymore and struggled to remember, in fact, the last time he lost anything. “I’ve used Evernote for so long I can’t remember [the last time] I’ve lost something,” he laughs. Last semester, for example, when Jonathan accidentally left his Calculus notebook (with his handwritten formula review notes) at home, Evernote came to the rescue. His panic-stricken gasp quickly turned into a sigh of relief after he realized he’d already scanned his review notes into Evernote. PRO TIP: Evernote Premium customers can get a more focused study experience, by viewing notes as a presentation on a phone or a laptop. Tip #4: Create templates for recurring notes Jonathan designed a template for taking class notes that he reuses each class session. He added structure to his notes using tables. Jonathan’s template includes the following sections: Resources : For useful links to online materials or attached files Key points : For jotting down detailed lecture notes (feel free to resize the columns the way you’d like to) Questions/Actions : For making a list of questions you’d like to research or ask the lecturer about later Summary of notes : For highlights of a lecture, should be lecture, right? presented as an outline, or for attached PDFs of class slides Create templates for recurring notes, such as meeting notes, rough drafts with project milestones, and project task lists. Each time you want to take some new notes, simply create a duplicate of the template note. PRO TIP: No time to create your own class notes template? Use Jonathan’s ! Save it to your Evernote account and reuse it as many times as you’d like. Tip #5: Use shared notebooks as a hub for group projects Jonathan genuinely believes in the ‘sharing is caring’ principle when it comes to sharing information with others. Last semester, he shared all his class notes (along with PDF code file) in a shared notebook with more than 80 of his classmates so they could also study them. Jonathan discovered that shared notebooks are not only useful for sharing notes with others, but a good way for groups to collaborate together on a project. Last year, he shared a notebook with his project group, with ‘Can edit’ permissions. Anyone in the group could save project notes, resource links, and works in progress to this shared notebook. “I’ve used Evernote for so long I can’t remember [the last time] I’ve lost something.”–Jonathan Copeland Here are some examples of notes you can save to a shared project notebook: A rubric describing the project and evaluation criteria A task list, broken down by weeks as a way to track progress Research articles from the web curated using Web Clipper Rough drafts or question responses PRO TIP: If your project group has been assigned a set of questions, divide them up among the group members—one single note per question. Once everyone completes their individual responses, merge all the notes together as a single note before turning it in. Tip #6: Make Evernote a personal knowledge base for both academic and extracurricular notes When he’s not studying, Jonathan has many other hobbies, activities, and responsibilities. He plays bass guitar in a band, volunteers as a video editor and designer for the university newspaper, and keeps himself busy with a bit of freelance app-design work. His Evernote account, as a result, includes an eclectic collection of notes, with guitar chords and audio recordings of all the songs his band plays, saved alongside video gaming notes. Jonathan says that for him, “Evernote is a game changer—having all of my files and work in one easy-to-find location [where] everything’s backed up and easily accessible.” PRO TIP: Keep reminder list notes of books you’d like to read, albums you’d like to buy, or films you’d like to watch. It’s easy to add new items to these lists from your phone, no matter where you are. Follow Jonathan Copeland on Twitter @jmcopel", "date": "2016-08-24,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Evernote’s Future Is in the Cloud", "author": ["Ben McCormack"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/evernotes-future-is-in-the-cloud/", "abstract": "When we marked Evernote’s 8th anniversary this summer, there was a lot to celebrate. We’re proud of what we’ve built: a place where all of your most productive notes and ideas can be collected, nurtured, and preserved. And we’re even more excited about the future, with many new features and enhancements under development. Paving the road for that future means taking a close look at how every part of Evernote operates, including our physical server infrastructure. In reviewing our options, the benefits of adopting a modern cloud solution for our data quickly became clear. After an intensive period of research and investigation involving several cloud providers, we have selected Google Cloud Platform to provide our data infrastructure moving forward. Until now, Evernote has owned, configured, and maintained its own servers and networks. This approach gave us the ability to build the service we wanted the way we wanted to build it. But it is also limiting—expensive to maintain, slow to upgrade, and difficult to scale. And while the infrastructure we have now is perfectly suited to support Evernote as it runs today, it lacks the speed and flexibility we need for tomorrow. Meanwhile, cloud platform services have come into their own, transforming the technological landscape as they become ever more robust. But the question was this: can a cloud service give our 200 million customers the high level of quality, performance, and security they expect and deserve from Evernote? We believe it can. With Google Cloud Platform, Evernote will gain significant improvements in performance, security, efficiency, and scalability. Moving to the cloud also allows us to focus time and resources on the things that matter most. For us, that means building the best home for your notes and giving you the tools to use them more effectively. It’s the right choice. We are currently working with the Google team to finalize our architecture, and will begin syncing data to new servers in early October, a process that will require several weeks. We anticipate a complete migration by the end of 2016. What this means for you The transition to the cloud will occur completely in the background. You should see no impact to your service during the transition, and you do not need to take any action. Behind the scenes, Evernote will become faster, stronger, and more stable. The security and privacy of your data were topmost in mind as we considered moving to the cloud. We are confident that the security controls in Google Cloud Platform match the security we currently have in place while adding encryption at rest, a feature many users have asked for in the past. Evernote remains committed to the same Three Laws of Data Protection that have always guided us: Your Data is Yours Your Data is Protected Your Data is Portable Your notes are not owned by Evernote, or by Google. They are yours and yours alone. Questions? See our FAQ » What this means for Evernote While your experience will be largely unchanged, behind the scenes there will be tremendous benefits that will help us improve your use of Evernote in the near future. Critical infrastructure upgrades that currently take days will be completed in seconds. Resources will be freed to accelerate current development and improve our core products. We’ll even be able to roll out feature updates to our customers in less time. In addition to scale, speed, and stability, Google will also give Evernote access to some of the same deep-learning technologies that power services like translation, photo management, and voice search. We look forward to taking advantage of these technologies to help you more easily connect your ideas, search for information in Evernote, and find the right note at the moment you need it. That’s exciting to us, and we’re already exploring some ideas that we think you’ll love. We feel that Google Cloud Platform is a great fit for Evernote’s needs, now and into the future. Some of the world’s most innovative brands, including Spotify, Snapchat, Coca-Cola and Philips already rely on Google Cloud Platform. We are thrilled to take this step to build a faster, more powerful, and better home for your most important notes and ideas. If you have questions about this change, please see our FAQ .

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Manage Your Job Search in Evernote", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/manage-your-job-search-in-evernote/", "abstract": "Job hunting can be an overwhelming experience. Whether you’re about to embark on your career, searching for new challenges, or exploring your options, Evernote helps you take control of your job search. Collect job advertisements, organize your applications, and keep résumés/CVs, work samples, letters of recommendation, and contact details in Evernote. Create a career portfolio Preparation is often the key to success. Taking the time to prepare in advance will make your job search quicker, easier, and much more painless. 1. Create a notebook dedicated to your career The first step is to set up a workspace in which you keep your job-related material. You can title your notebook however you like. It might be empty at first, but don’t panic. After you’ve created your notebook, think of the various ingredients that go into any job application. What pieces of information do you need on hand when applying for a position? Curriculum vitæ or résumé Cover letter or letter of motivation Samples of previous work Photo (if including a photo in your application is common practice with where you live) Chances are, your information will come in a variety of formats: Word docs, PDFs, images, or even multimedia files. But no matter the format, you can keep them all in the same note—which brings us to the next step. 2. Create a note dedicated to your work history In your “Professional” notebook, create a new note and give it a name. This will be your career portfolio note , where you will keep your CV, résumé, cover letters, and sample work. Tip: Add “@” before the title of your note to pin it to the top of the note view for easier access as you fill up your notebook with more information. Your career portfolio note is where you keep all of your application pieces in one place. If you already have previous versions of your CV, résumé, cover letters, sample work, photos, sound files, and videos, add them as attachments or links into this note. 3. Maintain your career portfolio note Keep your CV or résumé updated, even if you’re happily employed. It’s a good idea to sit down at least once a year to update your CV. Keep older versions of your CVs; it’s nice to revisit them and see your professional development. If you’re not tied to a specific career path, having variations of your cover letters is also a very good idea. Since every position you apply for is different, it makes sense to keep several versions as templates. You might still need to tweak each letter to the job you’re applying for, but having templates will help cut down time tremendously. Below the CVs and cover letters, create a section in your note dedicated to your sample work. In it, keep everything you show a potential employer. Whenever you complete a project you’re particularly proud of, drop it into your portfolio along with the date of completion. Once you’ve set up the essentials in a career portfolio note, add any additional sections you still need like your headshot or digital signature. An updated career portfolio note ready in Evernote saves you the trouble of revamping your CV, creating new cover letters, and hunting for your previous work information. When you look for a job, you often have to work quickly, so having your job search materials organized and ready will allow you to start the process immediately. Tip: In addition to your portfolio and résumé, Evernote is a great place to develop and refine your elevator pitch . Preparing a set of talking points can help you keep your interviews grounded. Collect with Web Clipper If you don’t have a recruiter to help you scout for jobs, you probably rely on several job search engines or aggregators like LinkedIn. Use the Evernote Web Clipper to clip jobs that interest you. You can also clip articles or advice from career sites that you like. Web Clipper makes it easy to clip a job ad from any website. Once you’ve downloaded the browser extension, simply click on the Web Clipper (elephant) button to save the page (or parts of the page) to Evernote. You can adjust the size of your clipping to include more or less information by clicking on the “+” or “-“ buttons. Tip: For a clean-looking web clip, try the “Simplified article” option. Evernote strips extraneous banners and formatting from the webpage, so you’re left with a distraction-free article. Once you’ve set the size of your clipping, give it a name. The web page will be saved in Evernote as a new note under this name. You may prefer to use a naming system that includes information such as when the job was posted, the name of the company, and the job title. [Job post date YYYY MM DD] [COMPANY NAME] [Job position] When you name a note starting with the date and then organize your notes in Evernote by name, your notes will be displayed chronologically and you can easily prioritize which jobs to apply for first. Finally, before clicking the “Save” button, select the “Professional” notebook you created earlier. You have the option of adding tags or a remark to your clip before saving. Apply and track your progress In addition to online job adverts, you might have job leads coming in from other sources such as referrals and recruiter calls. Be sure to create separate notes for these opportunities too, including contact information and a short description of the role. Once you have all your leads in one place, it’s time to focus on applying for a job. If you have set up your career portfolio by following the steps above, you would have saved yourself a lot of time. Now all you need to do is tweak your cover letter—everything else should already be in your career portfolio note. After you’ve sent in an application, save a copy of all the documents you used in your application in Evernote. This way, when you get a response from a potential employer, you’ll know exactly what you’ve sent and avoid the potential embarrassment of mixing up your applications. Be sure to update your notes with each new development. Include details such as contact information, the status of your application, company research notes, and questions to ask in an interview. You can also set reminders for upcoming interview appointments. Tip: If you’ve received positive feedback on a specific piece of your application, keep note of it. You can move a particularly successful cover letter to your career portfolio note. Keep any notes for job applications for which you’ve received interview opportunities. Also, if you get hit with an unexpected question in an interview, note it down too so that you’re better prepared for next time. Not only will Evernote help you in the job hunting process, you’ll have a collection of documents, notes, and sample work you can reference whenever you want.", "date": "2016-09-23,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "5 Ways to Use Evernote You May Not Have Thought About", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/5-other-ways-to-use-evernote/", "abstract": "You’ve heard that Evernote is a great college companion for note-taking, studying, and organizing your class and extracurricular life. You know that you probably should find some way to be better organized, but how, exactly, can Evernote help? You might know a thing or two about how to use Evernote, but with these tips, you can become a power user today. 1. Start using Evernote before you ever get to class There is a growing movement in some colleges in which professors are banning the use of electronics in class . That means no laptops, no phones, and no tablets. They say (and we admit, there is merit to the argument) that the temptation to quickly switch to Facebook, or check email, or even shop online is too great for even the professors to resist. Fortunately, a lack of in-class technology won’t stop Evernote. You can still take your notes the old-fashioned way, and then move and organize them in Evernote for later study. Write your notes on paper, and then, after class, use your phone to take pictures of each page. Evernote automatically turns each photo into a document, and its character-reading capabilities let you search your note content later. Put those notes into the notebooks for each class. 2. Record lectures If your professor allows it, use Evernote’s audio recording abilities to capture lectures while you jot down your notes. Here, Evernote Premium does double duty as both a note-taking app and a sound recorder. When you review for your exam, listen to the lecture again along with your written notes as a guide. The audio and typed files stay together in Evernote, so you won’t spend extra time searching for loose documents. Pro tip: Attach reminders to audio, images, or notes. Evernote will remind you when it’s time to study. 3. Import, draw and write on PDFs Sometimes, you’ll get PDFs through your student portal or email, and it’s up to you to make sure they’re filed away with your class materials. Evernote won’t let you lose those, either, and better still, you can mark them up electronically, without switching apps. Email yourself the PDF. (With Evernote Premium, you get a personalized email address within Evernote that allows you to send files to Evernote via email. You can even specify which notebook to save it in.) Open the PDF in Evernote, and you can highlight, annotate, underline, or add stickers to remind you of the most important points. And PDF documents are searchable by keyword, too. Pro tip : Use your phone’s camera to scan paper documents you get in class. On your computer, drag and drop PDFs and Microsoft Office documents into Evernote to keep them alongside related class notes. 4. Remind yourself to help meet deadlines and avoid last-minute panics In the Broadway musical “Avenue Q,” the puppet characters fondly remember college as they sing “ Sitting in the computer lab, 4 a.m. before the final paper is due, cursing the world ’cause I didn’t start sooner, and seeing the rest of the class there, too!” This trope doesn’t have to happen to you. Yes, it’s easy to underestimate how much time projects will take. With Evernote’s gentle email and text reminders and to-do checkbox lists, you can minimize your all-nighters and midterm and finals stress. Pro tip: As collaborative work environments become more prevalent in the business world, universities and colleges are teaching students to work in groups. If you’re part of a work group, use Evernote to share checklists and notes with each other so that everyone can see the group’s progress, get reminders, and become accountable to each other. 5. Bring Evernote with you for extracurricular activities, a.k.a. your life. As valuable as Evernote is as a study partner, helper, and reminder, it’s just as helpful by your side outside of the classroom. Keep work schedules, photos, event flyers, and memories you want to keep in separate notebooks. Scan and keep receipts, grade sheets, directions, bills, even entire web pages in Evernote, too. Set reminders for your personal goals and things to do, like fitness tracking and calling your parents.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Use Evernote to Create “Wow” Moments in Your Relationships", "author": ["Patrick Ewers"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/create-wow-moments-in-your-relationships/", "abstract": "For many of us—from executives to small business owners or salespeople—success is built on creating and maintaining strong personal relationships. The more we remember about others, the easier it is to forge a deep connection. Think about people you meet for the second time. Aren’t you impressed when they remember details about you? Knowing something about the other person make it easier to start a conversation, makes everyone more comfortable, and builds trust. But it’s hard to remember everything about all the people we meet. While the information is clear right after the meeting, over time, we tend to forget, and that can lead to lost opportunities. The information decay problem Say you’re meeting a new client—let’s call him Phillip—and you learn some interesting facts during the conversation: Phillip has two daughters: Mary, age 3, and Catherine, age 5. He says Catherine looks more like him, while Mary looks more like her mother. He mentions in passing that Mary has been suffering from asthma, which has been generating stress and anxiety in his family. Finally, the family just celebrated Mary’s birthday on March 22. You’ll quickly discover facts like these whenever you meet with people. You can can also perceive a lot through their tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language. Even if this information is not business-related, it’s powerful knowledge that can help you connect with your clients on a personal level, creating trust and rapport that will pay dividends later on. However, if you don’t have a system for remembering it, you’ll eventually forget what you’ve learned. Let’s go back to our example. On the day of the meeting, you’ll probably remember everything you’ve learned about Phillip and his family. After a day, you may forget Mary’s birthday. A week later, you’ll have likely forgotten the names of your client’s children, but you may remember that one of them suffers from asthma. It will also probably have slipped your mind which child looks like which parent. A month later, you may only remember that he has kids. In another six months, you may not remember much about Phillip at all. When you meet again, you’ll be starting over from scratch. Fortunately, there’s a simple methodology to help you remember those details. Creating a “meeting debrief” is an easy way to capture and remember details about your contacts. With a debrief handy, you can reconnect faster and produce that “wow” feeling when you meet them again. Debrief your meetings in Evernote Evernote is the tool I recommend to my clients for collecting meeting debriefs and storing them in a structured and easily accessible way. To get started, just create a new note (you may even want to start a meeting debrief notebook, where you can keep records of everyone you meet in one place), and then jot down the information you’ve learned in it. A meeting debrief might look like this: Get this Meeting Debrief template for Evernote. To use this template, click the “Preview” link and then click “Save to Evernote” to add the template to your Evernote account. You can copy, rename, and edit the note in your account. Using the Debrief Before you meet again, to pull up your debrief note and quickly refresh your memory. You can find it quickly by typing any word you know is in the note.  Not only will your client be impressed that you cared enough to bring these details into the conversation, but you’ll also break the ice faster and find common ground. Affinity builds rapport, so you can build deeper relationships, win repeat business, and turn a client into a referral.

You know what to expect, and the mistakes you made as a Freshman are, hopefully, behind you. You know what’s up. That’s what Vinson Luo thought as he started his sophomore year as a computer science major. Another year of scribbling in notebooks, trying to copy diagrams properly and hoping beyond hope that he didn’t spill anything on his notes. Or worse, drop them in the snow. After all, Vinson is a native of Taiwan who grew up in California, and he just didn’t do snow. One of the things that Vinson, a sophomore at Indiana’s Purdue University, learned during freshman year was that taking notes by hand wasn’t always effective. So this year, he tried something new: note-taking in Evernote. “Back in Introductory Object Oriented Programming and Programming in C and C++, the lectures contained a lot of code snippets,” Vinson explains. “Those snippets aren’t the easiest or cleanest things to try to write down. Last year when I took the course, it was just messy, taking handwritten notes. They’re easy to lose, and they can get damaged easily. As a CS major, a lot of diagrams come into play, and we need a way to get crisp and clean images for notes and homework.” Since turning to Evernote Premium in August, Vinson has a much easier time keeping up. He created notebooks for each of his classes and keeps notes for each class within a notebook. That way, when he’s studying later, he needs only to search for keywords within the class notebook and avoids having to wade through unwanted or confusing results. That came in handy: freshman year was just a glimpse into how complex his more advanced classes were to become. PRO TIP: Use Command+J to quickly switch between notes, or use Evernote’s advanced search syntax Firing up both laptop and computer to capture everything “Now in Computer Architecture, in addition to code, there is also hardware, like circuit diagrams,” Vinson reports. “That class is pretty graphics heavy compared to the other CS courses that I have taken. That’s where the whiteboard/image capture comes in handy. There is absolutely no other way to keep track of all that, drawing them AND following along with the lecture. With Evernote, I can open up my laptop and have my phone’s camera ready. I can type and import images into notes relatively quickly.” Getting to the point where using Evernote was a natural part of Vinson’s day took a little time. When he was first introduced to Evernote this summer, his initial thought was that the product was interesting and could be useful to people in college, but only if students used it regularly. “Before, I didn’t carry my laptop with me to class,” Vinson says. “Just because it’s dumb and heavy and I was used to pen and paper. But on the first day of the semester, I brought in the laptop and just gave it a whirl. It surprised me how quick, efficient and organized I can keep my notes. Over time, I started to bring my laptop to all my lectures every day,” he remembers. “I didn’t even really notice that Evernote was gradually becoming a habit.” How to Know What You Don’t Know Outside of class, Vinson discovered Evernote helps him to not only find his notes but to discover gaps in his knowledge. “I’m okay with coding at this point, but when hardware logic comes into play, that’s a little more frightening,” Vinson relates. “I didn’t know what I knew, and I didn’t know what information I was missing. I use keywords from study guides and plug them into Evernote if I can’t find them in my notes. If those keywords aren’t there, it means I’m missing something.” When a keyword fails to appear in Vinson’s notes, he goes back to the textbook and class materials to fill in the blanks. “I can’t really go on through my college days without Evernote now,” Vinson says. “I’m even going to use it for digital illustration.” For years, he’s been developing artwork for characters and stories, filling up sketch pads and notebooks with ideas. “Evernote will be helpful for gathering reference materials for both my artworks’ visual and background stories,” he says. Vinson proves that you can still improve your note-taking—and, by extension, your college experience, by finding a better way to do it. And, as Vinson discovered, when something works that well, it’s easy for it to become a habit without too much effort.", "date": "2016-10-28,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "I Wrote a Novel Entirely in Evernote. Here’s How.", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/i-wrote-a-novel-entirely-in-evernote/", "abstract": "Over the past few months, we’ve highlighted some of the unique ways Evernote employees use the software they build and support—from capturing sketches to digital scrapbooking . In honor of National Novel Writing Month (a.k.a. NaNoWriMo), the head of our marketing content team shares his method for crafting a novel entirely in Evernote. Like many writers, I used to view Evernote as just one component of a larger writing system. I kept my brainstorming and research notes in Evernote, while composing drafts in another app. But the writing apps seemed to change on a whim, sometimes even mid-project. Word, Scrivener, Google Docs, Ulysses… I’ve used them all. Each has its strengths, but I couldn’t find a system that suited me . As I grew more comfortable with Evernote over the years, I noticed I was using it to record an ever-expanding range of personal thoughts and work projects. Eventually, I decided to stop riding the app merry-go-round and write a 10,000-word novelette entirely in Evernote, without switching to another platform. It was a bit of a risk, especially since I was on deadline for an anthology, but the experiment went better than I ever imagined. When I no longer had to mentally switch gears to manage two different interfaces and sets of commands, my writing output accelerated. Instead of fiddling with settings and styles for hours on end (one of my worst productivity traps), I could just write. With Evernote Premium on my home laptop, work laptop, and phone, I could slip in a sentence or two wherever I was, at any time, in the app I was already using . And I never lost track of an idea, because the entire story project was always right at my fingertips. The author at NaNoWriMo’s 2014 Night of Writing Dangerously. Bow tie color coordination was purely coincidental. After trying this system out on a couple of novelettes, I had it refined enough to think bigger. I dove into 2015’s National Novel Writing Month with Evernote open and all those other apps tucked away out of sight. I’m doing it again this year. Here’s how it works. The set-up: from notebooks to tags Even if you’ve already started writing your story, a little time spent organizing now will pay dividends down the road. There are three main components to this setup: Step 1. Notes and notebooks For a novel-length project, set up a notebook exclusively for that novel. Each chapter goes into a separate note. Along with the actual chapters of the draft, I like to include a few additional notes: Snippets: This note is where I record all the random bits of dialogue and description that pop into my head during the day, even if I don’t know how I’ll eventually use them. ( Psst: If you’re doing NaNoWriMo, include snippets as part of your word count! ) Unresolved questions: I start each day by reading the previous day’s writing and note any loose threads I find. This step helps me write a tighter ending and saves a lot of time once I’m ready to edit the story. Deleted scenes: Sometimes I can’t stop myself from editing while drafting. If I feel compelled to cut a scene, I like to keep it handy, just in case. Of course, you’ll also have dozens of notes for research (I recommend one note per topic), character sheets, settings, and story planning. Step 2. Titles and sorting The next step is to make sure all those notes follow the same titling method, so you’ll always know which note is which. For chapters, I like the format “[NOVEL] Chapter 01: Chapter Title.” For characters, I’ll use a title like “[NOVEL] Character: Angelica de Rothburg.” For research, I use “[NOVEL] Research: Useful Arabic Phrases,” and so on. Choose a format that works for you and apply it consistently. Note: although I’m using “NOVEL” in these examples, that’s just a placeholder. In practice, I use a three-letter code for each project. That helps me keep everything straight and avoid mixing up projects. For my novel-in-progress “Five Fingers of Fate,” for example, each note title begins with [FFF]. Next, sort your note lists alphabetically by title. This is especially useful in the Chapter list, which is best kept in the correct order. If you want your most recently edited notes at the top instead, you can always change it back. Step 3. Tags and shortcuts This step is where the magic happens. Without tags, all those notes will be much harder to navigate. The object is to get to the right note as quickly as possible, without searching, to keep the words flowing. For a novel, I’ll create a set of specialized tags for each kind of note I’m creating: novel novel-chapters novel-characters novel-locations novel-plotting novel-research Note: Again, although I’m using “novel” in these examples, it’s important to create unique tags for each project , or else you’ll wind up with notes for multiple stories all mixed together. In practice, I use the same three-letter code for tags that I selected for the note titles. When I add new notes to the project, I’m diligent about attaching both the generic tag for the novel and the specific tag saying what kind of note it is. Once you’ve tagged everything, you can search for the “novel-chapters” tag to instantly bring up all the chapters in the note list, and nothing else. Even better, create a shortcut for each tag and you won’t even have to search. Just click the tag in the shortcut list, and voila, the right notes appear. Secret Tip #1: If you really want to get fancy, add emojis to tags so you can find them faster. Secret Tip #2: Create additional tags for each main character, so you can filter for just the chapters in which they appear. This makes it easier to keep track of them as your novel grows. A dashboard for your novel When I’m working on a really large writing project like a novel, note lists aren’t enough for me. I want one central place where I can manage the entire project from start to finish. Enter the “dashboard” note. This note gets a title like “[NOVEL] .DASHBOARD,” and I give it all the main tags I’ve created for my project. Using all the tags means this note appears in every one of my filtered views, and the period in front of “DASHBOARD” ensures it always appears at the top of the note list if I’m sorting alphabetically. What goes into a dashboard note? Pretty much everything. Basic Info: At the top of the note is a simple table where I list the novel’s title, genre, target word count, and series. I’ll also insert a one-paragraph premise summarizing what the novel is about (with a link to the worksheet I used to write the premise). For NaNoWriMo, I’ll also include links to the NaNoWriMo website and forum, plus a Google spreadsheet where I track my word count progress throughout the month. Status checklist: This is where I check off tasks as I start and complete them. Tasks may include things like coming up with a story premise, outlining the plot, and actually writing the draft. When it’s time to edit, I’ll add those tasks here too. Plot summary: Longer than the premise, this is four or five paragraphs describing the entire story from beginning to end. When I get lost midway through the draft (and I will), I can always look back at this summary and remind myself of where I’m going and why. Chapter breakdown: This table contains one-line summaries of what happens (or what I think will happen) in each chapter. If I’m feeling particularly organized, I might fill this out in advance, but usually, it gets filled out as I go along. Each row has a checkbox so I know at a glance how much of the story I’ve already finished. I also include links to each chapter note so I can always jump directly to a particular chapter when I need to. Want your own novel dashboard note? Download the template » And that’s it! This system may not work for everyone. It’s evolved over time to fit my individual quirks and habits. But it’s been tremendously helpful in organizing my messy mind and keeping my eyes on the prize, in NaNoWriMo or any other big writing project. I hope it will help you, too.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How Evernoters Use Evernote: From Brazil to Silicon Valley", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-evernoters-use-evernote/", "abstract": "The road to Silicon Valley success, is, like Hollywood, often decidedly un-glamorous. Silicon Valley companies have so many ardent fans that a tech tourism industry has built up around companies that people love. And, like in Hollywood throughout the ages, talented young people flock to the valley in hope that one of these companies will discover them and give them a job. Julia Figueiredo was one of them. A student at the University of California at Berkeley, doing a post-graduate finance program, Julia relied on Evernote as essential to her studies. Evernote had been at Julia’s side from her move from Belo Horizonte, Brazil, through her year at UC Berkeley. It was with her during her first tentative steps at a technology incubator. Finally, it put her on the path to the elusive Silicon Valley dream job—at Evernote. Alongside the glittering monolithic headquarters of companies like Google, Intel, and Facebook, nondescript rental offices house start-ups with just a few employees. Tech incubators, which are organizations that help other fledgling companies become start-ups, share office space with dental offices and insurance agencies. It is there that the next wave of top tech talent can be found. It was in a respected tech incubator far away from the admiring gazes of the tourists that Julia evangelized Evernote. She taught her fellow employees how useful it is for business teams, she showed off some of the features she’d been using for years. Her dedication to Evernote led one of her clients to tell her about a job listing she’d seen: Evernote was looking for a person to help with their Brazilian marketing efforts. “I think you’d be perfect for it,” the client advised. “After all, I started using Evernote because of you!” Julia was Brazilian. She had tech experience. She was an Evernote power user. But for Julia, that wasn’t enough for her to seal the deal. She did what Evernote power users do naturally: she organized. Step 1: Do Company research “I created a notebook called “Evernote Job” so I could gather all of the information I would need during the interview process,” Julia recalls. “The first thing I added to the notebook was the job description.” PRO TIP : Did you know that Evernote can automatically file a note into the right notebook for you? Check out Evernote Smart Filing. After that, Julia honed in on the company. She researched everything she could find about the corporate side of Evernote. Then, she used Evernote Web Clipper to put these articles into her notebook for later reference. “I looked at the website, but I didn’t stop there,” she says. “They have YouTube channels , blogs in both English and Portuguese (and other languages) Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Glassdoor profiles. I watched countless videos of the CEO,” she laughed. Step 2: Learn the Product Inside and Out Julia used Evernote every day, but one of the things she liked about it was how naturally it fit into her life. But did she know all of its features? Did she know why she liked some parts of Evernote better than others? Did she have ideas about how to improve it from a customer perspective? Could she relate stories about how she used it effectively? “It’s not enough to say you’re a power user,” Julia says, “you have to be able to prove it.” She reviewed everything she knew, and created a note for herself to refer to should she need it. Step 3: Reach out to people With talented people pouring into Silicon Valley every week, Julia knew that competition would be fierce, even with a job she knew she was perfect for. Being “right” for a job in Silicon Valley is a commodity. It’s differentiators that win jobs. In Julia’s case, she did a thorough surveillance on Linkedin of everyone on the hiring team, so she would know something about each of them when she met them face-to-face. She also reached out to people inside the company—including the person she would be replacing—to gather as much information as she could. She learned about public events in which Evernote would either be hosting or participating, and she showed up. “For example,” she says, “the General Manager for Evernote in Latin America was speaking at a panel, and I went to hear him speak.” She also met other team members there, and through other events. Step 4: Rehearse the interview “Even before I had a face-to-face interview, I used Evernote to create a note with more than 30 possible questions they might ask me. I wrote down all the answers, so they would come naturally during the interview.” Julia’s tenure at the tech incubator was not long. With her solid preparation, honest passion for the product, and clear intention to land the job, Julia made that differentiating impression Evernote managers, and for more than a year later, she was the voice of Evernote in Brazil. Now, she is Evernote’s global partner marketing manager. Next week, Julia will return to Brazil for CASE 2016, the largest conference for entrepreneurs and startups in Latin America representing Evernote’s success in the region. She’ll also serve as the interpreter to CEO Chris O’Neill as he delivers the keynote address on the world stage. With such a large responsibility, how does she plan to organize it all? “In Evernote, of course,” she says. Want to work at Evernote?

NaNoWriMo), or using Evernote to organize your thoughts as many writers do, you may be thinking about the journey from blank page to finished work. It’s a conundrum every writer must face: how do you get from here — the resolution to write — to there , a completed text you can be proud of (or maybe even publish)? “In your mind, your novel is an epic tale that will redefine a genre,” says Andy Weir, author of The Martian . “You have the setting defined in excruciating detail. You could fill an encyclopedia with information about the protagonist’s childhood. You have the next six books in the series all planned out. Why can’t you squeeze out a single sentence?” Una LaMarche, a writer of young adult novels, adds: “It’s like Michelangelo chipping away at a block of marble, only instead of marble you have a computer screen and instead of a chisel you have a stress headache.” Ouch. Being a writer means coming up against sometimes harsh realities. But those obstacles can be overcome with the simple techniques. Evernote, along with our friends at Penguin Random House, is pleased to present a free ebook, Signature’s Ultimate Guide to Writing Advice . The ebook was produced in conjunction with Penguin Random House’s Signature website, a premier destination for writers and readers of all kinds. Get the Ultimate Guide to Writing Advice » In the Ultimate Guide , twelve writers at the top of their games (plus one leading editor) open up about every phase of the writing process. It’s all here: planning a story, coming up with an opening, overcoming writer’s block, and getting into the write — er, right — mindset to sit down at the keyboard every day: Elizabeth Berg — “What it Takes to Be a Writer” Una LaMarche — “4 Tricks on Self-Starting” L.Y. Marlow — “Write a Sh*tty First Draft” Charles Baxter — “Opening a Story the Right Way” David Levithan — “[Insert Strong Title Here]” Emma Campion — “Turning Fear into Excitement” Taylor Stevens — “Inspiration Is for Amateurs” Andy Weir — “The Tyranny of the Blank Page” Maggie Shipstead — “On Little Moments of Unlocking” John Marshall — “How Writing Is Like Traveling” Jo Baker — “The Natural State of ‘Outsiderliness’” Alexis Landau — “7 Habits of Highly Effective Writers” Benjamin Dreyer — “A to X Writing Advice” One thing all the contributors agree on: An aspiring writer must never give up. “Sometimes the words you put down aren’t even coherent,” says thriller writer Taylor Stevens. “Sometimes the thoughts are jumbled. And certainly none of them read very well. But none of that matters. What matters is that you sit there and write, and you write, and you keep writing.” As any user of Evernote knows first-hand, capturing ideas while they’re fresh can pay off down the road. As Maggie Shipstead, author of Astonish Me , says: “That moment right before sleep has been fruitful for me… I’ve learned, though, that I have to rouse myself enough to make a note on my phone or on paper, otherwise my breakthroughs tend to have vanished by morning.” Alexis Landau, the author of Empire of the Senses , agrees: “I try to remember not to dismiss any idea, no matter how arbitrary it may seem in the moment, because sometimes the small detail or phrase later generates a great scene or moment in the story which was unexpected.” And in the end, that’s what writing is all about, regardless of your chosen genre. It’s an adventure and a process of discovery. Or in the words of award-winning screenwriter John Marshall: “A journey of a thousand miles, like a book of a thousand pages, begins with a single step. A single word. So I write it. And write another one. And cross that one off.

But Brian, the technical program manager at Evernote, isn’t thinking about the holidays. He’s thinking about a teddy bear. Brian just made a recreation of his childhood teddy bear as a present for his mother. Not that he knew how to sew, or had a pattern, or any idea how he was going to do it. He gave it to her the previous weekend, at his sister’s wedding. And it was perfect. “Counter-programming” for the holidays “You want to know what the holidays are about?” Brian asked. “It’s all about family time, and being together. Anybody could tell you how to use Evernote to make shopping lists and gift check-offs. I use Evernote at the holidays to plan ahead, to make sure I have plenty of time for people I love. I call it counter-programming. I find ways to avoid crowds, I work ahead to make time for family, and use the time off to plan for projects I’ll want to do during the rest of the year. The goal is eking out every moment you can for relaxation. To optimize those precious moments you have with your family.” We’ll get back to the teddy bear in a moment. Brian makes it clear: if you want that peaceful, memorable holiday time, you need to plan ahead. Naturally, Brian uses Evernote. At work, he uses a template to keep track of his team’s quarterly and annual achievements, so he doesn’t have to scramble to finish year-end reports. “When you’re stressed out, that’s when you’ll fail,” Brian said. His template includes simple red/yellow/green buttons to indicate the status of each project. He simply puts finishing touches on the note and submits it for his end of the year report. Get Brian’s Evernote template to track quarterly or annual progress Lists to minimize stress at home At home, Brian’s taking no chances of letting anything ruin his holidays, either. He keeps lists of contractors who would be available in any emergency. “In areas where it rains and snows, and there’s a leak somewhere, or a storm drain backs up, you want to be ready.” His contractors’ list includes quotes, notes about quality, and reviews that he’s collected during the year, while he researched other, non-emergency home projects. Though Brian is a home renovation enthusiast, he says that the holidays are absolutely not the time to take on big projects. The holidays, he says, are the time to plan. He scans through magazines and uses the Evernote camera to take pictures of inspirations for remodels he plans for later in the year. That way, he can categorize the images into notebooks and tag each photo by project or idea. His tags include items like “roof” and “home addition” so he doesn’t have to remember why he took a certain picture. He also uses the cold winter nights to scan websites like Houzz , real estate sites, developers’ online portfolios and interior designers’ websites for ideas, and he uses Web Clipper to save those images into his notebooks as well. His images range from roof tiles, paint swatches, his idea sketches, landscaping layouts, and pictures of individual plants in his garden to Christmas decorations and photographs of the underside of his kitchen sink, annotated with dimensions. He is an avid photographer and chronicler of the ordinary, using his phone to randomly snap pictures of walls, furniture, rugs, and lighting fixtures, but these images come to life in Evernote. Brian’s annotated photo for future renovation, created and stored in Evernote “You know what’s really interesting? Watching how your home changes over the years. These are things you miss if you aren’t paying attention. Being able to re-watch your garden growing and receding. Being able to notice and reflect on things like that. I annotate my garden pictures,” he said. “I know which plants worked and which ones didn’t.” He points out a close-up of tiny green leaves poking through the soil. They’re his great-grandmother’s irises. “She planted them decades ago in Fargo, North Dakota,” he recalled. “We’ve been passing the bulbs down through the generations ever since. My mom sent me some of those bulbs, and now they’re growing here in California.” He tapped on the photo for emphasis. “This stuff is too precious to risk losing,” he said. “Read the instructions. Ask questions. Figure it out. It’s not hard.” That brings us back to the teddy bear. Part of Brian’s plan to maximize time with family includes spending as little time in malls as possible. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t shop, and he values the time put into making gifts himself. Brian’s inextinguishable desire to do things himself led him to do something he’d never attempted before. He had a photo in Evernote of his childhood teddy bear, a fabric-and-button home-crafted bear with a blue ribbon bow tie. He loved that bear. He still has it. The new bear, however, would have a pink bow tie, to honor the impending arrival of a baby daughter. The fact that Brian had never sewn anything before left him unfazed. “I just like to make stuff,” Brian explained. “The more I do, the more I realize we can do anything if we’re not afraid to fail the first time. Look on YouTube. Read the instructions. Ask questions. Figure it out. It’s not hard.” Brian bought a sewing machine online, then went to a local fabric and craft store for help. “There’s a time and place for online shopping,” Brian said. “If you know what you want and what you’re willing to pay, online is great. But if you have questions, it’s important to spend the money locally and talk to someone who knows what they’re doing. I spend money at those stores so I can make sure they’ll still be there for the next person who has questions.” Brian left with the perfect fabric, some inexpensive fabric to practice, and a lot of advice from sewing experts. He created his pattern from the photograph in Evernote, set up the sewing machine using the step-by-step guide that came in the box, and went to work. “The more I do, the more I realize we can do anything if we’re not afraid to fail the first time.” At home for the wedding, Brian presented his mother with the teddy bear. “She was teary as heck,” Brian smiled. “Exactly the response I was going for.” Brian’s mom with the finished teddy bear Now home and in full holiday mode, Brian is turning his attention back to his home. Now that the leaves have fallen, it’s time to trim back the trees. He’s already annotated photos of the trees he wants to be cut, put his mother’s holiday jello recipe in Evernote, and he’s searching for out-of-the- way places to take his family and clipping those ideas into Evernote, too. And he’s contemplating making another bear. Take Evernote home for the holidays.

With this much buzz and excitement in the air at Evernote’s Redwood City headquarters, you’d think we were having a book signing event with a celebrity author and giveaways. But that’s not why they came. Evernote fans came to hear the leadership team talk about what we’re working on, and what we plan to do next. We invited Plus, Premium, and Evernote Business subscribers from the greater San Francisco Bay Area to get an insider’s view into the company, our projects, and our team. Evernote—the app, the company, and the community Throughout the evening, we heard some inspiring Evernote stories from our guests: We met Rajesh, who works in ecommerce and views Evernote not only as tool for getting things done, but as a way to incubate and clarify his thoughts and ideas. “As a knowledge worker,” he explained, “if my thought processes aren’t clear, my team’s productivity would be lagging somewhere…If I am not personally organized, my team will suffer.” We met folks who started using Evernote as students, but now, in the workforce, rely on it to gather research, to organize, and to easily retrieve design ideas. Still others use Evernote to manage teams. One owner of a Bay Area skateboard business creates a single note with checklists for each employee on his team. He uses this approach to stay on top of what each person is doing. For one guest named Joseph, Evernote is a precious digital archive he can pass along to future generations. Before his father passed away, he saved all the family’s genealogical research he had collected to Evernote. Evernote leaders come out to meet the community The evening continued with Evernote’s CEO Chris O’Neill welcoming the guests and conducting a quick, ‘show-of-hands’ survey to find out who in the crowd had used Evernote the longest. The audience gave thunderous applause to those in the room who’d been faithful Evernote fans since its inception. “I came to Evernote for a few reasons, one of which was the community.” – Chris O’Neill “Evernote is a superpower that makes me better, more organized, and more successful in whatever it is I’m doing,” Chris began. “I was one of you,” he continued, “and came to Evernote for a few reasons, one of which was the community.” In a brief ‘State of Evernote’ address, Chris emphasized how Evernote, as a company, “is strong and continues to be strong.” He credited this strength, in part, to the shoulders of giants, such as Stepan Pachikov , Evernote’s co-founder, who envisioned Evernote as an extension of his brain. “Design is really just a series of conversation with the people you’re trying to serve—bringing in folks like you early in the process so we can learn.” – Nate Fortin Erik Wrobel, Chief Product Officer, and Nate Fortin, Vice President of Design, were up next. Erik gave our guests (who all signed a non-disclosure agreements beforehand) a sneak preview of our product roadmap. Nate talked about product development, emphasizing the importance of customer feedback, stating that “design is really just a series of conversations with the people you’re trying to serve—bringing in folks like you early in the process so we can learn.” The evening concluded with a panel of Evernote’s senior leaders who came to hear customer feedback about issues of privacy, security, and machine learning. Emily Hancock, Vice President of Legal, Rich Tener, Director of Security, and Anirban Kundu, Chief Technology Officer, were invited to join Chris upfront to field questions from the audience. “This event reminded me what I appreciate about Evernote.” – Stacy Garfinkel, Consultant with Stacy Communications When the program officially ended, guests didn’t want to leave. A large group of people stayed behind to meet the leadership team, and to continue conversations with others they connected with at the start of the event. Still others stayed behind to share stories with us of how Evernote has positively impacted their lives. Stacy Garfinkel, a communications consultant, had this to say about the evening, “This event reminded me what I appreciate about Evernote.” For more information about future Evernote Community events, please visit our Community page »", "date": "2017-02-16,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "IFTTT: (If) You’d Like to Automate Evernote, (Then) You Should Try These", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/ifttt-automate-evernote-with-these-applets/", "abstract": "In a busy world, more apps and services often mean more clutter. Ideas get scattered across notes, files, social media posts, and emails. Contacts are in one app, photos in another. Moving information is a pain, if we remember to do it at all. That’s where IFTTT comes in. IFTTT (“If This, Then That,” pronounced “IF-tee”) makes it easy to connect your favorite apps by creating simple recipes known as “applets”: If something happens in one app, IFTTT automatically triggers an action in another app. For example, if you add a new contact to your phone, IFTTT can create a note for that contact in Evernote. You can create a new applet yourself in under a minute (no coding required), or use any of the thousands of applets shared by other IFTTT users. Here are a few of our favorite applets that connect to Evernote. Gmail: More than half of Evernote customers have Gmail accounts, and IFTTT makes it ridiculously easy to archive important pieces of information from Gmail . You can tell IFTTT to save all your Amazon order confirmations and iTunes receipts into a notebook, for example, so you can see how much you spent. (Try not to be too scared to look at the results at the end of the year.) Or you could create an applet to save all emails from a particular sender to Evernote. Connect Gmail to Evernote Facebook: Whether you know it or not, you’ve been keeping a diary. Every time you post a status on Facebook, you’re capturing a tiny snippet of your life. Maybe you’re announcing that you got a new car or a job, sharing a favorite meme, video, photo, or article, or pouring out your heart to your sympathetic audiences. With the IFTTT applet that saves your Facebook statuses in Evernote , you have a rich, multimedia journal that you can share, embellish, reflect upon, and reminisce. C onnect Facebook to Evernote Reddit: Reddit is an avalanche of information, opinions, advice, and more, and dedicated Redditors swear by its old-school format. But if you’re collecting a particular type of information, Reddit can be difficult to navigate. Save popular productivity tips from Reddit’s /r/productivity subreddits so that you can review them later. Or, if there’s another topic you’re following, use this IFTTT applet to create a note in Evernote whenever you save a post on Reddit. Connect Reddit to Evernote Dropbox: Did you know that you can copy files saved in Dropbox to Evernote ? The benefit of duplicating Dropbox files is the powerful search functionality that Evernote offers. It might be difficult to find files in Dropbox, but Evernote will find notes based on any remembered word in the document, including handwriting and words captured in images. Connect Dropbox to Evernote WordPress: Bloggers appreciate the IFTTT applet that allows them to create content in Evernote and then post it directly to WordPress blogs . Naturally, you’ll want to pop over to WordPress to ensure that the HTML and formatting are correct, but the real magic here is the ability to create, post, and archive content in once place. You’ll find applets that go the opposite way (saving posts from WordPress to Evernote) and applets that do the same things for Medium . Connect WordPress to Evernote Android and iOS: There is no shortage of IFTTT applets connecting iOS and Android devices to Evernote, and they have pretty much the same functionality across platforms. There are applets for saving photos and contacts to Evernote, logging calls , turning your reminders into checklists in Evernote, and creating to-do lists. Browse all Evernote applets Some applets you see may seem silly. Why, you ask, do you need to s ave your Feedly favorites in Evernote when you can simply save them…in Feedly? It’s not as strange as it seems. Evernote not only gives you a higher level of search functionality , but it also provides context . For example, if you’ve saved an article in Feedly to read later, and IFTTT copies it into Evernote, Evernote will offer suggestions for other notes on the same or related subject that you might have forgotten about. A word of caution: it’s easy to forget you have an IFTTT applet running. Some applets create individual notes every time the applet is triggered. Make sure you really want IFTTT to do what you ask of it—because it will. Using IFTTT to connect Evernote with the other apps and services you use every day means you can increase your productivity without having to lift a finger.  IFTTT makes it possible to save a lot of time, but there may be a little time investment up front. However you use it, IFTTT helps you get more from Evernote by automating tasks that would otherwise be too labor-intensive to do manually. Do you have favorite IFTTT applets for Evernote?

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Becoming More Human, One Dataset at a Time", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/becoming-more-human-one-dataset-at-a-time/", "abstract": "If a picture is worth a thousand words, then Giorgia Lupi , an award-winning information designer, has written volumes. While “big data” has become a buzzword for many of us, Giorgia’s goal is to make data ‘smaller’—breaking it into human-sized, contextual pieces, expressing those concepts visually, then wrapping them in meaningful stories. Her passion began in childhood. Without other siblings around to play with (or to pester), Giorgia often found herself spending hours being entertained by a piece of paper and a handful of pencils. Sometimes she’d even entertain her parents by ‘exhibiting’ her artwork at home, drawing on the walls just to get their attention. Having grown up with a love of drawing as a young child, and after studying architecture and completing a Ph.D. in Information Design, Giorgia went on to co-found Accurat , a data-driven design firm. Giorgia is on an ongoing quest to explore how data can effectively draw out people’s humanity—to help them connect with themselves and others at a deeper level. Giorgia views big data as something that “no longer [exists in] a utopian future. It’s a commodity. And the more ubiquitous data becomes, the more challenging it will be to make it personal.” In 2013, a chance encounter at a data design festival sparked a remarkable collaboration. Like Giorgia, information designer Stefanie Posavec also preferred hand-drawn data visualizations over the use of standard, data coding systems. They decided to embark on a challenge to see if they could get better acquainted through the exchange of ‘data drawings.’ Stats that tell a story For 52 consecutive weeks, Giorgia and Stefanie put their personal lives under a metaphorical microscope and meticulously gathered ‘small data,’ details about the particulars of their daily lives. They noticed and noted both public and private thoughts and actions, such as how often they checked the time, how many times they said “thank you,” what types of things they laughed about, or how often they had to make decisions. Each designer transformed her weekly data into thoughtfully illustrated postcards which they exchanged via postal mail. What began as a personal project between two ‘data pals’ has now become a visually delightful book entitled Dear Data , and soon, a permanent exhibition at MoMA in New York. Data as art? Absolutely. In place of technical drawings and detailed graphs (typically found in data science books), Dear Data shows how raw information can be transformed into an organic, personal story. Just before Giorgia headed off on a book tour, we had an opportunity to catch up with her to glean her unique insights into note taking, organizing, and creativity. Note taking and the art of noticing Whether it’s for work or for leisure, Giorgia can often be caught sketching or taking notes. With sketchpad (or iPad) in hand, she is ready to draw anything or any one that crosses her path. In fact, sketching has become a daily ritual and, perhaps, a bit of an obsession for Giorgia. “I draw before I think…Every dinner or social, I pull out paper and pens,” she confesses. It’s her way of noticing her surroundings and staying focused. “[Drawing] keeps my mind from wandering,” she adds. Giorgia’s #stalkingdrawings Grateful for friends who kindly tolerate her compulsive drawing habits, Georgia has amassed a collection of illustrations unashamedly referred to as “ stalking drawings .” Because of her knack for noticing and note taking, she’s captured countless memories spent with friends over beer, pizza, or coffee. Giorgia’s drawings capture everyday moments PRO TIP: Use the Evernote in-app camera to quickly snap photos of hand-drawn sketches and handwritten notes on any piece of paper (like a napkin!). Add it to a shared notebook that your colleagues or friends can view or edit. Once saved to Evernote, any legible text in an image is searchable: Learn more . Organization: Outer order that brings inner peace Giorgia unashamedly admits that she’s “really, really obsessed with organization.” She adds, “All my papers and pens need be lined up on the table, parallel to each other.” Organization, for Giorgia, has a calming effect. She’s come to believe that, “Not only do we organize to find things easier, but we also organize because outer order brings inner peace.” “Not only do we organize to find things easier, but we also we organize because outer order brings inner peace.” This fascination with organization extends to Giorgia’s to-do lists, which she frequently rewrites and reorders. For week 10 of the Dear Data project, Giorgia wanted to find out how frequently she modifies her Evernote to-do lists . To keep her data organized and her visualization meaningful, Giorgia used dashes (–) as a symbol to denote each individual item in a to-do list, with variations indicating attributes and actions for each item. Giorgia’s visualization of data gathered from the ‘Week 10: To-do Lists’ project The detailed legends on the back of each Dear Data postcard do more than explain and organize the data. They are also helpful for tracking and identifying weekly patterns and trends, which leads Giorgia to glean deeper insights about performance, human behaviors, and values. For example, much can be deduced from the patterns found in Giorgia’s “Week of Laughter” drawings depicting ‘laughter’ data. From a quick scan of the ‘Week 42’ postcard, one could deduce that Giorgia has a pretty good relationship with her colleagues at Accurat. They all work together in an office, but also seem to have a lot of fun while doing it. Giorgia’s ‘bouquet of laughter’ from Week 42  (on the right) of the Dear Data book PRO TIP: Create a good organization system in Evernote by keeping notebooks or tags consistent. This makes it easier for you to find and sort your notes. Using naming conventions with note titles also makes it easier to find and organize notes. Add prefixes, numerals, and symbols to your titles as a way to group similar notes together. To view lists by note title, d isplay your note list using the ‘Side list view,” then sort by ‘Title. Learn more. Creativity: Drawing inspiration from cross-curricular sources To cultivate creativity and keep ideas fresh, Giorgia finds inspiration from a variety of sources, including geometry, science, and various elements in nature. She also spends time exploring abstract art, musical scores, and Pinterest boards for ideas. Recently Giorgia and her Accurat team worked on a data visualization project for Popular Science magazine that was inspired by musical notations . Illustrations from Accurat’s data visualization project for Popular Science Ideas come and go, in different shapes and forms, at unexpected times, and in unexpected places. Whenever Giorgia finds shapes and patterns she likes, she attempts to draw and redraw them, paying particular attention to the aspects that pique her interest. Even the most prosaic objects can be sources of inspiration: Earlier this year, she spotted a pair of glasses on the table, reproduced it as a line drawing, and proceeded to create a pattern with it. “…to keep ideas fresh, Giorgia finds inspiration from a variety of sources, including geometry, science, and various elements in nature.” When Giorgia went about collecting data for weekly experiments, she also needed to be creative and flexible in the way she captured that information. The first day of each week, she might start out by jotting down some notes on paper. If her computer or phone were nearby, however, she’d jot some text notes in Evernote to keep them all in one place—synced to and accessible from all her devices. Other examples: For the ‘Week of Indecision’ experiment, Giorgia used the ‘Reporter’ app. For the ‘Week of Belongings’ experiment, Giorgia camped out for some time in her wardrobe to draw the layout of her clothes and shoes in her sketchbook. For the ‘Week of Clocks’ experiment, Giorgia took screenshots of a digital clock on her phone or her laptop. In this way, the process of data collection became as much an exercise in creativity as the postcards themselves. PRO TIP: Use Evernote on your mobile phone, so you’re ready to capture thoughts and ideas at any time. Save an audio recording of an inspiring lunchtime conversation (with permission of course!). Snap a photo of a wine bottle label at a party. Use your finger to scribble or sketch a digital drawing inside a note. Save an interesting news article to Evernote from your mobile web browser. Learn more. Clearly, Giorgia and Stefanie are thrilled about the success of their Dear Data book. What’s been even more exciting, however, is seeing how their book has started to change the way people view data. Now, instead of describing data as ‘boring,’ ‘objective,’ ‘impersonal,’ and ‘complex,’ she meets people who describe it as ‘elegant,’ ‘humane,’ and even ‘whimsical.’ It has been especially satisfying to see a growing community of adults and children all starting to create and post their own data visualization drawings online. People, all over the world, have begun to notice and share personal details about their everyday lives, and in turn, connect with themselves and others more deeply than ever.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "5 Tips for Increasing Your Writing Productivity", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/5-tips-for-increasing-writing-productivity/", "abstract": "Last month, thousands of writers around the world took the ultimate writing challenge: writing a 50,000-word novel in 30 days as part of National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo. Participants wrote furiously, checking their online productivity statistics on the NaNoWriMo website . The writers tracked  the number of words people wrote, without worrying too much about quality. The task was to produce a certain number of words in a finite time. It begs the question: what is writing productivity? The Internet is full of advice on how to write productively, but never defines it. Writing is one of those activities that depend almost entirely on how your mind works. Many years of writing copy for high-tech companies have made me deadline-driven to produce high-quality, clean content on a regular basis, and the finished piece is a lot shorter than a novel. NaNoWriMo authors, after their 30-day sprint, can now come back to their work and ensure quality, and they may look at productivity in a different way. Time is no longer a factor, but attention to detail and writing quality over many hundreds of pages takes center stage. Whatever your story, (see what I did there?) your writing productivity requires discipline. Here are five tips for how I manage my writing productivity. Some may find my approach a little unorthodox so your mileage may vary. 1. Be prepared to write anywhere. If you search the Internet for tips on how to write productively, you’ll find that many of them require you to have the perfect environment and no distractions. To me, it isn’t realistic to ask the world to stop because you’re writing. We live in a noisy world. We have to set up an internal space to write, not an external one. War reporters wrote from the trenches; news reporters churned out stories from the bullpens of newsrooms full of conversation, ringing phones, and the clattering of typewriters. Even in total isolation, the noise coming from our brains can shout over what we’re trying to write. The Hindu have a concept of samadhi in which one finds internal quiet. Practice finding that, filtering out the noise around you. When your mind is ready, your location doesn’t matter. We live in a noisy world. We have to set up an internal space to write, not an external one. 2. Don’t seek outside approval before you’re finished. Looking for validation too early is my #1 downfall. Some people write for attention. (Don’t believe me? Spend five minutes on Twitter.) They crave instant audience, immediate gratification. If you recognize that quality in yourself, develop some iron-clad self-control. You’ll be tempted, after you’ve written a paragraph that particularly pleases you, to show it to someone. Resist. The minute you’ve gotten your attention fix, you’ll lose interest in what you’re writing. It will be next to impossible to come back to it, and you won’t finish the story, article, report, or book you’re working on. 3. Know your body rhythms. You probably already know the time of day you’re at your best. There are morning people and night people. (Wars could be fought over whether it’s better to work early or late, but no one would show up at the same time.) If it is at all possible, write when you feel you’re most creative. For those of us who write for a living, that isn’t always possible. I’m a night owl. My writing doesn’t start to get good until around 3:00 in the afternoon, and I can go until about 11. Those hours aren’t terribly conducive to a corporate job, so I focus everything I have on the three or four hours I’m at my best and spend the rest of the time doing other tasks. If you’re better in the morning, write then. Trying to force your body into doing something that goes against its natural rhythm may not lead to the most productive writing. 4. Use distractions wisely. A lot of other blog posts on productive writing urge you to turn off the Internet. Your mind may work a little differently, so pay attention to your brain when it comes to using distraction as a creativity tool. You may need to look away from what you’re writing for a few minutes to flush out your thoughts and start again. The Internet is perfect. So are magazines, taking a walk, looking out the window, or my favorite, a puppy or kitty break. Distraction for productivity is a technique that requires self-control. You have to know when enough is enough and it’s time to get back to work. And a word of warning: your boss might not agree that a five-minute Facebook or YouTube break is good for your creativity. Use your judgment. If you don’t make a mistake in the first place, you won’t have to fix it later. 5. Ideas first, grammar later. But…get to the grammar. If you’re writing for speed, and you don’t have a natural ability to ensure proper punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, and all that other grammar-geeky stuff as you go, don’t worry about it. Yes, this is really a professional copywriter telling you not to stress about the technical points of writing. Get your ideas on paper, and let your ideas give birth to baby ideas, and say everything that your heart and brain need to say. When you’re done, it’s time to drag out your copy of Strunk and White and visit your best friends at Grammarly.com. This part can be debilitating to your writing, though, if you don’t prep up front. Take a little time to understand the basics of grammar and style. Punctuation doesn’t matter when you send text messages (unless you’re texting me) but it will make all the difference in writing productively. If you don’t make a mistake in the first place, you won’t have to fix it later. Everyone will make some errors. Take the time to read over your work carefully and fix the problems, but don’t let the errors trip up your final output. Writing is personal. You have to know your body rhythms, brain patterns, and to understand your thoughts to be productive doing it. Defining productivity also depends entirely on your goal. It doesn’t matter if it’s a 50,000-word novel or a heartfelt thank you note. If you finish it and put it in the hands of a reader, you’ve been productive.", "date": "2016-12-13,"},

Experience is what happens in your brain. The slippery chill of diving into a swimming pool. The bittersweet taste of chocolate ice cream on your tongue. Those are experiences. Information is the breadcrumb trail left behind by experience. The photograph of you by the pool. The chocolate stain on your shirt. Information points back to previous experiences, and, if we choose to act on it, guides us toward the future. Take writing, for example. The rush of ideas, the mental blocks, the struggle for meaning—it’s all an experience. The words on the page, stark and cold, are the information left behind by the experience of writing. The purpose of writing is not to store facts for later. Well, it can be, if you’re writing down an address or phone number. But the purpose of writing down ideas is to document a thought process. When you go back and read what you wrote before, you are transported back to that experience of thought. You are able to pick up where you left off, and continue whatever journey you had embarked upon. Writing down ideas is not about saving information; it’s about time travel. I began by writing this idea as a note in Evernote about 8 or 9 months ago. Since that time, my daughter was born, I went on paternity leave, I changed 10,000 diapers, I came back to work, I did a couple of projects, I went on vacation, and I came back from vacation…a lot of stuff happened. But when I revisited this writing today, I was able to transport myself right back to what I was thinking when I started it so many months ago. I remember the ideas bouncing around in my head as I rode my bike home that day in the half-light of dusk. I remember what it felt like, sitting on the couch with my laptop after dinner, feet on the coffee table. I remember the melancholic vibration between my ears as the ideas took shape. All this burst forth onto the stage of my consciousness as I re-read the visual descriptions that open the piece. Writing down ideas is not about saving information; it’s about time travel. You could say the same about taking notes. In school, we learn that it’s virtuous to take notes. Somehow it helps you learn, or something. But why? Sure, you might get down a few facts and figures that could be useful if you have to write a paper, but couldn’t you just Google it? The thing is, the real reason to take notes is not to capture facts and figures. It’s much more important to leave enough information behind that you can transport yourself back to the frame of mind you were in during the experience of learning something. You can rekindle any ideas that might have been sparked as you watched the lecture or presentation. You can return to the experience and make something from it. The author’s sketch notes from ConFab 2016 In my case, I do sketch notes exclusively now. It’s not because I’m a fancy designer and want to show off my drawing skills, which are rather primitive. No. I do sketch notes because I’ve found that doodling while people talk leaves behind much richer information that allows me to transport myself back to the experience more effectively. Drawing and writing together activate more of the receptive/intuitive/creative parts of my brain, which actually makes the experience itself richer. So when, months later, I transport myself back to the experience of the conference or class through the medium of information, I can see the past world in higher resolution. Thomas Edison famously captured and collected his ideas in some five million pages of notes over the course of his life. Was he a megalomaniacal narcissist, obsessed with documenting his own brilliance? Perhaps. But I think he was more interested in time travel. He knew that the spark of an idea is the most transcendent experience in the world, and he wanted to leave himself some information so he could find his way back. You can live life as a one-way street—time rushing senselessly forward as experiences fade behind you. But technology—beginning with the written word and evolving to the machine-aided capture and organization tools of today—gives you another option. Collecting, developing, and revisiting information expands your creative potential because you can draw from the sum total of your life, not just the fleeting thoughts of the moment. You can live life as a complete whole and create from the full depths of your well.", "date": "2016-12-21,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Effective Brainstorming Techniques", "author": ["Michael Gaylord"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/effective-brainstorming-techniques/", "abstract": "Brainstorming is one of the best ways to generate ideas and solve problems, alone or in a group. There’s no substitute for the free, improvisational flow of ideas, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think ahead. Here are some tips and techniques for getting the most out of your brainstorming sessions. Brainstorm your brainstorm If you’re asked to lead a team brainstorm, but you’re new to it, preparation is key. While you’ll want to focus much of your pre-brainstorm time on strategy and research around your topic, you should also let the world be your spark. Use Evernote to collect any potential fodder you find as you go through your day, whether you’re on the train headed to work, in Pilates class, or catching up on the news. Break the ice before storming those brains In any brainstorm, there’s usually a handful of people who do most of the talking, while others only pipe up when asked to share. To help everyone in the room find a voice, start with an icebreaker, such as “Tell us something about you that might surprise people.” Their answers can warm up the room and forge quick bonds creating the safe, welcoming environment crucial to effective brainstorming . Remind your group (or yourself, if you’re going it alone), to treat every idea with respect, and stay supportive instead of tearing down unusual ideas. If working with a group, set time limits to keep the ideas flowing and ensure that the floor is open for everyone. Let the sparks—and new ideas—fly, but try not to drill down too deeply into a single idea at the expense of the collaborative brainstorm. Once you’ve set the tone, clearly present the problem or challenge. Ask the group, “What does success look like?” Take some time to look at what your competitors are doing to see what’s worth emulating and what’s not. Instead of asking for answers, you can also use the “starbursting” technique, where questions stir up new questions. For instance, when thinking about a new product offering, questions like “What features should we include?” or “What would our customer look like?” help everyone gauge a new idea. Jeff Sanders , a leading productivity coach, Evernote user, and author of the Amazon best-selling book on productivity, The 5 AM Miracle: Dominate Your Day Before Breakfast , keeps a notebook at the ready to capture the lightning in a bottle that often strikes during a brainstorming session. “I schedule focused blocks of time for creative, problem-solving brainstorming sessions,” he says, adding, “I prefer 30-60 minute blocks where I can focus exclusively on answering one question that solves a problem in my current project. I record every new idea into a new note to capture the entire process.” Get everyone involved Aside from sticking to time limits and keeping a lid on lengthy discussions, you can balance the participation among attendees with these techniques: Generate a mind map . A mind map is a way to visualize and analyze your goal, task, or challenge. You can create a mind map with pencil and paper or by using one of several available mind-mapping apps. Or, open a note to quickly capture ideas as the visual representation of your collaborative thoughts take shape. Write it down . Have people write down ideas on a slip of paper. If you set a time limit and solicit ideas anonymously, people will have less time to show off or be concerned about what others will think of their ideas. Round Robin . Have the group stand in a circle. Once the topic is given, each person throws out an idea, which the moderator records. No one evaluates ideas until after everyone shares. Step Ladder . This technique is useful when you have ringleaders in your group who may try to commandeer the conversation. As the facilitator, you share the topic and everyone leaves the room, except for two team members. After they discuss their ideas, another teammate joins them and presents his or her idea to the other two before the previous two discuss theirs. This process is repeated until everyone is in the room again, sharing all the ideas together. Pass it On . Give everyone 30 seconds to write an idea on a sheet of paper, and then have them pass it to the next person, who adds to it. Keep the idea sheet going around the room until everyone has added their thoughts. Seeing each other’s ideas helps generate new ones, and writing them down instead of saying them out loud can be easier for shy contributors. This is another way for participants to share ideas and add to your brainstorm notebook using Evernote. Mix it up Make your brainstorm fun and engaging by holding your meeting in an exciting spot. A change of location encourages visual thinking, playing new roles, and taking it to the edge. Here are some ideas: Take it offsite . Go to a unique space such as a conference room at a zoo, museum, or local theater. Any place that’s not your usual work environment can start those wheels moving. Be crafty . Nix the words and have your team draw or shape their ideas out of art supplies, toys (Play-Doh ® is a good one), or found objects—then snap photos to capture the moment. Or send everyone on a 10-minute web-surfing treasure hunt with Evernote Web Clipper and see what visual gems they unearth. Role play . Reverse course and argue opposite viewpoints, or ask your group to express ideas from outside perspectives. “How would a five-year-old handle this?” or “What would would Luke Skywalker do?” are great idea sparks. Go to the Edge . Try Seth Godin’s “Edgecraft” technique . Rather than focussing on your core business — for instance selling airline seats — brainstorm things on the fringes of your business, like what kinds of unique snacks you might hand out during a flight. You’ll start seeing your problems from the outside looking in. Keep the momentum Jeff Sanders tells us, “ After brainstorming, I sift through the ideas and pluck out only the best ones to be stored in a project-specific notebook.” To keep things going, encourage everyone to continue storming on their own or in small groups, adding new ideas, sketches, and web content—whatever spurs their imagination after they return to their desks. Follow-through is also important. Make sure that people responsible for post-brainstorm outcomes understand their roles and the team’s expectations, and check in at key milestones as new ideas are being implemented. You can always schedule another group brainstorm if people get stuck. Tips to get the most out of Evernote for your brainstorm Prepare for your brainstorm by opening a note to quickly capture ideas and save photos you’ve taken. Quickly grab and save articles, pictures, and videos you find on the web with Web Clipper . Check out mind-mapping apps that integrate with Ev ernote, such as ConceptDraw MINDMAP . If your team uses Evernote, have them record and share their “Write it Down” or “Pass it On” ideas. This can become part of your brainstorm notebook. Create a shared, post-brainstorm notebook where your team can continue to add new ideas, sketches, pictures, and web content after the brainstorm is over. The end of the brainstorm is just the beginning. Wrap things up by thanking everyone for participating. Your heartfelt appreciation will make people feel good about their contributions and lay the groundwork for positive and productive brainstorming sessions in the future.", "date": "2017-01-7,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Albert Einstein’s Unique Approach to Thinking", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/einsteins-unique-approach-to-thinking/", "abstract": "“I never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking.” — Albert Einstein In the arena of scientific achievement and the quest to discover genius, Albert Einstein stands alone. He remains a profoundly important figure who undertook extraordinary, groundbreaking work that not only shaped the pillars of modern physics but greatly influenced the philosophy of science. Quite literally, Einstein changed the way we see and travel across the world and cosmos. He was responsible for the world’s most famous equation and for discovering the theory of relativity, considered to be mankind’s highest intellectual discovery. Einstein went about his work in unique ways. From visualization to daydreaming and even a dash of musical inspiration, Einstein’s creative insights and philosophical vantage points help guide the work we tackle today. The power of play “A new idea comes suddenly and in a rather intuitive way. But intuition is nothing but the outcome of earlier intellectual experience.” — Albert Einstein Einstein took breaks from his work to play the violin. Beethoven favored “long, vigorous walks” in which he carried a pencil and blank sheet music. Mahler, Satie, and Tchaikovsky all believed in the power of the regularly-scheduled mid-day walk. For some, it’s walks and breaks in the day. For others, it’s applying time to deep interest in areas that are completely different from their professional work. From music to painting, the pursuit of creative endeavors has the ability to help us discover and connect what we know to what we aspire to know. He viewed taking music breaks as an important part of his creative process. In addition to music, he was a proponent of ‘combinatory play’ — taking seemingly unrelated things outside the realms of science (art, ideas, music, thoughts), and blending them together to come up with new ideas. It’s how he came up with his most famous equation , E=mc 2 . “Combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought,” Einstein wrote in a letter (italicized in part below) to Jacques S. Hadamard, who was studying the thought process of mathematicians. “…Words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be “voluntarily” reproduced and combined…but taken from a psychological viewpoint, this combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought — before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others.”  —Albert Einstein Creativity can’t be taught, but it can be harnessed and embraced. Nothing stokes the fires of our creative wants more than the thought of instantaneous creative inspiration—the lightning bolt or apple falling from the sky. In reality, creativity blossoms when you feed it like a fire hungry for more logs. And, creativity reaches its maximum potential when it’s stoked in combination with knowledge, ideas, and skills you’ve acquired throughout life. It’s why filmmakers seek out inspiration in art museums and why composers find notes in the daily music of everyday life. Ideas and interludes As Maria Popova, author of Brainpickings writes, organic synthesis of ideas happens when we step back and examine the patterns. Don’t mistake these moments for the illustrious and oft-debated lightning bolt of inspiration, even though they can happen while we are walking, showering, or even meditating. Think of them as important moments that are part of a sequential creative process that happen while we work and play. Think of the work as peering through the lens of a microscope in a lab, and the creativity starts to percolate when you take a break from the lab, pick up an instrument, or go for a walk. These interludes helped Einstein connect the dots of his experiments at opportune moments when he picked up the violin. “I fell in love with Albert because he played Mozart so beautifully on the violin,” recalled his second wife, Elsa . “He also plays the piano. Music helps him when he is thinking about his theories. He goes to his study, comes back, strikes a few chords on the piano, jots something down, returns to his study.” Beauty in the science “This kind of mental play uses both unconscious and conscious thinking: scanning various stimuli and information, perceiving patterns and clear or hidden similarities between things or ideas, and playing with their interconnections, relationships, and links,” notes researcher Victoria Stevens , who explored the neuroscience of creativity in To Think Without Thinking . Stevens notes that the link between problem solver and creative thinker is essential. “Combinatory play provides a fertile field for neuroaesthetic investigation into the direct link between play, imagination, creativity, and empathy,” she writes. While this imaginative combinatory play was an essential part of Einstein’s productive thought, the same type of thinking and a playful nature are essential to all artistic creations. “Personally, I experience the greatest degree of pleasure in having contact with works of art,” Einstein said. “They furnish me with happy feelings of intensity that I cannot derive from other sources.” Einstein’s work was greatly influenced by art, and influenced artists, in turn. Salvador Dali’s surrealist work has roots in the tiniest scientific elements of Einstein’s work. Dali had great interest in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics, and these atomic particles are the foundation of his painting The Persistence of Memory , thought by some to represent the flexing of time. Daydreaming FTW Einstein’s early academic and learning struggles are often debated . As a 15 year old, he dropped out of school. Einstein left school because his teachers didn’t approve of visual imagination for learning, skills which became fundamental to his way of thinking. “Imagination is more important than knowledge,” Einstein would say. It’s no coincidence that around the same time, Einstein began to use thought experiments that would change the way he would think about his future experiments. His first, at age 16, saw him chasing after a light beam which would help launch his discovery of special relativity. His innate ability to conceptualize complex scientific details became a hallmark of his research. His work on gravity was influenced by imagining riding a free-falling elevator. This flight of fancy eventually led him to understand that gravity and acceleration were essentially the same. Using these simple thought experiments, Einstein was able to understand that time and space are both shaped by matter—the basis for the theory of general relativity. It’s astonishing that this thought exper iment changed everything we thought we knew about the universe. Newton’s ideas of the universe were one-dimensional, but Einstein proposed that our universe was four dimensions, where stars, planets, and celestial bodies formed a “fabric” that were dynamically influenced by the bending and curving of gravitational pull. Only recently has mankind been equipped to explore much of what his theory had proposed—supernovas, black holes, and the evolution of our solar system. An enduring legacy Nearly a century later, Einstein’s legacy remains strong as ever. His theories of gravity, space, and time continue to influence a new generation of scientists. As Einstein continued his work, he maintained a natural sense of understanding of the world and compassion and kindness about people around him. It’s only fitting that he was very aware of the incredibly short time we have on this planet, while at the same time understanding that all the work he accomplished was directly related to those who came before him. It’s comforting to know that he realized his work would be instrumental for all those who had yet to arrive. “ How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people…a hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving,” Einstein said .", "date": "2017-01-11,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Facebook Live: A More Organized 2017 at Home", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/facebook-live-a-more-organized-2017-at-home/", "abstract": "As we move in and get cozy with 2017, one of the first things we all want to do is look at how we can make New Year’s resolutions a reality. Evernote is all about digital organization and productivity, but our physical spaces matter, too. That’s why we invited Sam from Simply Organized to join us in a Facebook Live event to talk about how to begin organizing at home. Sam, whose specialty is working with families, goes into homes and helps people arrange their space in ways that make sense to them. She’s an expert when it comes to shelving, drawers, bins, and boxes, and says she reaches a state of zen when folding items to put away. Though she works primarily with mothers with small children, she’s also helped empty-nest families with downsizing once the children have grown. “Organization is really about simplifying things,” Sam told Josh Zerkel, Evernote’s Director of Community. “It’s about solving a problem, and being able to find what you need easily.” Sam advised not to strive for perfection when you’re organizing your space. “Social media makes you think everything is perfect,” she said. “But those photos are art-directed. Nobody lives in those spaces. You need to live in your space, and living is sometimes a little bit messy.” Know the difference between organization and tidying up Sam tells her clients that one of the keys to conquering home organization is having systems that will help you keep things in order. “Organizing is solving the bigger problem,” she explained. “You have to have a place to put everything to tidy up.  But, as she told the thousands of live viewers, organization doesn’t have to mean buying more things to contain your clutter. “I love to organize with no containers,” she said. “You have to learn to fold certain ways. (Organizing) is not about the container. You do have to have the right shelf or cubbies. But that doesn’t mean you have to spend a fortune.” When she does have to buy new containers,, Sam likes to follow retail stores’ sales cycles. She knows when storage items will have the deepest discount, and buys the items then. Until then, she reminded the audience, “you can reuse boxes you already have, or get great stuff at the dollar store.” Where to start One of the biggest challenges anyone faces when starting to organize their home is just that—knowing where to begin. You may be overwhelmed by the sheer number of rooms you’d like to tackle. Is it the kitchen? A bedroom? A closet? The living room? Sam suggests thinking before you start—what room is your pain point? Often, Sam said, it’s the garage. “It’s your point of entry,” she explained. “It’s the first thing you see; it’s what you’re coming home to. For most homes, the garage is this collection area. Maybe you want a gym or an art studio, and changing a garage can be really satisfying.” Though not everyone has a garage, the point is, she recommends starting at the first thing you see when you walk in the door. Seeing clutter when you first walk in can cause stress, and your home should be a sanctuary. Organization pitfalls There’s no need to get overwhelmed by the enormity of the task at hand, Sam advised. Set a timer for just a small amount of time—15 or 20 minutes should do it—grab a trash bag and start finding items to throw away. “There are so many bags of trash you’ll collect,” she said. “I don’t mean donations. I mean actual trash.” Before you can organize, she said, you need to “edit” your home. Remove items that you won’t want to keep. Focus on one area and stay within your timer. Josh, who’s a Certified Professional Organizer himself, added that building organizational skills is really the same as developing a new muscle. You can’t get it all at once. It takes a lot of short-duration practice sessions to build the muscle, but the key is to stay focused, and not to start too many projects at once. “Start with one project at a time, and don’t start another one until you’re finished.” When emotional baggage is physical Both Josh and Sam agree that emotion is at the heart of any organization project. Many people run into a problem with what Sam calls “sentimental clutter.” These are the things you’ve collected in the past that have no purpose but bring back happy memories. You’re not using these things, but you can’t justify getting rid of them, either. They are, without a doubt, useless clutter, but they trigger an emotion. “Start by understanding the trigger,” Sam suggested.  “What is it that’s bringing up those feelings for you? These are items of clutter that are based on memory. With items like this, go easy on yourself.” This is where Evernote comes in,” Josh added. “You can take pictures of those things. Tagging each item by the memory they trigger can be as valuable as having the actual thing. That’s a good way to bridge the gap between keeping everything and running out of space.” “If they can do it at school, they can do it at home” Sam, a mother of three, says that school teachers are some of the most powerful organizers in the world. “There is no chaos in a classroom,” Sam said. “There are systems. Kids know that if they take something out, they have to put it back. Everything is always clearly labeled. If the kids know how to do this at school, there’s no reason they can’t do the same thing at home.” She tells moms to look at their children’s classroom for inspiration, and follow the same system. When to get help Live viewers wanted to know when you know it’s time to hire a professional organizer. People are often reticent to bring organizers into their homes for a variety of reasons—they understand they have a problem, but they have mixed feelings about allowing a stranger to see and even touch their home and belongings. Clients often feel they’re being judged. “When you feel the stuff is taking over your life, it may be time to bring in an organizer,” Sam said. “If it’s taking you forever to get out the door, you’re late—that’s a good time.” She points out that the process doesn’t have to be invasive. “Professional organizers don’t have to touch your stuff. We can do a consult.” “It’s not like you see on TV,” Josh laughed. “We don’t come in and throw everything you own out and make jokes. That’s television. We give you the time and space you need to make decisions.” For more tips from Sam, follow Simply Organized on Instagram , Facebook , and her blog . Though Sam’s practice is limited to parts of the Bay Area in California, you can find an association of professional organizers anywhere in the world. the National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO) can connect you with organizers all over the U.S., and at www.organisemyhouse.com/need-help/ you’ll find a list of associations who can help you find the right organizer for you in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Germany. Professional home and office organizers are also just a Google search away in Asia, South America, and Africa.", "date": "2017-01-18,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Make Resolutions Come True by Setting Intentional Goals", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/make-resolutions-come-true/", "abstract": "Why do we make resolutions we have no intention of keeping? Why do we join gyms in January but abandon them by the middle of February? Why do we abandon our resolutions so quickly? Does it stem from a lack of willpower? Do we have terrible habits?  Probably not. The most likely reason is we have no idea how to go about turning resolutions into goals. It’s not possible to change a behavior or a habit without constant awareness or a system to help you through it.There is a difference between having great intentions for your resolutions and taking intentional steps to make them happen. Here are five tips for setting intentional goals for 2017. “Why am I setting this goal?” It’s easy to want to achieve a goal. However, it’s nearly impossible to create a resolution that’s based on depriving yourself of something. Reframe the resolution to a positive: it’s not about what you’re taking away, it’s about what you’re getting. Is the resolution something you want, or is it to please someone else? Do you know why you want it? I How can you reward yourself on your journey in ways that make sense? (If your goal is weight-loss, for example, rewarding yourself for success with sugary foods may not be the best choice. If your goal is to save money, spending some of it after you’ve reached a milestone saving amount will be counter-productive.) Jot down your thoughts in Evernote and revisit them often. You may discover that a hastily-written New Year’s resolution has become a passion. You may find that you have a clearer view of what success looks like if you understand each resolution and strive to turn them into goals. Find a way to look at your goals every day If you’re a visually-oriented person, it might be easier for you to work toward something you can have in front of you every day. Create vision boards , mood boards , or a desktop wallpaper that keep your vision at the forefront of your mind. Keep goals simple and attainable When it comes to setting intentional goals, you must have focus. At the New Year, it’s easy to be overly ambitious. Concentrate on achieving one goal at a time. Make goals specific, measurable, and attainable . As the saying goes, your reach should exceed your grasp, but not so much that it’s impossible to stretch. What are benchmarks and timelines you can put in place? You can use Evernote to set a schedule, break your goals into smaller tasks, set reminders for each task, and track your progress. As you accomplish smaller tasks, you will build momentum toward your goals. Make sure that you’ve set realistic goals.You will not become a master chef this year, for example, if you are a beginner now. Know the difference between a goal and a wish Setting goals that depend on other people or outside circumstances is a recipe for disaster. Base your goals on you alone. If your goal depends on serendipity, it’s a wish, not a goal. It’s okay to have wishes. Some of them can even turn into goals if you plan accordingly. It’s unrealistic, for example, to set a goal to become a movie star. However, you can set a goal to move to Hollywood or to take acting lessons where you are. Or you can take steps to save money for the move. You may never become a movie star, but by setting incremental, achievable goals and following through on them, you have set the wheels in motion.  And any move forward is positive. It leads to new and different goals. Remember: You’re doing a phenomenal job Did you know that on average, people’s thoughts are up to 70 percent negative every day ?  Combat that never-ending chatterbox in your head. As you go through your day, practice telling yourself what you’re doing well.  “Today I didn’t press the snooze button on my alarm clock,” or “I took the flights of stairs at the office instead of the elevator.” We’ve always been taught to treat others with kindness and understanding, but we don’t know how to be kind to ourselves. Treat yourself well as you work toward making a New Year’s resolution into a goal. You’re changing your life, and you deserve the time and space to grow, try things, fail, recover, and learn, one step and day at a time. Didn’t get there today? Try again tomorrow.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Evernote Reaches the Cloud: Migration to Google Cloud Platform Complete", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-migration-to-google-cloud-platform/", "abstract": "Back in September, we announced that Evernote would be migrating to a modern, cloud infrastructure. We lost no time in getting started. Just one month after the announcement, we were already moving data to the Google Cloud Platform. We’re excited to announce that Evernote has successfully migrated our service to the cloud, and accomplished this with minimal impact on our customers. Because this migration took place in the background, you wouldn’t have noticed any changes to your day-to-day experience in Evernote. For engineers who understand the technical complexities involved with moving large amounts of data into the cloud quickly and safely, Evernote’s migration to the cloud was monumental. What we did To borrow from the analogy of moving to a new house: At first glance, Evernote’s new home in the cloud may not look all that different, but it’s built on a much stronger foundation, sits on a larger lot, comes with new plumbing, and even has an upgraded alarm system. Overall, it’s a much better place to live. Rather than pouring resources into the day-to-day maintenance of equipment and software required for running the Evernote service, we can now focus more of our time and energy into responding to customer needs. Though subtle at first, this move to the cloud will bring about more noticeable benefits in the not-so-distant future, such as increased uptime, security improvements, and faster delivery of new and innovative features. What we achieved Although every engineering endeavor is different and encounters unique challenges, cloud migration efforts of this magnitude usually take longer than expected (9-12 months) and consume more resources than originally estimated. Driven by our commitment to minimizing disruptions to your service, we did it in just 70 days. In this short time frame, we successfully moved 5 billion notes and 5 billion attachments over to our new cloud-based infrastructure. That’s over 3 petabytes of data. To give you some context, that’s equivalent to moving enough content to fill up 10+ copies* of all the books ever published in all of modern history. Although no physical moving vans or boxes were required, Evernote took extreme precautions to ensure that all the data was packaged properly, systematically organized, and safely transported. We started by transporting just a few items at a time, then moved more data over once we were 100% certain it was safe to do so. A faster, more reliable Evernote So what benefits can you expect to see once we’ve completely settled into our new home in the cloud? For many, Evernote is an extension of their minds, so security has always been of utmost priority. With encryption at rest and improved disaster recovery planning, we can provide an extra layer of protection for your thoughts and ideas. It’s common practice to encrypt data when it’s being transferred from one place to another so it can’t be read, even if it’s intercepted. The concept of ‘encryption at rest,’ however, means that your data is protected, even when it is not being moved anywhere. Disaster recovery planning ensures that we are better equipped to restore the Evernote service smoothly and quickly, in the unlikely event of a major disaster. What’s next? Now that we’ve hit our audacious goal and reached the cloud, we’re already putting these advantages to work. Stay tuned for more news as we build the next generation of Evernote—one that will help you get more done with speed, security, and peace of mind. For more technical details about how we achieved the cloud migration, visit the Evernote Tech Blog » * Note: There have been approximately 150 million books published in the modern world . Each book would take 2 MB of computer space to store. All books published in the modern world = 300 million MB = 0.3 PB. We moved 3 PB. This is equivalent to moving an estimated 10x the number of books have ever been published in all of modern history.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Organization for Small Business Offices—Give, Take, and Toss", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/organization-for-small-business-offices/", "abstract": "I see it every time I go to my accountant’s office. Stacks of papers on a water cooler. Tax files filling every shelf. Dog toys stacked in the corner. Better Homes and Gardens , August 2005 on the table. Personal memorabilia ( wow, an autographed picture of Sandy Koufax!  And is that…a high school homecoming picture from 1986? ) on the walls and tables. Traces of the stain on the rug where years ago, a baby I know did something unfortunate. My accountant has had a small, three-person office in the same location for decades. It is a comfortable, old-fashioned, nostalgic step back to a simpler time, and wholly inefficient. It was this office that popped into my mind when I spoke with Connie Anderson, Certified Professional Organizer (CPO), who specializes in helping small business offices like this one organize and take back control of their office environment. Connie Anderson, CPO Connie comes in and creates a clean slate for them. Her plan of attack is always the same: start with what she calls “the command post”—the owner’s desk. From there, she rebuilds an office space that makes all the employees look forward to coming to work every day. “They’re aware that they’re not functioning to their full capacity, and they know there’s too much outdated stuff bogging down what’s important right now,” Connie said. “Business owners are so busy and focused on keeping the business afloat; they don’t realize how bad it’s become. The tipping point is usually when they realize that they’re behind invoicing their clients, when they can’t find the tax documents they need, or they can’t remember who they invoiced and who is late in payments. The business owner panics when he or she doesn’t know where anything is.” “When there’s too much stuff, it’s impossible to be efficient. You don’t see what you need anymore.” “We clear off the desk completely,” Connie says. “We clean off all the dust and coffee stains. I have the owner sit down, take a deep breath, and say, ‘how do you want to feel at your desk? What image do you want to portray when clients or co-workers walk into your office?’” She admits that it’s often an emotional journey for her clients. She points to a classic scene from the beloved film Office Space , in which an employee clings to a red Swingline stapler as his familiar environment is torn apart around him. “People resonate with that,” she laughs. “People bring in items from outside of work that remind them there’s more to life than just work. They bring in something their child has made at school, certificates and awards they’ve received in years past, a plant symbolizes the outdoors, and freebees from conferences and trade shows—tote bags full of giveaways they’ve never looked at since.” Connie notes that there is a deeper meaning to all these ephemera. “If people need to be reminded of a life outside of work,” she says, “they’re not getting out to do it enough. The point of office organization is to bring these people back into a place where they can reclaim their life instead of just looking at pictures of the way they’d like it to be.” She is quick to remind customers that she’s not there to throw away all their beloved office mementos and toys, but to help owners and employees find the items that they connect with the most. “I had a client last week who had a tape dispenser shaped like a martini glass, and another tape dispenser that looked like a high-heeled shoe. Why does she need two?” Connie does not, however, rule out the possibility of rotating favorite items monthly. “But when it becomes layer upon layer, things lose their power to inspire and give you that break you need to re-energize,” she says. “This could also mean the type of pen you use. Does it feel good in your hand, do you like the color? Even the most basic of office supplies can be the source of emotional uplift.” Ready to go paperless? What about all the paper? In the office, Connie helps her clients move to a more paperless environment, and presents them with options for offsite storage of paper and files that aren’t accessed very often, or that are kept for archival purposes. But first, it’s necessary to cull paper that simply isn’t needed anymore. “We recycle and shred papers in filing cabinets,” she says. “We make sure the files are clearly labeled, and we review the flow of paperwork with the whole staff to make sure it doesn’t get out of hand again,” she says. Since everyone has a different opinion about such considerations, bringing people together to agree on an environment can be a challenge. Connie finds that generational work styles can be a challenge. “It’s typical of Millennials to work in a sleek, minimalist atmosphere,” she says. “And that’s fine. Some people are strongly paper-based, and others just grow up with technology. There’s no one right way to organize.” A caveat to that, Connie adds, is that every worker has to think about whether their work style projects the impression they want to give. “Younger workers are used to devices. They have no need to put pictures on desks or post-it notes on the walls. It’s all in their phones and electronic devices. If your file-and-paper systems stifle your productivity or reveal your age, it might be time to transition.” Connie is quick to point out that she understands that some people work better with visual cues and paper, and that’s okay. “It’s when desks are piled up with post-it notes that are nine months old that it gets to be a problem. When there’s too much stuff, it’s impossible to be efficient. You don’t see what you need anymore.” Negotiating for organized teams What does being organized mean? That’s a question that business teams must tackle with Connie, and it’s a multi-faceted discussion. When organizing a team, Connie serves as an organizing coach and facilitator, bringing groups together into a cohesive unit. “We need to understand each person’s organizing style,” she explains. “We need to consider learning disabilities that coworkers might not know about one another. Every team member has to buy in that organization is essential to the productivity of the team. Establishing that is the first step.” Team organization is always an emotional experience. Negotiation plays a big part in creating a united organizing front, and yes, a lot of times, people have to learn to change some habits.” Connie works with each team member to come up with their own solutions and systems that work within the newly-organized team processes. She also teaches employees to value the effort it takes to maintain organization. “We’re producing something every day,” she reminds clients. “There’s no end to staying organized. That’s why there has to be a system in place.” The key, she says, is coming together to create and maintain efficient office systems that work for every style. Through discussion, Connie’s office clients come to an agreement that works well for each particular office. “Talking about organizing style isn’t usually a topic that’s taught in a business setting, so when they meet with me, it’s often the first time that people have thought about how they can have an efficient day rather than just being told ‘this is how it works here.’ I offer a var i ety of solutions to get their brains thinking. Not all my ideas will be a good fit, but if they can stimulate their own solutions, I consider that a successful organizing solution.” Keeping home offices professional Many times, a small business is comprised of one person, and the office is in a home. Home office organization is just as important as a traditional office set up. Just because clients and employees don’t see the clutter, it doesn’t mean it isn’t affecting productivity. “You don’t see your own clutter after a while,” Connie acknowledges. “And in a home, the ‘creep’ from personal items is much easier. The home office becomes the landing place for laundry, storage, pictures, and unsorted shopping items.” That’s when bringing in a professional organizer like Connie can give you fresh eyes. “I believe everyone has an inner organizer,” she says. “It’s my job to bring it out. You get there by talking about what organizing means to you.” Just as it is in the outside office, organizing a home office is an emotional matter. Connie helps home business owners to visualize the upside of organizing as a way to make them understand the importance of it. “What’s on the other side?” she asks her clients, meaning, What will you get in exchange for taking the extra steps to stay organized?’ “Is it being able to get to hobbies you’ve been putting off? Inviting people over again? How do you want to feel when you open the door?” Considering these things helps people come to the conclusion that home office organization is not only necessary to productivity, but to the owner’s well-being. “I quote Kacy Paide, who wrote The Inspired Office , all the time,” Connie says. “Respect your space. If you don’t nobody else will.” Connie Anderson is a member of the National Association of Professional Organizers , which connects customers with organizers all over the United States. Similar organizations exist all over the world. At www.organisemyhouse.com/need-help/ you’ll find a list of associations that can help find the right organizer for you in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Germany. Professional home and office organizers are also just a Google search away in Asia, South America, and Africa.", "date": "2017-01-26,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "On Minimalism: A Solution to Gaining More Time", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/minimalism-a-solution-to-gaining-more-time/", "abstract": "At Evernote, we love productivity, but we also care about maintaining balance in our lives. This month, we’ll dive into how experts on minimalism stay productive without losing focus on what’s important. Busy is the problem Do you ever find yourself answering the question “how are you?” with “ Great! Really busy! ”? Wait, what? When did we start associating being busy with feeling great? Why do we do it? We live in a culture that values productivity, but too often we confuse the external signs of productivity (being busy) with the real thing. At work and at home, we spend countless hours on lengthy to-do lists. We may not realize it, but we’re drowning, putting in more hours than ever . We can’t keep up with it all, and yet we try by compulsively scanning multiple social media feeds. Business Insider claims that this alone takes up about a quarter of our time spent online. With every new productivity app that launches, we’re encouraged to get busier, become even more productive, and get more done so we can feel “great!” Meanwhile, our health is declining, and we don’t even have time for ourselves. Busy can’t be great. Busy is the problem. Minimalism, a solution to gaining more time If you want to live a calmer life, but don’t know where to begin, consider minimalism . Maybe you’ve heard of minimalism and how productive and stress-free those practicing it are, but you don’t understand what exactly minimalism is, or how to get started. Minimalism focuses on reducing consumption and possessions, improving work/life balance, and becoming more self-sufficient. Often referred to as simple living, minimalism emulates the lifestyles of ancient ways of living in a modern setting. Simple living is influenced by Buddhism, Taoism, and Monasticism–and all those philosophies that encourage simplicity, modesty, reflection, and embracing the art of letting go . Minimalism has evolved into a growing trend around the globe, largely due to best-selling authors and organizing consultants like Marie Kondo who have captured the world’s imagination with the KonMari Method of tidying up: a creative way of decluttering and adding value to the material things in our lives. Marie Kondo’s viral clothing folding tutorial. Minimalism begins with philosophies about reducing possessions, but it goes beyond the physical. It’s possible to apply minimalist thought to other aspects of your life, such as your relationships and your work. Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, better known as The Minimalists , have dedicated their lives to helping people adopt a minimalist lifestyle through the mediums of podcasts, documentaries, and books focused on topics like “ Letting Go of Sh*tty Relationships ” and creating meaningful work . Most of us want to do these things naturally, but have a difficult time achieving because we’re simply too busy getting things done to go about our lives in a more thoughtful way. The Minimalists speaking at TEDxFargo about the benefits of letting go and living a meaningful life with less. For some of us, taking on a minimalist approach to life is daunting. Maybe you have a large family or other factors to consider. But even if we have lots of commitments tying us down, minimalism is still an option. Take Becoming Minimalist , another group of experts on simple living. They’re a middle-class family of four with a typical home, regular people with normal lives. And yet, over the years, they’ve managed to take significant measures to live more intentionally and with fewer possessions. Joshua Becker and his family now spend their lives inspiring millions of people to live with less through their writing about both the joys and the struggles of their journey. Minimalism isn’t a goal that can be achieved quickly, nor is it a fad. Minimalism is a lifelong journey. It’s not an easy journey, and often, it may not even be very much fun. But with every life-decluttering change you make, you’ll find that you’ll have more time in your day to do what you love. Coming up From understanding the difference between being busy and being focused to working smarter instead of working longer, sometimes less is more. If you’re eager to learn more about living a minimalist life, stick around for parts 2 and 3 of this series, where we’ll talk with The Minimalists and Becoming Minimalist about how to get started. Are you taking any steps to simplify your life? We’d love to hear about them.", "date": "2017-02-1,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "5 Simple Ways to be More Productive with Evernote on Your Phone", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/5-ways-to-be-more-productive-with-evernote/", "abstract": "For some of us, smartphones have become one of the greatest threats to our productivity. For others, they are the greatest productivity tool ever invented. With Evernote, you can unleash the power of your handheld computer to optimize your productivity. 5 TIPS FOR HOW TO STAY PRODUCTIVE ON THE GO 1. Use Evernote widgets and quick note options Evernote widgets and quick note options were designed for taking notes at the speed of thought (ok, not quite that fast, but still pretty fast). Widget options With Evernote widgets, you can quickly jot down text notes, snap photos, and create reminders, all without opening the Evernote app. You can even set up the widget to display recently-viewed notes on the lock screen. Evernote widget options vary slightly on Android and iPhones . Quick note options If you already have Evernote open, long press the ‘new note’ button (‘ + ’) to view options similar to those found on the widget: record audio, snap a photo, or set up a reminder. iPhone 6s/6s Plus/7s/7s Plus, running iOS 10, come with the 3D Touch feature that lets you deep press Evernote from any Home screen to bring up all of the quick note options even faster. On Android, quick note options also include handwritten notes and file attachments. 2. Save and auto-save emails to specific project notebooks Many of you know how easy it is to save emails to Evernote . But, wait, there’s more—you can forward emails to a specific notebook so email content can live where any of your related project files, meeting notes, and online research already live. To save an email from your phone, simply open the email, forward it to your unique email address, and prepend the name of any personal notebook (like this: “@My Notebook”) in the ‘Subject’ line. The contents of your email will automatically be saved as new note in the specified notebook, without needing to open Evernote. Microsoft Outlook users can also use the Evernote add-in to clip Outlook emails directly into an Evernote notebook. This add-in, which has already been available on Mac and Windows for some time, is now on the Outlook mobile app for iOS . Automate email forwarding to Evernote If you find yourself frequently forwarding the same types of emails to Evernote, set up custom email filters to forward emails based on criteria such as, the sender or keywords in the subject line: Forward all emails sent from “Google Analytics” with the phrase “weekly report” in the subject line to your “Sales Reports” notebook. Append the contents of any emails labeled “Task” to a “Weekly Team Meetings” note by replacing the email subject line with “Weekly Team Meetings Note + “ Learn more » Explore IFTTT for more ways to auto-save Gmail messages to Evernote: Star any message in Gmail sent by a vendor to save its contents and the attached invoice as a new note in your ‘Vendor Invoices’ notebook. Automatically save receipts to Evernote by adding a label ‘tax receipts’ TIP : Set up email forwarding filters and automations on your desktop computer. Then, use your phone to trigger auto-forwarding by adding labels, stars, or updating subject lines. 3. Share notes and notebooks to minimize text messaging Why waste time sending frequent reminders to your project team to review meeting agendas week after week?  Share a URL link to a shared note or a shared notebook instead. Anyone you’ve shared the link with can view the contents of a shared note or notebook, even if they don’t use Evernote. Note: Individual business notes can be shared as URL links. In order to minimize the sharing of company information, business notebooks, however, cannot be shared as a URL link. When sharing project notebooks with others who use Evernote, you can set up note reminders to notify others whenever you add or update notes. Individuals who’ve joined your shared notebook can subscribe to email reminders and be notified of your changes. 4. Find things faster with search filters, saved searches, and shortcuts Evernote search filters, saved searches , and shortcuts are three secret weapons that can help you quickly find what you need, when you need it. Search filters Search filters let you exclude any notes you know aren’t relevant to your search. Save time by simply narrowing down your search results. iPhone – Evernote’s latest redesign of the iOS app comes with premade note tag and reminder filters. Tap the alarm clock button at the top of your note list to bring up a list of all the notes with reminders. Tap the tag button to bring up all the notes labeled with select tags. Android – Tap the ‘ Search ’ button (magnifying glass) at the top of any note list, enter search terms, tap ‘ Refine Your Search ’, then select a search filter, such as ‘ To-Do’s ’ (to bring up any notes with checklists). Tap ‘ Apply filters ’ to see your search results. PRO TIP : Want to geek out on advanced searches and take search filters to another level? Learn more » Saved searches Saved searches make it easier for you to execute searches you frequently use. Once you’ve saved a set of search parameters (such as keywords and filters) as a ‘saved search’, you can select it at anytime to re-run it. Shortcuts If there are notes, notebooks, or tags you frequently refer to, save them as shortcuts to save yourself a few extra taps. The ‘ Shortcuts ’ button is found in the navigation menu (Android) or on the tab bar (iPhone). 5. Convert reminders into calendar events Evernote note reminders notify you to take some sort of action on a specific note. Once you’ve set up an alarm for your reminder, you’ll receive a notification email at the specified date and time. Afraid you’ll miss the email notification? Use the Cronofy calendar connector to automatically convert all your reminders into events on your calendar. With Cronofy connected to a calendar that syncs with your phone, you can reschedule, rename, and clear reminder notifications from your calendar, without ever needing to launch Evernote. Still prefer having a simple, task management app on your phone? Try Swipes , a to-do list app that was designed to work with Evernote on both Android and iPhones . Swipes is aptly named for the simple, swiping gestures that make it easy to manage your checklists. Task completed? Select the task and simply swipe right to check it off. Need more time? Swipe left to select a time to postpone the task for later. Modern life is increasingly dependent on how well we optimize our time and our resources. If smartphones have become, in a sense, our remote office, then Evernote is a virtual desktop where we can stay focused, and get things done, no matter where we are.", "date": "2017-02-10,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Turning an Elephant", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/turning-an-elephant/", "abstract": "Fifteen months ago, Business Insider called Evernote the first dead unicorn. While some might despair at such criticism, we took it as a challenge. In a conversation with Jason Lemkin last week at SaaStr Annual , I announced that we’re cash flow positive and in control of our financial destiny as a company. From here on, our operations will be self-funding, and we’re investing in new experiences that our users have told us would help them get more done. In the last year, we’ve added our 200 millionth user, doubled the number of paying users, moved three petabytes of data to the Google Cloud Platform, redesigned our Windows app and Evernote for iPhone, and begun winning awards again. But the thing I’m most proud of is the “Notable Herd” of Evernote employees that came together to achieve those milestones. To be sure, turning an elephant around isn’t easy. We had to have the courage and discipline to make some tough calls, tune out the noise, and focus on what users expect from us: making them organized and productive. Throughout this journey, I’ve been inspired by customers reaching out to tell us the amazing things they do with Evernote, from running logistics companies to producing records to conducting research. We couldn’t have gotten here without their encouragement, steadfast support from our community, and the resilience of a determined workforce who simply wouldn’t fail. But we’re just getting started. Building a service that could organize five billion notes from individuals and keep them in sync was an incredible challenge. These memories and thoughts are captured in every form from text to picture to voice and handwriting, and finding a way to retrieve the right note just when a user needs it was a great accomplishment. Now we are taking the next step, from helping people capture information to helping them put it to work. The technical challenges become even harder when you’re serving teams of people who all have different ways of organizing and that’s what we’re tackling now. At the end of 2015, I asked everyone to stay tuned as we began to turn this elephant, and I do so again today. We’re facing the right direction and ready to start charging.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "On Minimalism: The Difference Between Focused and Busy", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/the-difference-between-focused-and-busy/", "abstract": "At Evernote, we love productivity, but we also care about maintaining balance in our lives. This month, we’re diving into how experts on minimalism stay productive without losing focus on what’s important. In part one of this series, we discovered that there’s a difference between being busy and being happy. Between work, academics, family, and personal relationships, we don’t have much time left for ourselves. So what do we do about it? We’ve seen that minimalism is a viable solution to gaining more time in our day, so perhaps you’ve decluttered your home, knocked items off of your to-do list, and even begun to tackle your overflowing inboxes. But even after doing all these things and more, you might still feel overwhelmed and have a million and one things to do. Why? Having less stuff and fewer digital notifications is great, but that alone will not bring focus. And being focused is the key to success with minimalism. To find out how to move from busy to focused, we sat down for a chat with Joshua Fields Millburn of The Minimalists, an initiative to help people live more meaningful lives with less. Joshua told us how he discovered minimalism, what the difference is between focused and busy, and how to make certain the work you’re doing is meaningful. After our conversation, to say we’re inspired to make a positive change in how we approach productivity at Evernote would be an understatement. Being busy and its pitfalls Like many of us, Joshua grew up poor, experiencing all of the hardships that come with poverty. To improve his circumstances, one of the first things he did as an adult was snag a sales job and burn through 60–70 hour work weeks. All while climbing up the corporate ladder. Who could blame him? Sales jobs bring in good money, and that always makes a person appear to be successful. It didn’t take long for Joshua to become the Director of Operations of a big chain store where he was constantly promoted and given more responsibilities. He became busier and busier–so much so that being busy became a status symbol, a part of his identity. “For the longest time, I was producing volumes of supposed accomplishments, but I wasn’t productive in the creative or meaningful sense. I was ostensively getting things done, but I wasn’t REALLY getting things done,” he says. Sound familiar? “I was ostensively getting things done, but I wasn’t REALLY getting things done.” Getting and staying focused You’ve probably heard about deep work a lot. It’s the state of being fully focused and diving into what we want to create, something most of us strive for, but rarely achieve. We just don’t have the time. Over the years, Joshua has mastered deep work and while he now gets fewer things done on a daily basis, those things hold more value because he doesn’t rush through them. What’s his secret to getting focused? Getting good at saying “no”. “The problem with saying yes to everything means you’re saying no to other important things. GTD should be redefined as: Are you getting the RIGHT things done?” he stresses. Saying no and gaining power If we’re being honest with ourselves, saying “no” is not a new idea. The real secret is learning how to say “no” well and doing it consistently. That’s not an easy thing to do, but once we master it, the power of “no” will be unleashed. By saying yes to everything that’s asked of us, “We’re letting other people dictate our day and this is where busyness begins to ape the form of productivity.” Joshua offers a two step solution for saying “no” effectively: Figure out and write down what your priorities and values are, even if you’re in a hectic environment. Ask yourself some tough questions like “Who is the person I want to become? Would my 40-year-old self approve of this?” Realize and understand this: “If you say yes to something, you’re saying no to everything else. If you want to say no to something, realize that allows you to say yes to something else.” This is the true power of saying no: freeing up time so you can say yes to the things that matter most to you. “If you say yes to something, you’re saying no to everything else.” Finding common values amongst co-workers Developing these skills on your own is great, but the impact is small, especially at work. You can be extremely focused and efficient as an individual, but when the accomplishments of your entire team are measured, what matters is the group effort. When we asked Joshua how to get co-workers on board with a minimalist approach to getting things done, he offered a unique approach: create a common language and find similar values. Begin by getting people familiar with the terminology and ask yourself questions like, “what’s some new language I can introduce in the workplace? What are some benefits that this can bring to others? What are the right questions I can ask my co-workers? What is my outcome?” Joshua suggests. He adds that minimalism is about the intentional use of resources, and one of the biggest challenges to getting others on board with a new workflow is that you’re all sharing the same resources, but in different ways. You and your co-workers may have different paths and objectives, but ultimately, you can end up in the same place if you identify and pursue your similar values. Questioning the meaning of your work Most of us come into work every day either hating our jobs or wondering if the work we do is truly meaningful. If you feel this way, don’t quit your job in hopes of finding something you’re more passionate about right away. It’s easy to mistake excitement for passion, but the two are not the same. As Joshua says: “Being willing to put in the work and hours that match up with your values and getting to the other side of the mundane tasks–that’s where the real payoff is. Real passion lies on the other side of drudgery.” Joshua may have made a drastic decision of quitting his job and selling his home to pursue a minimalist life, but this isn’t the route for everyone and that’s okay. So, before we make a drastic decision, Joshua urges us to get rid of all of the excess stuff in our personal lives and professional lives and really figure out where our values lie. And while this may not be a 100% joyous process, there’s a joyous end–we’ll know whether or not our work is meaningful because we’ll be agreeing to do only meaningful work.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Anatomy of a Healthy SaaS Business", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-healthy-saas-business/", "abstract": "We recently announced that Evernote is cash flow positive and in control of our financial destiny, which is a huge milestone in the evolution of the company. Since that news broke, we have received a humbling outpouring of support from our global community, including questions about what lessons we’ve learned along the way. We’ve spent a lot of time over the past year and a half thinking about what makes a company healthy, what makes it grow, and what makes it valuable. In a nutshell, here is what makes the Evernote elephant — or any company that wants to succeed in today’s environment — run. Reviewing your org from head to toe Our best advice is to think of your organization like a living body: they both have degrees of health and both function best when all facets are in peak working condition. At Evernote, we conduct functional health check-ins throughout the company each month to ensure that everything is working together for maximum impact. These check-ups are vital for maintaining the company’s strength and overall fitness. Heart: Your core values are your company’s heart. These intrinsic beliefs, derived directly from your company’s purpose, are why you’re passionate about what you do and why you know it’s important. For us, the stories about what users were accomplishing with Evernote — from lab research to building businesses to making music — form our “why.” People go to Netflix to be entertained; they go to Facebook to connect; they come to Evernote to achieve. Why do users come to your product? Why do employees come to your organization? Answer those and everything else starts to become clear. Brain: The company’s strategy must marry technical innovation with user insight to turn your unique concept or expertise into a sustainable business. We know that knowledge workers waste 2.5 hours per day simply searching for things according to IDC research . Our insight was that there are simply too many places to search: information is scattered across email, chat, files, desktop, etc. Combined with technical advancements that make it possible to organize and find any type of document, we can make our users 25%+ more productive by acting as a repository for their ideas regardless of form. It’s not just about what your org can do; it’s about what you can do differently or better than anyone else. Lungs: The product must breathe life into the experiences that the brain conceives. We promised our users we would focus on the core of what Evernote was meant to do, then we aligned our product managers to better focus on the core experiences of Evernote: collecting, editing and searching, as well as platforms like Android and iOS. This approach will allow us to release common experiences across platforms and make the process of capture and recall even more seamless. Is your org putting the user’s experience first? Arms & Hands: Building a great product is meaningless if nobody finds it. Marketing and sales organizations must reach customers and feed the rest of the body to keep it growing. We wanted to build a personal relationship with every one of our users, even though they were in more than 200 countries around the world. To do so, we realigned our marketing and go-to-market teams, built a global community program, and created a communication mechanism in the product to guide users to the parts of Evernote most valuable to them. Stomach: That “food” — the dollars from customers who have discovered value in a product and are motivated to pay for it — goes to finance, which consumes the calories (apologies to any financial professionals insulted by this analogy; we mean it in the best way). At Evernote, we stopped eating the empty calories that come from attractive but useless vanity metrics and started thinking about the real numbers that impact our long term health. We put ourselves on a responsible diet, guided by our renewed vision and strategy, that still left room for Monday morning pastries (a real thing at Evernote HQ). Legs: When all is said and done, a SaaS business can only go as fast as its engineering team can run, so we made a series of architectural, process, and organizational changes to let us build better code faster. Learning from their success, we rolled out Agile methodologies to other teams, from marketing to legal. This allows us to align our work company-wide and put a greater focus on producing high quality product, new innovation, and improved user experiences. When you put all these pieces together, you have the most important thing: the people . We’ve added 127 new Evernoters in the last twelve months and will grow our workforce by double digits again this year, with the confidence that we’re adding the right talent to the right parts of the organization at the right time.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Thunder, Lightning, and Revisions—Mark Twain and Creativity", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/thunder-lightning-and-revisions/", "abstract": "“You need not expect to get your book right the first time. Go to work and revamp or rewrite it. God only exhibits his thunder and lightning at intervals, and so they always command attention. These are God’s adjectives.” – Mark Twain, in an 1878 letter. Samuel Langhorne Clemens was many things: a steamboat pilot, a prospector, a reporter, a world traveler, a lecturer, an investor (mostly a bad one), an inventor (with three patents; two successful, one not), a father, and, most importantly, the author known as Mark Twain. What he was not was either particularly organized or industrious. This is not to say he wasn’t prolific; he turned out novels, essays, plays, reviews, and letters by the score. He just wasn’t a slave to work. Strike While the Iron Is Hot Alex Applebaum, in a review of Bernard DeVoto’s 1942 Mark Twain at Work , noted of Twain’s working habits that Twain worked “sporadically” depending on fits of “inspiration.” Instead of forcing himself to work for a certain amount of time, [he] relied heavily on “improvisation” and would sometimes work furiously for days; sometimes not write at all; sometimes start projects and leave them hanging for years; sometimes finish them quickly … He didn’t finish nearly as much as he started, but, nevertheless, he wrote prolifically. There are still thousands of unpublished pages and ideas he never carried through with. What can we learn from this? To write and write and write some more—when inspiration strikes. Make note of everything. Don’t censor yourself. Even if an idea may seem useless now, it could well turn into something valuable later. Keep journals, diaries, notes, or even a blog. Even if an idea doesn’t lead anywhere on its own, it may provide the spark for something that does. The only mistake would be to not let your native creativity express itself when the time is right. What Works Best Is What’s Right for You While there are indeed times when we want to write or communicate your ideas with a specific goal or project in mind, don’t let not having a specific result hinder you. Twain’s approach in this regard was noted when the revised edition of his autobiography was published in 2010. Robert H. Hirst , the General Editor of the Mark Twain Project and the Curator of the Mark Twain Papers at the University of California, Berkeley, told NPR’s David Bianculli that Twain … “hit upon the right way to do an autobiography” … What he had discovered … was the art of dictation. Instead of writing down his autobiography, Twain wanted to tell stories to another human being. And instead of telling his life story in chronological order, Twain wanted to talk about what interested him at that moment—and to allow himself to change the subject as soon as his interest flagged. Twain dictated most of that autobiography from his bed. In 1905, he told A.E. Thomas of The New York Times : “Whenever I’ve got some work to do I go to bed. I got into that habit some time ago when I had an attack of bronchitis… I liked it so well that I kept it up after I got well. There are a lot of advantages about it. If you’re sitting at a desk, you get excited about what you are doing, and the first thing you know… somebody comes in to attend to the fire, he interrupts you and gets you off the trail of that idea you are pursuing.So I go to bed… Work in bed is a pretty good gospel—at least for a man who’s come, like me, to the time of life when his blood is easily frosted.” While Twain’s “working” methods may seem both antithetical to productivity and unique to him (how many of us can perform our daily tasks from a comfortable feather bed or dictate our thoughts to a handy stenographer?), there are lessons to be drawn from them. There is much to be said for allowing one’s creativity to flow freely with no inhibitions; to get something down on a page or contributed to a project. You can always develop and edit ideas, but the initial spark of creativity should never be denied. Those ideas may sit fallow for months (or even years), but they exist and you can expand upon them later when you’re ready. All Work and No Play … Perhaps Twain’s disdain for traditional working methods had to do with the fact that he didn’t consider what he did to be “work.” In the same Times interview, he told Thomas that he had never done “…a day’s work in all my life. What I have done I have done because it has been play. If it had been work I shouldn’t have done it. Who was it who said, ‘Blessed is the man who has found his work?’ Whoever it was he had the right idea in his mind…When we talk about the great workers of the world, we really mean the great players of the world. The fellows who groan and sweat under the weary load of toil that they bear never can hope to do anything great.” He expounded on this point in his 1889 novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court (that savagely ridiculed capitalism and the looming “Golden Age” of plutocrats) by having his surrogate protagonist say: “Intellectual “work” is misnamed; it is a pleasure, a dissipation and its own highest reward. The poorest paid architect, engineer, general, author, sculptor, painter, lecturer, advocate, legislator, actor, preacher, singer, is constructively in heaven when he is at work; and as for the magician with the fiddle-bow in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him—why certainly, he is at work, if you wish to call it that, but lord, it’s a sarcasm just the same. The law of work does seem utterly unfair—but there it is, and nothing can change it: the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it, the higher shall be his pay in cash, also.” Today, so many of us get caught up in our day jobs (that can, admittedly, be drudgery) that we don’t allow ourselves to take the time to think, reflect, and enjoy the freedom of expressing ourselves and preserving our own observations and ideas. The thought of actually sitting at a keyboard—or, worse, actually putting pen to paper!—can seem like schoolwork or a chore. But how often do we get the chance to be with ourselves and commit what we really think and feel in a permanent form? Sure, coming up with a pithy tweet or a vague Facebook status is nice, but how much better to give ourselves the freedom to really dig into and examine an idea or a concept to ourselves? It’s not like anyone else has to see it or read it; the mere chance to think and write about an idea develop creative muscles that can be useful when they’re really needed for something to be expressed publically. There’s No Such Thing as an Original Idea To duplicate and use Twain’s methods would honor the man who expressed the notion that there were no original ideas; just borrowings and expansions of the work and ideas of others. In 1892, author and humanitarian Helen Keller was accused (and acquitted) of plagiarism. After reading about the case in Keller’s own autobiography, Twain was moved to write her, saying: “Oh, dear me, how unspeakably funny and owlishly idiotic and grotesque was that “plagiarism” farce! As if there was much of anything in any human utterance, oral or written, except plagiarism! The kernel, the soul—let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterances—is plagiarism. … It takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or a telephone or any other important thing—and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others. With this in mind, it almost behooves us to expose ourselves to as much knowledge and inspiration we can find from any source in order to synthesize it and, ironically, make it our own. Read anything you can. Write down notes and observations.” (The edited versions of Twain’s own notebooks and journals of just his first 36 years as a writer run to more than 2,200 pages.) Let inspiration take you to the familiar and imaginary. Travel. People-watch. Get out of your comfort zone and see things and meet people that are “strange” and unfamiliar in order to make them familiar and then share those unique insights with others. Make yourself the most interesting person in the room because you’ve been there and done that—and can express it in colorful and exciting terms. (Though two more precepts from Twain should be noted here: “As to the adjective: when in doubt, strike it out.” and “Use plain, simple language, short words, and brief sentences. That is the way to write English—it is the modern way and the best way. Stick to it; don’t let fluff and flowers and verbosity creep in.” What good are even the best observations if they get lost in the underbrush?) In his notebook for 1902-1903, Twain may have given his most trenchant tip: “The time to begin writing an article is when you have finished it to your satisfaction. By that time, you begin to clearly and logically perceive what it is that you really want to say.” So, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need to now to start over again the beginning …", "date": "2017-02-17,"},

The prediction of a ‘paperless era’ has compelled purveyors of paper products, like Oxford , to evolve their core mission. Headquartered in France, Oxford sells over sixty million notebooks and daily planners each year to students and professionals across Europe. In the United States, praises abound from paper enthusiasts for Oxford’s Black n’ Red notebooks . The question is this: What does the future hold for paper products in a digital note-taking world? In 2016, Oxford set out to find some answers. They partnered with the IFOP (French Institute of Public Opinion, in English) to explore the role handwriting plays in the lives of young people (ages 12-25) in France today . Of the 1,004 people surveyed, 75% confirmed their perception that handwritten notes are still valuable. Typing notes into a computer may work well in more passive, lecture settings. When it comes to shaping ideas, mind-mapping, project planning, and collaboration, however, people still prefer paper. With this in mind, Oxford developed a vision to find a smarter way for paper and digital notes to work together. Smartphone apps breathe new life into handwritten notes Since its inception in 1910, Oxford has kept ‘innovation’ high on its list of core values . A few years ago, motivated by a relentless desire to keep innovating, Oxford developed five smartphone apps to scan handwritten notes, one app for each compatible notebook. A little over a month ago, Oxford launched a new app called SCRIBZEE. Unlike its predecessors, SCRIBZEE captures handwritten notes from any specially marked, Oxford-branded product. Notes are saved to the cloud and can be accessed from multiple devices. Oxford looks to Evernote to amplify their paper products It’s become clear that, at its core, Oxford was still in the business of manufacturing of paper products and wanted to look to others in the digital note-taking world to help extend the life of their products. Because they saw Evernote as a leader in the digital note-taking space, Oxford decided to build an integration between their newest scanning app, SCRIBZEE, and Evernote. “Even though what people store in Evernote is digitized, much of the content comes from the physical world and, in many ways, is ‘human-centric’.” – Eric Joan, CEO of the Hamelin Group When asked why Oxford chose Evernote, Eric Joan, the CEO of Hamelin, Oxford’s parent company, replied, “Evernote is a company of ‘human-size’ that shares many of the values a family-owned business, like Oxford, shares.” In Eric’s mind, Oxford as a manufacturer of physical products people are attached to, but need to integrate with their digital worlds. Evernote, on the other hand, already lives in the digital world where people are store content from their physical world of photos, forms, and business cards. “Even though what people store in Evernote is in a digital form,” Eric adds, “much of the content comes from the physical world and, in many ways, stays ‘human-centric’.” Download SCRIBZEE from the Evernote App Center » Android | iPhone For more about SCRIBZEE, visit Oxford’s SCRIBZEE blog » We’d love to know if there are any Oxford Notebook fans in our Evernote community?

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Thinking Small: How Habits Hold the Key to Staying Productive", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-habits-are-the-key-to-staying-productive/", "abstract": "If you’re like most people, you picked a few New Year’s resolutions last December. You had every intention of following through with bids to be better in your personal and professional life. Now that we’re in the third month of 2017, the harsh reality is that by now, a sizable chunk of the populace has left these typical resolutions by the roadside. According to a research report from the University of Minnesota , 80 percent of us who set out on a journey of change and self-renewal ditched them by Valentine’s Day. Psychology of change So, why do we bail on our resolutions before we see them through? “The problem is that we put such a heavy, ‘pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps’ burden on ourselves with New Year’s resolutions,” says Jelena Obradovic , an assistant professor at Stanford University whose research focuses on psychological development. “To really change, and to have it persist, sometimes those barriers have to change as well,” she explains. Most of the time, external obstacles provide the biggest barrier to our goals. Maybe costs are prohibitive to joining a workout program, or the pressure of work and its demands weigh heavily on our free time. Sometimes, in order for us to change, we need to recognize the barriers that make that difficult. If you made it into the month of February, you’re part of an elite group — more than 40 percent of Americans abandon their resolutions a few weeks into the year. But, if you didn’t, there’s still good news. Those who successfully hold and eventually accomplish their resolutions usually do so after they’ve failed five or six times. It takes time and multiple efforts. While the New Year’s resolution is primarily a western concept, the annual refresh and recalibration is a wholly celebratory mindset that happens around the globe in February, March, and even the summer. So, how about a restart? You don’t need arbitrary timeframes like the symbolic page-turn of a calendar to challenge yourself to experience rapid and rewarding change. You can pick up where you left off the last time you tried, and start implementing things that are meaningful in your life today. If you’ve abandoned your resolutions (or if you’re still working on them), here are some simple tactics you can implement that will get you back on track and help to keep you there well into the year. Hard habits to break When January rolls around and we choose to exercise more, drink less, and unplug from social media, it’s helpful to remember that these things have become habits—automatic behaviors that dictate certain parts of our day. There’s a reason why you want to pick up that large caffeinated beverage each morning or turn on the television after a long day at work. They’re conditioned responses. To break old habits, the best approach is to build new ones. It’s all a matter of science . Here’s how you can change your old ways. Start small. Habit-forming should be incremental. Our resolutions fail sometimes because they often are audacious goals. Those big goals quickly turn into impossible dreams. If you want to work out more, then hack your daily routine so it fits smaller actions that represent your resolution: Walk to work or take the stairs instead of an elevator. If you want to increase the number of books you tackle this year, read during a break at work, or before bed. Looking to unplug and live more in the real world? Stop sending emails once you get off work and focus on yourself or family instead. Attach actions. Choose an existing positive habit in your life and tack on a new action to it. If you’re already reading each day, but want to increase it, challenge yourself to read one or two chapters each day. If you write, challenge yourself to hammer out a high-quality passage or an entire chapter in a set amount of time. If you’re running a half mile, try to ramp it up to three-quarters of a mile, or tack on ten additional minutes to your training routine. By doing this, you’re adding positive cues that help form a stimulus to your habit. Implement the new action. To start feeling comfortable with your new habit, practice it for at least a week. For a habit to really stick, you’ll need to build up a conditioned response to the new action at least three to seven times the first week. Whatever your action, don’t over complicate it. The simpler the action, the easier it is to fit into your daily routine. For example: Create a note about writing each day and pin it to your daily to-do list in Evernote. Print a note that reminds you to “walk an extra ten minutes” and pin it somewhere visible—like your refrigerator, computer monitor, or steering wheel. Add an Evernote reminder to put a healthy ingredient into your smoothie each morning. Aim for long-term by thinking small One of the biggest factors for staying engaged with your resolutions for the long-term involves thinking small. The most successful people are able to set and focus on creating or changing long-term habits, rather than being dictated by bursts of activity followed by eventual burnout. Few things exemplify the power of the small task like that of Kaizen – a Japanese business philosophy concerning the continuous improvement of working practices and personal efficiency. Author Robert Maurer is an expert on kaizen and wrote the book , One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way, all about how the process uses small, simple, and consistent steps to create lasting change and meaningful impact. Maurer’s take on Kaizen as a problem-solving methodology is rooted in the 2,000-year-old wisdom of Tao Te Ching—“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” For the purpose of maintaining resolution goals, implement this methodology by using the Kaizen way to remove the barriers that block you. It’s incredibly difficult for even the most inspired person to immediately to cut a habit out. Instead, focus on meaningful and positive change by eliminating the roadblocks that discourage us from accomplishing goals. In the fervor surrounding New Year’s resolutions, we may sign up for a new gym membership, believing that all the treadmills and classes will help us achieve our goal. But, it isn’t long before we realize that life gets in the way—before long, meetings, work, and the demands of our personal lives get in the way. The Kaizen method suggests choosing a very doable, small thing. Instead of making a huge commitment to a gym, and signing up for (and then missing) a bunch of classes, you could strive to walk to work each morning or take a daily twenty-minute walk during a lunch break. Robert Maurer suggests explicitly choosing a single thing and sticking to it for at least thirty days: “ Radical change is like charging up a steep hill – you may run out of wind before you reach the crest, or the thought of all the work ahead makes you give up no sooner than you’ve begun. There is an alternative…. And all it requires is that you place one foot in front of the other,” Maurer says. Whether you’ve started your New Year’s resolutions with a renewed vigor, or if you’re still plugging along, we hope that some of these small-minded (in the best way possible) tactics help get you there.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "On Minimalism: Simple Living and the Road to Happiness", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/simple-living-and-the-road-to-happiness/", "abstract": "At Evernote, we love productivity, but we also care about maintaining balance in our lives. This month, we’re diving into how experts on minimalism stay productive without losing focus on what’s important. In part two of this series, we learned that there’s an inherent difference between being focused and being busy. In this post, we’ll explore how consumerism connects to depression and the counterpart, how minimalism connects to happiness–a state of frequent positive emotions and a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in life . Typical American homes are now double the size they were 1950s , we drive fancier cars, and fill our closets to the brim with unworn clothes. Many have even accumulated credit card debt from buying all these things. We’ve been buying more stuff than ever because it brings us instant gratification. And yet, we’re not any happier in the long run. In fact, studies show that consumerism has made us less happy and more miserable . We recently chatted with Joshua Becker, the man behind Becoming Minimalist , an inspiring blog read by millions of people. As a husband and a father of two,  Joshua and his family live a typical, middle-class lifestyle, minus all of the consumerism. He spends his time helping people uncover the joys, struggles, and lessons you’re bound to experience during your minimalism journey–offering his readers a rational approach to minimalism, one of the many roads to happiness. Inspiration to live simpler We asked Joshua what inspired him to become a minimalist and we were touched and filled with guilt by his story. “Every time I received a pay increase, I bought more stuff. One day, I was cleaning out my garage and my son was begging me to play with him, but I was too busy. And here’s where I thought to myself, why am I taking all this time caring for physical things that don’t mean anything to me, and meanwhile, the very thing that means the most to me, is pushed to the back burner?” he told us. How many of us have experienced something similar? We’ve probably all been in a situation where our possessions were actually taking time away from what brings us happiness. “Meanwhile, the very thing that means the most to me is pushed to the back burner.”—Joshua Becker If this resonates with you, you’re not alone. It’s not too late to begin simplifying your life, even if you think you’re too knee-deep into consumerism, or perhaps too old. “Oh, no. It’s never too late. I actually think it’s more important for older people who have accumulated a lot of stuff than it is for someone who is younger, who doesn’t have a lot of stuff and has more freedom to easily decide to become and stay minimalist,” Joshua stresses. For the older folks with families who have accumulated a bunch of possessions over the years, there’s a huge opportunity to regain the freedom that you’ve sacrificed with every purchase over the years. Minimalism and happiness But, how exactly can minimalism make us happier? “Minimalism in of itself doesn’t make you happier. It’s a means to an end. What it does is frees up our most finite resources. It frees up time, money, energy, and removes stress. It frees up all of these resources that you can now start investing in what brings you purpose. The pursuit of happiness is empty. We find happiness when we find purpose, a life of fulfillment, and our greatest passion,” Joshua explains. “Minimalism frees up our most finite resources.” —Joshua Becker Steps to less stuff, and more freedom If all of the material in your life isn’t making you happy, if you have a hard time getting things done at work, and if you ever feel like you don’t have time for anything you love, minimalism might just be the solution for you. There are many steps you can take to live a minimalist life, but let’s start with the basics: Understand the meaning of minimalism , what benefits it can bring to your life, and that it’s not always going to be a simple and easy journey. Begin to declutter your life, step by step. Start with your home , and then move on to your office . And don’t forget to minimize your digital clutter ! Learn the difference between being focused and busy at work and begin implementing deep work into your daily routine. Do less and live more . Work your way towards a life with fewer distractions and of being in the moment . So, how about it, are you ready to pursue a happier life?

Every March, people from all over the world flock to the tech hub of the American south to rub shoulders with celebrities, share ideas, and simply celebrate life in the 21st Century. There’s so much to take in, SXSW lasts more than a week. While a trip to the event may be an unforgettable experience, remembering everything you learned throughout the week, it’s nearly impossible. That’s where Evernote came in. This year, Evernote served as the official note-takers of the Workplace Track at SXSW. From March 10-13, five professional note-takers attended more than thirty sessions. We wanted to capture not only the spirit of SXSW, but the genius of the speakers. Evernoters Bijan, Ariel, Amanda, Cipriano, and Dorothy worked tirelessly throughout the weekend, sending notes from Austin to the writing team in California. Those five editors polished the final notes and published them in an Evernote public link. The result is a collection of modern thought and insights into the current state and future of how we work. Join the SXSW Workplace Track notebook » Spread the Words “Spread the words,” we encouraged attendees. “Bring the ideas from SXSW to your companies, your jobs, and do your part to be the change coming to the global workplace.” We’d like to give you sneak peek of Evernote editors’ favorite snippets from the session notes—a tasting menu of some of the great content you’ll find in the notes.  Be sure to join the notebook , read the notes, and spread the words! Quotes about Women’s Issues: Session | Short Changed: Why Women’s Salaries Fall Short Stacey Redman: I want to say, “push back on this.” …If women do push back, they apologize. Men don’t apologize for asking. Session | Elephant on Madison Avenue Bradley Jakeman: I’m leaning into and advocating for these issues from a business perspective. 85% of purchases in most industries are made by women. So, why is 90% of the marketing for them done by men? Lisen Stromberg: We hire men for potential and we hire women for what they’ve accomplished. “Barbara Hillary was the first African-American woman to reach both North and South poles at ages 75 and 79, respectively, after beating both lung and breast cancer. She has only two sentences on her Wikipedia page.” Quotes about Technology: Session | Augmented Intelligence: The Next-Gen AI Melanie Cook: “The most important question isn’t how to make super intelligence, or when will it come about. The most important question is, when it does come about, how do we make it do the right thing?” Session | Get Out, Be In: What I’ve Learned Working Remotely David Weaver: “Technology is great, but it can be overwhelming and counterproductive. Take a moment and ask yourself ‘why and I using this technology?’ More often than not, you can remove that app, or software from your life and find a handful of things to meet your needs.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How The Montessori Method Applies to Today’s Workplace", "author": ["Barbara Atkinson"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/the-montessori-method-in-todays-workplace/", "abstract": "“Imagination does not become great until human beings, given the courage and the strength, use it to create.” – Maria Montessori Maria Montessori’s legacy reshaped the field of education, introducing the philosophy that we learn and grow best by following an innate path of self-development. She knew what she was talking about—she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize an astounding six times, and her image was even on Italy’s 1,000 Lire banknote. She urged her students—both children and adults—to “trust that you know what you’re doing.” It worked in classrooms when we were children, and it works in the workplace today. An educational rebel In the late nineteenth century in Italy, when Maria Montessori was born, girls had only two career choices: to be either a teacher or a nun. But that didn’t stop Maria. She was an excellent student, passionate about her education, and ambitious. Her parents certainly didn’t hamper their daughter’s natural enthusiasm for learning. They were both avid readers and well-educated themselves. They also had the means to support their daughter in doing something that bordered on scandalous. Montessori entered an all-boys technical school at 13 to study engineering (where she was required to spend recess inside to avoid being tormented by her male peers). After graduating high school, she decided her next step was another male-dominated field—medicine. Hey, the girl liked a challenge. Montessori applied to, and was rejected by, the University of Rome’s medical program, ostensibly due to her lack of knowledge of classical languages. Undaunted, she studied for  two more years, then reapplied. The university finally had to admit her. Still, it was considered too risqué for her to work on cadavers in mixed company, so she did so in the evenings, alone. Boundaries be damned. Maria Montessori graduated in 1896, the first woman in Italy with a medical degree. Forging her own path Montessori’s early medical practice focused on psychiatry, which was still in its infancy (Freud’s The Interpretation of Dreams , for example, was published in 1899, and took eight years to sell all 600 copies). She also attended courses on education, where she developed a deep interest in educational theory, especially in the ways children with intellectual and developmental disabilities were treated. In 1900, she launched a new training institute for special education teachers. This gave her a place to experiment with different teaching methods. In 1907, she opened the Casa dei Bambini, a childcare center for unsupervised poor children. There, she designed the classroom environment and the learning materials to foster what she believed was each child’s natural desire to learn. International influence Montessori’s approach to education was enthusiastically adopted internationally and in her native Italy. When Benito Mussolini seized power in 1922, Montessori, who had been traveling and lecturing aboard, returned to Italy to accept the position he offered her, that of “Chief Educator.” Blending politics and education didn’t work out so well for Montessori, however. She fled the country in 1934, after refusing Mussolini’s dictate that her schools pledge their allegiance to fascism. Mussolini retaliated by shutting more than 70 Italian Montessori schools . Meanwhile, Montessori headed to India, where she spent time with Gandhi, who was a huge proponent of the Montessori system ; he taught the children in his ashrams using a similar technique. Her friendship with Gandhi and her continued focus on pacifism influenced Montessori’s books Education for Peace and Education for a New World . Learning in its natural state Montessori founded her method on the observation that children who are placed in a rich, unstructured environment learned naturally. An educator could simply provide opportunities for the natural stages of learning to flourish. Her schoolrooms were equipped with child-sized furniture (radical for the time). She trained teachers to give children the freedom to play however they liked with “spontaneous discipline.” It was so successful that by 1910, the Montessori Method was known worldwide. Today, there are 22,000 Montessori schools in at least 110 countries. Interact and learn: The Montessori Method Another educational innovation Montessori introduced was based on the then-new concept that we learn by interacting directly with our environment. She also concluded that children learn things, then build upon what they learn, moving to the next step naturally, without the need for a forced, inflexible lesson plan. All of Montessori’s theories can be great for grown-ups, too. How many of us get stuck in the way we’ve always done something, rather than reacting to what’s actually happening? Instead of imposing a one-size-fits-all solution or way of thinking, trust yourself to develop your own path. Freedom and challenge: Not just for kids If you’re hitting too much resistance, you may not be using the right tools, or maybe you’re working toward the wrong goal. Even as adults, we “fall behind” when we try to force something too early. Meeting an arbitrary norm isn’t a good reason to set a goal. For example, there’s no rule that says you should have a good grasp of a foreign language after two years’ study, or that you should have mastered a software program after a month of using it. Someone just made that up, and it doesn’t take individual circumstances into consideration. The Montessori Method trusts that kids will guide themselves to an appropriate stage of learning. It works for adults, too. Individual paths: forge ahead For self-guided learning to work, the Montessori educational model relies on a methodical progression from one level to the next. Students tackle lessons in the way that works best for them. First, discover the best learning style for you. Once you get that, you can turn up the gas. Montessori believed in “sensitive periods,” a developmental stage in which a student has the most to gain from a new experience. When in a s ensitive period, a child shows an intense interest in a certain activity or type of play until a new skill has been mastered. Adults do it, too, becoming enamored of certain hobbies or interests . The key is trusting that your interests have value. Pay close attention to your enthusiasm – what is it guiding you toward? That’s where you’ll shine. Montessori believed that all students  to develop strong “self-regulation,” the ability to educate yourself, know what is being learned, and assess the learning experiences. Where is your work style weak? Where are you strong? Determining each aren’t value judgments, they’re information tools to help you get to where you want to go. Goals and structure: We still need ‘em Montessori insisted on uninterrupted blocks of work time. Without interruptions to disrupt that groove, you’ll have the mental space to make crucial connections and let those discoveries sink in. Block out uninterrupted work, play or creativity time just for you. It’s crucial for creative thinking and innovation. Mentorship and Community: Connect Montessori also relied on the community created by mixed age groups. Younger kids look up to older ones as supportive, helpful figures. Older kids enjoy playing the role of mentor. For adults, many of our best mentors may not be rock star success stories, but rather  people who are just a few steps further along the same path. A mentor can either be someone who’s been where you are now, or who has already arrived where you want to be. Ask them for advice or just try some of their approaches. Applying the Lessons: Get out there Montessori recognized that for children, their play is their work, especially activities which appear creative, abstract, and fun. Take that concept and run with it: It’s all good. Embrace things that don’t have a clear path to profit or external growth. Time spent doing something creative and (un)constructive is still totally worthwhile. “Respect your process,” “Find your groove,” and “Work hard, play hard.”  These are not just tee-shirt mottos, they’re proven educational approaches.  Take it from Dr. Montessori: You can get where you need to go by respecting your own way of doing things. Wander from someone else’s game plan. Grab some quiet time. Play to your strengths, and yes, play as hard as you work.", "date": "2017-03-14,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "“Nothing Surprises Me Anymore”— Evernote’s Director of Engineering on Gender Equality and Mentoring", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/kathryn-koehler-on-gender-equality/", "abstract": "The struggles of women in technical fields, particularly in Silicon Valley, has made headlines this month. It has never been a secret that women who go into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) careers face an uphill battle for equality and respect. Some find it difficult to be taken seriously enough to be considered for the job in the first place. Silicon Valley, in particular, has been called out as a place where women have had difficulty finding career equality, all while bemoaning a shortage of enough technically-trained professionals to meet the hiring demand. We, too, happen to be a Silicon Valley tech company, so in recognition of Women’s History Month, we sat down with three of Evernote’s technical managers, Kathryn Koehler, Chantal Leonard, and Kara Hodecker. Each of these three women holds a highly visible leadership role within the company, and each has a lot to say about the state of women in tech, what it took to get where they are, and how they manage their lives and jobs. First up is Kathryn Koehler, Evernote’s Director of Engineering, Applications. “Nothing surprises me anymore” Kathryn has to stop and think how many people report to her. At the moment, she says, it’s 18 direct reports, but 40 in total, distributed across web, mobile, and desktop applications as well as a few component teams. Kathryn says she doesn’t think of herself as a “woman in tech.” After 22 years, she says, “I’m here to fix things. I feel like I have a seat at the table.” Her role was hard-earned. Originally, Kathryn wanted to be a race-car driver, and she majored in mechanical engineering with an emphasis in Automotive. “I had an internship at an auto manufacturer in Michigan,” Kathryn recalls. “They just made me fetch coffee and make copies.” Out of college, she went to Snap-On Tools as a staff engineer. “One day, someone asked if anyone had any programming experience—and my career as a programmer was born.” Focusing on relationships—with some tough conversations After two and a half years, Kathryn left the automotive industry for tech. “Tech is faster, it uses the same part of your brain as Automotive, and you’re not going to kill anybody if you screw up,” she says. She was one of the few female Windows developers in the world at that time. “There’s a stereotype that says you have to be a dude of a certain age to write for the Windows platform, and I don’t fit that mold.” Nevertheless, in eight years she worked her way up to becoming a lead software engineer. But it wasn’t easy. “I’ve been told, ‘you don’t strike me as the kind of woman who would have a computer at home,’” she relates. “Nothing surprises me anymore. I’m horrified by what I’ve experienced, what I’ve seen other women experience, but not surprised. I’ve just found places to work that are respectful to women.” Kathryn’s management style also counters the stereotype, which she considers to be the secret to her success. “I focus on personal relationships, facilitating conversations,” she says. “I get very protective and ‘Mama Bear’ about the people who work for me. Caring about people’s lives is stuff that can get missed in other types of engineering organizations. But I call them out on their B.S.,” she adds. “ I give immediate feedback in a way they can digest.” “I’m not an angry female, I’m a strong female.”—Kathryn Koehler “When will we have gender parity?” Kathryn thinks hard about her answer. “When people stop expecting us to act like men to succeed. When we’re treated with equal regard. I’m loud. I don’t let people interrupt me. I’m not an angry female; I’m a strong female. I’m an engineer first, and a woman second. But I’m a huge advocate for women to support each other, and not stepping on each other’s backs to get ahead. That stereotype drives me crazy.” “I don’t sit around and think, ‘I’m a trailblazer’” Adamant that young women today should not have to expect to endure sexism on the job, Kathryn is a vocal advocate for education across genders. “It’s not our job to train men not to act inappropriately,” she said. “It’s our job to call them out on it. I try to lead by example.” But women, she has always told her employees, need to stand up for themselves, too. “I say to them, ‘you’re doing all the right things. You can stay and fight, or you can go somewhere else. But what you don’t have to do is take it.’ I don’t let those things define me. I don’t sit around and think ‘I’m a trailblazer.’” Kathryn is saddened by the fact that so many talented women choose to leave the workforce rather than fight for the flexibility that they need to balance career and children. “These antiquated ideas are causing half of a generation of intelligence and creativity to go missing from the job market. They don’t want to fight that uphill battle. But companies aren’t going to be able to survive without the talent they need. Lack of workplace flexibility isn’t good for anyone.” Breaking stereotypes through mentoring Recently, Kathryn became a mentor with the Ascent program with Everwise , a 6-month learning experience designed to help women advance their careers. There, she’s paired with other women who see themselves rising to similar roles in technology. Kathryn had no formal mentor of her own and had to pick and choose traits from many different people. The idea of women helping women is, in itself, a stereotype-breaker. “In an earlier position, I had a female peer who was also at the director level,” Kathryn recalled.  “People expected us to hate each other just because we were both women. Nothing could have been further from the truth. We helped each other and supported each other to the ends of the earth.” Last year, Kathryn mentored four women in the Computer Science department at Stanford University and maintains ongoing mentorships from her last job, and some from Everwise. Evernote has seven women leaders in the Everwise program who are being mentored, but Kathryn, after more than two decades as an engineer, serves as a mentor to others. “Mentoring offers people unconditional support,” she declared. “I meet with them, or I do it over the phone, but I like the face-to-face experience. We talk about the issues they’re facing, how they think they’re going to solve it, and I offer advice, encouragement, and hope. We are right on the brink of a generational transformation.” Kathryn’s story serves as a prime example. “I wanted to be a race car driver. I can fix a car, I have a husband and children, and I’ve had a successful career as an engineering director. Showing people—both men and women—that it’s possible to have a healthy, balanced life helps them make the choices for themselves.” These choices, about the lifestyle employees want, and about enlightened company policies, are going to reshape the workplace throughout this century.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Kara Hodecker, Product Design Manager: “We have to stand up for each other”", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/we-have-to-stand-up-for-each-other/", "abstract": "This is the second of a three-part series featuring women technical leaders at Evernote. In our first article, we featured engineering director, Kathryn Koehler . Kara Hodecker is stoked. With a recent promotion, she’s become one of three women in leadership roles on the technical side of the house at Evernote. “I oversee the design across desktop, mobile, and web, and I understand what we’re shipping on the different platforms. We’re working to achieve even better consistency across each one,” Kara said. She’s energetic, and her enthusiasm for what she does fills a room. “We need to make sure everyone knows where the features are no matter how they’re using the product. Though these features might not look the same across platforms, they’re still there. We help customers by making sure the words and the visual indications are consistent, so they can find all the features they know, no matter what iteration of Evernote they’re using.” Emerging technologies present opportunities for women Kara’s road to her current role began at the Rochester Institute of Technology, where she studied New Media Design. “It was a graphic and web design hybrid with some programming. That education set me up well for a lot of different potential careers. I learned a lot of different skills there, and I went into web design after school. I worked for digital agencies to do typical web work,” she said. Kara went to Yahoo in 2011, and it was there she got her first product design experience with an app called Livestand, an iPad-only customized news app. Though creating a look and feel for a product requires a sharp aesthetic eye, Kara doesn’t consider herself an artist. “I like the word creative,” she demurs. “I’m good at visualizing and having a sense of color or typography, or what makes something well designed. I wouldn’t call myself an artist.” Although some women have had to fight to make it in tech, Kara feels that the design field has been friendly toward women. Her impression is that since product design is a newer discipline, gender stereotypes aren’t as entrenched. Evernote’s product design staff is balanced, the skill sets for product design are broad, and Kara says she looks for varied backgrounds when hiring new designers. “A lot of people are self-taught,” Kara explained. “Some people went to school for biology or psychology, and people can apply those skill sets to design.” A short stint in a “bro” culture Kara’s positive energy wavers a bit when she relates memories of trying to make her way as one of the only women at a previous company. “I’ve had to present in a roomful of men,” she recalled. “I was talking, and they were on their phones or having a side conversation. They didn’t do that with the guys. They just didn’t pay attention to me. It was really hard. I’d try to get them back on track, but they’d come back at me with ‘aw, we’re just joking.’ It was a big reason why I ended up leaving that company.” Still, Kara remains cautious. “It’s important to stand up for yourself, but the truth is, what will it ultimately cost your career to do it? That’s a hard question, but not everyone is in a position to take that kind of risk. Some people can’t just leave a job because they have to care for family. So we have to stand up for each other.” Solving problems together through mentorship One of the ways women are finding their voices in technology is through formal mentoring. Today, with Evernote, Kara is part of a program through Ascent Everwise (no relation to Evernote) that provides such mentoring to professional women. “The program is cool,” Kara said. “They’ve brought together 50-60 women who are all in trajectory for leadership, and paired us with women who are in powerful positions in various companies in the Bay Area.” The Ascent program is the first time Kara has been formally mentored.  “While I was coming up, I didn’t really think about being mentored,” she said. “I just looked up to certain people and thought ‘I want to be her,’ or ‘I want to be as good as she is.’ So I tried to learn as much as I could from them. A lot of time people didn’t know they were mentoring me.” Navigating the work/life balance conundrum Kara categorizes herself as “really ambitious” and often thinks about having a bigger impact on a business team, corporate culture, and how to make a fun place to work. She has an idea of someday becoming a vice president of design. But since having a daughter a year and a half ago, she’s had to make some tough choices about work/life balance. “I’m grateful for flexible hours here,” she said. “My priorities have shifted. Now, I have to turn ‘work mode’ on. I want to leave between 4:00 and 5:00, spend time with my daughter, and then turn on work mode and work in the evening. I have to be able to focus, and I do that better at home.” Kara’s positive attitude help her keep the breakneck pace going. As she moves up the corporate ladder, she faces difficult decisions and greater challenges. But she’s confident that with the help of mentoring and increased awareness about the special challenges women face in the workplace, things are looking up for women in technology. Next: Meet Chantal Leonard, Director of Product Management", "date": "2017-03-31,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Chantal Leonard: “There was no undercurrent to conform to gender norms”", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/there-was-no-undercurrent-to-conform-to-gender-norms/", "abstract": "This is the final installment of a three-part series featuring women technical leaders at Evernote. In our first article, we featured engineering director, Kathryn Koehler , and in our second, product design manager Kara Hodecker . Chantal Leonard (far left in the photo above) is a little surprised by her rapid rise in the high-tech world. Many have read stories of young people coming to Silicon Valley and becoming company leaders at start-ups right away. Although these stories make it seem as though this happens all the time, rising to a position of leadership quickly at an established company is rather rare. When Chantal joined Evernote last year as the Director of Product Management, it was only her second job out of college. As a woman in technology, in particular, it is remarkable to climb to these heights quickly. But Chantal, who has a degree in computer science from the University of Waterloo in Canada, defied the odds. Help comes from the extended network Her university offered a CS program that focused heavily on internships, and as a result, Chantal had the opportunity to try out several of the career options a CS major afforded her. These internships also expanded her network. Having a large and versatile group of connections made it easier for Chantal to get employment opportunities early in her career. The combination of the right people, the right ideas, and the right advice also helped her to focus on what she wanted to do. “In one of my internships, I was responsible for driving the beta program for a speech-based application for the telecom industry,” Chantal remembered. “After I completed the internship, I got feedback from my manager that while I was a good programmer, I was a natural at understanding customer pain points and translating that into what we could improve in the product. He encouraged me to follow more work like that. It was a revelation to me,” she said. “I had no idea. But that advice resonated with me. ” Armed with this new perspective, she followed the advice of a friend who told her about a program manager position available at Microsoft. “She connected me with one of the recruiters that she had worked with in the past, and on the strength of her recommendation, I got the interview.” Microsoft flew her to Seattle, but Chantal’s extended network wasn’t finished helping her. Her friend introduced her to someone who already had the title Chantal was targeting. “He spent a couple of hours with me the day before the interview, helping me prep. He gave me advice about how to approach the questions, and more.” After a full day of interviews, she landed the job, straight out of college. The strength of a supportive family Landing a plum role at a major tech company took more than talent and a network. A family that cherished education and individuality contributed heavily to Chantal’s success. “My parents always encouraged my interests, whether in sports or academics,” she said. “I was a strong student in math, so it was a natural extension to go for Computer Science. But I wasn’t sure. I thought long and hard about going down a business or commerce path instead. I knew that CS can be a tough road for women.” It was a discussion with her father that changed her mind. “That was an interesting conversation,” Chantal laughed. “He convinced me that getting a technology degree had some merits, and if I wanted, I could explore business through an MBA later.” Since both her parents hold MBAs, his advice made a lot of sense to her. “In my family, there was no undercurrent for conforming to gender norms.” A positive mindset can cause changes in the workplace Chantal is aware of the challenges her peers face and feels fortunate in her experience as a woman in tech. However, while she sympathizes with women who are still enduring difficulties working in an atmosphere of prejudice, she has not felt it herself. “I met a few people at university who asked me why I was majoring in computer science, and there was some expectation that I wouldn’t see the degree through,” she said. “But that just made me even more convinced to finish, even though the first couple of years were tough.” Later, when Chantal started working full time, she found herself in a unusual position: all of her managers were female. “It didn’t seem like I was doing anything out of the ordinary,” she related. “Working in tech seemed so much more approachable because I had great examples. In all my cases, I had senior women around me that made picturing myself in a management position more viable. That’s a different experience from what I see for other women in the tech industry.” Success came easier after finding her niche Today, Chantal knows exactly what she wants to do for the rest of her life. She’s found a home working on technology for consumers. “That’s where I thrive,” Chantal said. “I’ve developed my craft as a product manager, and I think I have some skills that make me effective, including things like attention to detail and building user-oriented solutions. I also think that being given the chance to grow and develop into a senior individual contributor for the first five years of my career was helpful.” Thanks to her well-developed network and extensive work experience, Chantal also became a strong proponent of mentoring. She is currently being mentored as part of the Everwise program (though we have similar names, Everwise is not affiliated with Evernote), but she’s no stranger to the concept. She also serves as a mentor for other women. Mentorship connections continue to have a lasting impact on her career – in fact, Chantal came to Evernote through one of her mentees who joined the company a few years ago. Now, as she approaches her one-year anniversary with Evernote, Chantal credits her previous mentors and managers for helping her reach the role of director just eight years out of college. “I didn’t know where I wanted to go with my career,” Chantal said. “But I was lucky enough to have managers who asked me questions that led me down the right path. In the first years of my career, I couldn’t tell you what the next year would look like. Fortunately, my managers always made me think about it.” Chantal’s expression turned thoughtful. “Knowing the answers is helpful, but it’s okay not to know everything right away if you can go back and discuss what you need to learn with a trusted mentor.”", "date": "2017-04-5,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Most and Least Productive Hours in a Day", "author": ["Barbara Atkinson"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/the-most-and-least-productive-hours-in-a-day/", "abstract": "In a perfect world (or, at least a more efficient one), you could be productive whenever you wanted. Just sit down and start typing/put that pen to paper/invent the next app or Fidget Spinner. Unfortunately, productivity isn’t as easy as just plugging in for humans—we experience energy and creativity peaks and valleys. Those valleys are necessary—they’re your brain and body telling you that you need a break. While you can’t (and shouldn’t) eliminate the normal, less productive times in your day, there is a way to recognize when you’re most likely to be at your performance best, and optimize it. While your productivity goals will always benefit from smart time management strategies, they’ll also get a boost when you know what part of the day is optimal for you to work at your most challenging and creative tasks. It’s Ultra(dian) Easy Humans run on a 24-hour internal “clock,” which is why we all typically go to sleep, wake up, and experience alertness peaks and valleys around the same time every day. The times may be different for everyone, but the cycle is universal.  We refer to that 24-hour cycle as a “circadian day;” within that 24-hour circadian day, we cycle through periods of 90-minute blocks of productivity and heightened focus . Those blocks of premiere productivity time are known as “ultradian cycles,” and the manner in which we cycle in and out of them is called our “ ultradian rhythm .” The start of each ultradian cycle is where your brain is most energetic and focused. Eventually, your energy slowly depletes. At the end of each ultradian cycle, you can keep working, but you simply won’t be as effective. Your brain needs downtime. So, since pushing through that downtime means you’re working with less than optimal focus and energy productivity researchers are suggesting a new approach . When you find your peak productivity times — your personal ultradian rhythm—that’s when it’s prime time to tackle projects involving creative strategizing, problem-solving, and critical decisions.  Hit the hard, challenging, out-of-the-box stuff during these peak phases . You can save more routine tasks, less complex problem-solving, and other less brain- and creativity-intensive work for your naturally-occurring ultradian valleys. Think of them as your focus refractory periods. To be more productive, then, you need to know when your ultradian cycles are. Finding out is easier than you think. Gather Data on You While it’s easiest just to announce that you’re a night owl and you should, therefore, work later in the day, or that you enjoy your morning hours, consider applying a more systematic approach. Gather some data . At the same times each day, at roughly hourly intervals, record your levels of focus, enthusiasm, and energy. To account for changes to your daily routine, be sure to add a note about anything which may be affecting your scores for that day. PRO TIP: Here’s a template you can use in Evernote to track your circadian rhythms. Rate yourself hourly using a 1-5 scale. After just a few days of data gathering, you’ll start to see a pattern developing of when your focus, energy, and enthusiasm appear highest and lowest. Stick with logging in your data, and after a week or two, you’ll have some consistent indicators of what times of day or night your ultradian cycles will be available to help you boost your productivity. Work Your Data Now that you know when it’s likely you’ll have the most energy and focus, it’s up to you to optimize those periods of time for spans of uninterrupted time to work or create.  An example of a productive ultradian cycle workday might go something like this: 8:00 am: Your data shows you tend to hit an ultradian cycle as soon as you start your workday. Get settled at your computer, focus on your project for a 90-minute burst. 9:30 am: Break time! Get up and walk to the coffee maker, take a lap around your building, or take the dog out for 20 minutes. 10:00 am: Refreshed, head back to your desk and begin your second productivity work burst. 11:30 am: When you’ve hit your limit, it’s time to turn your attention to a variety of less focused work for several hours, like touch-base meetings with colleagues, returning emails, and other daily tasks. 3:00 pm: Finish up the afternoon (or evening or middle of the night, depending on how you work best), with one last 60-minute productivity cycle. Peak Productivity Preparation Don’t waste your peak productivity time by being underprepared. You want to spend your ultradian cycle time solving difficult problems, pursuing elusive answers, and digging deep for your most creative solutions. Do some prep work ahead of time so that when you turn your attention to your project, you don’t have to stop in the middle of a great work sprint to recharge your laptop, or step away after from drafting your work proposal after only 20 minutes to turn off the stove.  Now is your time to be focused, alert and in full concentration mode. As much as you can, clear your environment of outside interruptions and unnecessary distractions. Interruptions Happen Although we’re suggesting blocks of 90-to-120-minutes of productive time to correspond with your ultradian cycle, the truth is, you might only get an uninterrupted few minutes. Finding out when you work best at peak productivity is only half the battle. Outside influences like coworkers, bosses, phone calls, and kids, can intrude with startling frequency. You’re not always going to get as much done as you’d like, and you can’t help that. All you can do is figure out when your ultradian cycles happen and try to schedule your day so that you can hit that sweet spot where interruptions will be lowest, intersecting with your highest energy cycle. Tend to work between 10 am and 2 pm, but your colleagues tend to get chatty around noon? Instead of surfing the internet until 11:45 and then scrambling to get something done in the last 15 minutes, hit the ground running at 10. Creative Cycles For others, it’s not the outside interruptions that cut into creative time as much as it’s their internal rhythms:  Not everyone hits their ultradian cycles in the exact center of a typical workday. Again, you may need to figure out creative ways to make the best of your ultradian cycles. Some folks work best in the wee hours of the morning; going to bed a little earlier and getting up before the sun allows them the quiet and focus they need. For others, they do their best work once the office has mostly emptied out for the day. The Post-Lunch Slump Hits Again While the least productive time, generally speaking, to get work done is once you’ve hit more than 50 hours in a work-week due to brain fatigue , research indicates that the post-lunch slump is the main contributor what tends to be the least productive time of day: 2:55 pm. That’s a good time to get up and move around to get you through the final push of the workday. You Can Work Smarter Harnessing when you’re firing on all cylinders is a great way to get more done, and done better. But remember, the goal is to be more productive during your peak times, and downshifting when you’re not going to be as efficient. You aren’t trying to speed up your work assembly line. You want to find out when you work more effectively. By discovering when you experience peak productivity times and then using those times most efficiently, you can also experience needed and necessary downtime without the nagging sense of guilt about whether you should or could be doing more.", "date": "2017-10-20,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Discovering the Cure for Lost Work and Lost Time", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/discovering-the-cure-for-lost-work-and-lost-time/", "abstract": "Had a bad day at work? If you find yourself ending your day frustrated and grumpy, it may be because you spend too much time looking for something you needed, and you aren’t getting things done. Details and important documents are hidden within scattered projects, and you couldn’t reach teammates located across multiple time zones. Or maybe it was because of this: so many people were trying to get your attention in so many different ways—email, instant messages, calls, meetings—that you couldn’t find the focus you needed to accomplish anything. No, we weren’t spying on you. You just fell into one (or more) of the top aggravations people encounter at work. Scattered info does more than ruin our days. It ruins our productivity. And we at Evernote care about productivity. A lot. Platforms and apps designed to make us faster suck up our time A McKinsey Global Institute study revealed that people spend 19 percent of their time in an average work week just searching for things. That’s almost a full day lost from a five-day work week, and the effect is compounded by the time needed to get back on track after an interruption (as much as 25 minutes, according to a separate study by Gloria Mark at the University of California, Irvine). The McKinsey report suggests that if employees could regain all that lost time, productivity would go up by as much as 30 to 35 percent. The solution to this problem can be complicated. We often turn to technological solutions that promise to speed us up, but McKinsey estimated that only 5 percent of all the companies they surveyed are using that technology to its full potential. In fact, many companies are clogging up their workflows by misusing the technology designed to help them. A study by Hubspot also noted that people are wasting time at work, and we’re not talking about time spent updating Instagram. 82 percent of respondents said they spend an hour a day just logging into and managing the many different systems they’re required to use. Most companies have up to five different applications to store and share information, and one extreme example in the study reported a staggering 88 different apps that employees needed to manage. But when projects sprawl across a multitude of systems, apps, and platforms, how can we possibly manage them effectively? We’re not even sure who put which document into which system. And those systems don’t talk to one another, so there’s no way to look for information globally. No wonder employees spend so much time searching for things. The right tools at the right time Which is not to say such tools are bad. And it’s fine to use more than one. But the first step to regaining control is for everyone on your team to agree on how each tool should be used. Some communication apps best lend themselves to specific situations, says Dr. Beat Bühlmann, Evernote’s General Manager of EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and an expert in team productivity and dynamics. As he explains it, “If our house is on fire, we don’t email the fire department.” In his team, phone calls still take top priority, especially if the question is urgent. Messaging is better for quick one-off conversations, and email, which is especially vulnerable to being misinterpreted or getting lost in the shuffle, is the medium of last resort. With his communication apps focused on communication, Beat turns to Evernote Business as the place to get the work done. For his Zürich-based team, Evernote works like a Swiss Army knife for business productivity. It’s a place to create, store, scan, and find documents of all types, synchronize projects across physical boundaries, and eliminate the perceived need for multiple apps. Learn more about Evernote Business » The theory in practice Leadflow, a digital marketing agency based in Hungary, took this advice to heart when organizing the workflow for their entirely virtual office. Without a central physical location, it was crucial that the small team located in different cities be able to find up-to-date information quickly and not duplicate work. They implemented a system within Evernote Business in which each client gets a dedicated notebook. A Table of Contents in each notebook is linked to individual documents and frequently updated, so no employee is ever more than a couple of clicks away from the precise document they need. To make it even easier, the team members agreed on a convention for tagging documents using symbols. Everyone on the team understands, for example, that the symbol “@” stands for “client name,” “$” means “project name,” and “#” means “topic,” so searching by document type across the many notebooks is remarkably efficient. While these particular standards might not fit every team, they’ve given Leadflow a clear understanding how to find each bit of information, and the team members have embraced them. Instead of locking important information away on individual hard drives or burying them on a bulk storage service, it’s in everyone’s best interests to ensure that all materials are collected, organized, and shared in Evernote. Once you’ve set your rules of engagement and collected all your team’s important information in one place, keeping that knowledge alive, even as your team changes over time, should be no problem. Get everyone in your organization to commit, and make sure those standards become part of onboarding. Once everyone is on the same page, finding and managing work across teams is easy, and it’ll put an end to a bad day at the office. Learn more about Evernote Business »", "date": "2017-10-18,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "3 Ways Evernote Helps You Harness Ideas in Slack", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/3-ways-evernote-helps-you-harness-ideas-in-slack/", "abstract": "Whether you’ve been using Evernote for nine minutes or nine years, you’ve no doubt seen how it can help you (or your entire team) become more productive at work. But the road to greater team productivity is far from smooth. Paradoxically, the very apps promising to liberate us can actually make it harder to get anything done, by creating more places for our ideas to hide. Here at Evernote, we believe the secret to getting more done isn’t more apps, but making sure that the apps we do have play well together. Jotting down a thought or finding an idea worth sharing often happens when we’re doing other things, such as chatting with co-workers. That’s why we’re so pleased to announce a new integration with the highly popular messaging app, Slack . Evernote is where you keep all your ideas, and Slack connects your ideas to other people. By removing the friction between these two tools, you can now spend less time searching and more time doing. Learn more » To get started, here are the top three ways that Evernote and Slack can bring your ideas together and help you achieve more. 1. Create a ‘note to self’ Evernote has always been about capturing ideas at the speed of thought. How many times have you had a brilliant idea, only to find that a pen and paper—or their digital equivalents—are nowhere in sight? When you’re in the middle of a conversation, the last thing you want to do is stop to look for somewhere to write it down… and then forget where you put it. This can occur even in productive environments, such as Slack conversations with co-workers. Your thoughts might be related to the subject at hand (“I need to review next month’s sales numbers”), or they could be completely unrelated (“I need to buy bread on the way home tonight”); either way, if you don’t capture that idea immediately, “I’ll jot it down later” can all too easily turn into “What was I supposed to remember?” Stay in the conversation and in the flow by using the /note command. Think of it as your digital scratchpad, a place where you can jot down your ideas and thoughts, create a to-do list or a reminder—all without leaving the conversation in Slack. Got another idea or three? You can add to your note over the course of the day, and review it in Evernote when you’re ready. Don’t worry, the note will be private to you—invisible to your conversation partners in Slack—and it’ll be safely waiting for you in Evernote when you need it later. 2. Clip attachments…or entire conversations (and search inside them later) Evernote allows you to harness your team members’ collective brainpower, so you can capture ideas from anywhere and keep related information together. With this new integration, the next time your team is having a particularly fruitful conversation in Slack, use the /clip command to save those messages—based on date, importance, or URL—as a note in Evernote. Later you can search your notes to recall the details of that market-busting idea (because you shouldn’t have to come up with all the brilliant plans alone, right?). You can also save images, PDFs, and documents from Slack conversations to Evernote so they’re easy to find when you need them. When an image or document is posted in a Slack channel, use /clip to save that message to a new note in Evernote, where it will be stored for future reference. Save whiteboard brainstorming sessions or shared files, and find what you need later using Evernote’s text recognition ability. 3. Share your knowledge with the team TEAM: “Can you pull up last year’s sales results for us?” YOU: “Hold on, I know I have them saved somewhere.” And then the search begins. Sound familiar? You’ve got better things to do than switch apps and then manually dig through endless nested folders to find the information you need; leave the digital forensics to the experts. Evernote organizes all your data in one place where you can find it easily, and with the /find command you can now search for the specific note you need and share a snapshot with the team without leaving Slack. All you have to do is enter any search term and Evernote will present you with the top three results. Don’t worry about accidentally sharing this information with the people in the Slack channel—until you decide to share the results, you are the only person who can see them. To share them in Slack, click “Post here” and everyone in the channel will be able to see the note. No archaeology degree required. Bonus tip: one more way to share with the team OK, we promised you three tips, but because we’re so excited about this integration, here’s one more: If you already know which note you want to share with your team, simply copy and paste its URL into Slack to share a preview of the note. Evernote will show the entire note (as long as it’s under 4,000 characters) and the largest image in the note. Productive teams get things done Steve Jobs , a man who knew a thing or two about harnessing the power of teams, once said , “Great things in business are never done by one person; they’re done by a team of people.” Connecting Evernote and Slack makes it easier for your team to collaborate, share knowledge, and achieve great things.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Déjà Vu at the Office? 3 Ways to Stop Duplicating Work", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/3-ways-to-stop-duplicating-work/", "abstract": "We’ve all been there. We get one of those elusive “a-ha” moments at work, and we spend hours developing the plan. We write the slide deck, we pitch the idea, and we put the roll-out plans in place, dreaming of glory. And then a coworker casually mentions that they tried the same idea—three years ago. Oh, and by the way, it didn’t work. Or, it happened five years ago and was discontinued two years ago, right before we got there. We’re deflated. We cannot believe that this hasn’t been captured somewhere. Or if it was, where is it? Did nobody remember that the company had already done this thing? Maybe your horror story is a little different: with minutes to spare before the big meeting, you know that you need to present a particular chart. But who created it? Is it on their computer, is it in a deck someone else presented, is it somewhere on the shared drive? What…was…it…called? You panic and think, “I can recreate this from memory.” So you throw something together. Now, there are two versions of the same document. In the future, someone may alter the other one, and then there are three. Because you duplicated an existing document, you’ve wasted time, energy, and possibly caused a flurry of confusion when the similar documents invariably come together. These scenarios sound like the plot of a work-based sitcom, but they happen in companies around the world every day. You can stop some of these before they go too far. Other companies have not been so lucky. 3 tips for preventing duplication People are only human, and business moves fast. So unless your team is made up of people with exceptional organizational skills, you are going to lose some details of your work. It’s only natural. But the resulting duplication doesn’t have to be a fait accompli. Put systems in place to increase transparency, make things easier to find and next to impossible to lose. But how do you start? 1. Keep everything together. Some team members may prefer to work in Microsoft Office, while others are loyal to Google Drive. It’s hard to reference previous work when it’s stored in so many places. But if everything gets put into Evernote Business, anyone on any team can use the search feature to find work in seconds, regardless of app affiliation. Having that kind of transparency prevents duplication from “do-overs”— repeating work you’ve done before. It’s even more helpful to be able to quickly search through your colleagues’ efforts to see what’s come before or figure out what others are working on. In Evernote Business, you can add Google Drive files , attach Office docs and PDFs, and insert images. You can even capture important conversations from Slack . Keep each project in its own notebook, or use tags to organize across notebooks. Don’t forget to share those notes with your teammates, or even across teams. And remember that this approach works best when everyone is on board with putting all their work into Evernote Business. When everything from notes and ideas to final projects is available in a single workspace, everyone saves time and money. When you’re wrapping a project up, don’t leave your future self in the dark. Document all the metrics and notes for how the project performed in the same notebook, right alongside the other stages of the project. That way, the next time you or a colleague has a great idea that’s related to your project, they’ll be able to build on your ideas (and know which ones worked and which didn’t) without wasting time or duplicating effort. Learn more about Evernote Business » 2. Research before you commit . Before you’re off and running toward your next project, take time to investigate. Has anything like this been attempted before? If so, how did it go? And is there anything from previous efforts that you might be able to re-surface and use again? When everyone puts their materials in Evernote Business, you’ll have a complete reference of previous work that you can search in seconds, even if the original work was done years ago or created by someone who is no longer with the company. See how one company uses Evernote Business to ensure completed projects and scrapped ideas are turned into valuable reference material, accessible from anywhere and available for everyone to tap into. 3. Pay it forward. When you complete a project, you owe it to your future self (and to future colleagues) to leave a legacy of your work. Do your part to ensure that others can use that knowledge by sharing with teammates or publishing to the company. Make things easier to find by agreeing on a set of rules for titles and tags. That way, all your work will be readily accessible, and others will be able to easily understand which notes are relevant to their search. Another thing you’ll appreciate in the future is creating a table of contents , so that it will take seconds to find not only a completed project but every document associated with it. Duplicated work is frustrating and time- consuming, but with a little forethought (and Evernote Business), your team can skip starting from scratch and get straight to the good stuff.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "A Novel Strategy: How to Organize Big Writing Projects", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-to-organize-big-writing-projects/", "abstract": "Every November, hundreds of thousands of writers around the world come together in a fun, freewheeling virtual community. In an annual explosion of creativity, these intrepid souls undertake to write a 50,000-word novel in just 30 days. Say hello to National Novel Writing Month (a.k.a. NaNoWriMo). As sponsors of this annual extravaganza, we know that more than a few NaNoWriMo participants turn to Evernote to collect ideas, plan their stories , and even write their drafts. We also know from experience that a project of that size means piling up a lot of notes, from plotting brainstorms to character descriptions to mountains of online research. That mass of notes can become pretty intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be. The reason you put them in Evernote in the first place was to make them easy to find and use, right? So relax. With a plan and a few minutes of effort, you can clean up even the most unwieldy writing project and organize it to suit the way you like to work. 3 ways to organize your novel’s notes Method 1: Standardize your titles The simplest way to organize a novel-sized writing project (or any big project) is to create a new notebook dedicated to that project. Move all the notes for your project into that notebook, and just search for the notes you need. Easy-peasy. But if you’re referring to lots of different notes on a regular basis, you may not want to do that much searching. You can make things easier on yourself by using consistent names for all your project notes. For example, let’s imagine your name is Cervantes and you’re writing a story called Don Quixote . (Nice title! That sounds like a best-seller.) You could give all your story notes consistent names, like this: Quixote | Character – Don Quixote Quixote | Character – Dulcinea Quixote | Character – Sancho Panza Quixote | Plotting – Outline Quixote | Plotting – Scene List Quixote | Research – La Mancha Quixote | Research – Windmills By sorting your note list alphabetically, each type of note (in this example, characters , plotting , and research ) is automatically grouped together for easy scanning. Or if you do search, the title tells you exactly what the note contains in a way you can instantly understand. You don’t have to follow this specific format; the point is to get into the habit of using one format for all the relevant notes so they’re easy to sort and comprehend. Method 2: Stack it Another way to give your notes some structure is to use multiple notebooks and combine them in a stack . Each notebook can be dedicated to a single type of note, so you know exactly where to file new information to look for it later: In this case we have four notebooks, one for each main area of organization. We might further organize the notes like this: IDEAS NOTEBOOK Dialogue snippets Inspirational photos Scene ideas CHAPTERS NOTEBOOK Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 RESEARCH NOTEBOOK Clipped articles Glossary of useful phrases Maps STORY BIBLE NOTEBOOK Character profiles Locations Synopsis This system adds another layer of organization. It also takes more work to manage, because you have to be consistent about filing things in the right place. Also remember that each notebook will need a unique name, so you may have to get clever if you’re managing multiple novels in Evernote. Method 3: Organize with tags Here’s a way to combine the simple, flat structure of the first method with the organizational power of the second. Instead of spreading notes around in multiple notebooks, use Evernote’s tagging feature to get a similar result. First set up a single notebook with all the notes you need, then tag each note: Use any tagging system you like, but here are a few starter ideas: Chapters: indicates a chapter note Characters: for all character profiles Research: for all research topics Plus one tag for each main character’s name Now when you search for a tag, you’ll see all the tagged notes grouped together. To get the most out of this method, create shortcuts for your most important tags so you can access all the relevant notes in a single click. Using tags and shortcuts makes it easy to navigate large projects with a lot of notes. A single note can have any number of tags. If you go with a tag-based system, remember that tags work across notebooks, so you’ll need unique tags for each novel project. An easy way to handle that is to add a prefix: For example, you could start tag names for Don Quixote (seriously, someone should write that book) with “DQ-” to keep them unique to that novel. A word about writing your draft in Evernote Now that you have all of your research and planning notes organized and easy to find, what about the draft of the novel itself? Writing a draft directly in Evernote isn’t for everyone, but it has a few advantages . Your draft is in the same place as your notes and research, so you don’t have to hop between apps. And it’s kept in sync, so you can start a chapter at home, add a few words on the train, and maybe even get in a bit of creative writing at the office during your lunch hour. If you’re writing a book in Evernote, you can try to keep the entire draft in a single note (notes can hold a lot of text, even an entire novel), but you’ll probably be better off keeping each chapter in its own note and using one of the organizational systems above to keep them organized. PRO TIP: If you use Evernote for Mac and need to refer to another note while you work, type ⌘ T to open a second tab without leaving the note you’re working in (requires the desktop version of Evernote and Mac OS X Sierra or later).

Balancing both your dedication to work routine and your ability to take breaks are crucial for quality results, thoughtful breakthroughs, and maintaining mental well-being. Incorporating routine into your workday—think of it as a way of automating your approach to your efforts, to minimize effort—can pay big dividends. Conversely, knowing when to step out of the flow to regroup and recharge can also give a big bump to your effectiveness. Read on for some tips and tricks on how routines and breaks can boost your productivity. It has been shown that adopting routines can make you more productive. In any job (or any typical day, for that matter), there are tasks you need to perform over and over again. A successful work routine might include meeting with your colleagues every Thursday morning for a status update, or writing up extensive reports on a biweekly basis. The very repetitiveness of some of these types of projects can allow you to be more effective—if you have a plan to manage repetitive work, you don’t have to put as much effort into how to structure it. You can also make your routines more efficient by keeping templates, checklists, and reminders at the ready— all tools that help you streamline your endeavors . Routine can also help harness your creativity. Many creatives swear by routines: author Stephen King famously sits down at the same time every morning, which he believes allows his writing to “kick on.” He’s trained his brain to associate writing with the placement of the items on his desk, his glass of water, and time at which he enters that environment. Routine is a hallmark of many big thinkers : Charles Darwin enjoyed a lie-down and cigarette at 3:00 pm every day; Mr. Rogers took a regular afternoon nap; and Maya Angelou rented a hotel room in which she wrote every day, while geniuses like Steve Jobs and Albert Einstein liked to wear the same thing every day in order to not expend mental energy on wardrobe decisions. Make Routines Work for You While you can certainly change your outfit as often as you like, a more considered approach to becoming routine-oriented can help you to be more productive. Schedule daily tasks to stay on track. Book regular brainstorming sessions with colleagues. You can also adopt a set of steps for every time you want to harness your focus at your desk. And while routine is how you boost your productivity, remember that you can individualize it to your needs. Mix Things Up Your focus is fine, but you’re feeling a little isolated? Take your laptop outside, to a café, or to a shared workspace to be around others. Time It Differently Want to maintain your weekly brainstorming sessions, but you feel like your team’s inspiration is waning? Schedule these meetings for earlier or later in the day, or as a working lunch if you all could use a blood sugar boost. Even small changes can boost your creativity and productivity simply by shifting around a few details. The downside to being routine-focused is when you confuse it with inflexibility. Gimme a Break Routine is a hallmark of efficiency. That’s why researchers believe that another routine you should consider is building regular breaks into your workday. Taking breaks can also improve both your productivity and creativity. In fact, not talking them can make you less productive. According to researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, concentration is like any other sort of sustained effort—you can only toil away for so long before you become fatigued and reap diminishing returns . Taking a break isn’t always as easy as it sounds. Even with multiple studies touting the effectiveness of workday breaks, people report that they have trouble taking them ( or they take them, but feel bad about it ). According to a Staples study of office workers and managers, more than 25 percent of people who spend eight hours or more at work don’t take a break other than lunch. Another study found that just one in five employees even take a lunch break. You already know that you simply cannot work at top speed for the entire day. You need to step away and recharge at regular intervals in order to deliver thoughtful, quality work. How to best recharge is different for everyone—you may need to take a walk, while someone else really gets their reboot from a cup of coffee and a few minutes of small talk. In a perfect workplace scenario, employees would feel comfortable taking cognitive recharge breaks when they need them, and managers would facilitate those breaks. In the real workplace, it’s up to you to be aware of when you’re lagging and take care of yourself. How Often to Break Concentration and productivity levels are different for everyone, which is why you should take time to figure out how and when you work best. Try charting your ultradian cycles to see when you experience your peak productivity times, and harness those times so that you can work smarter rather than just longer. If you’re in the zone, don’t stop for a break if you don’t feel like you need it. But you should keep tabs on how you’re doing. If you begin to feel that your focus is waning, or if you catch yourself daydreaming, it’s time to recharge. The whole idea behind taking a break is to avoid the diminishing return of working when you’ve run out of gas. Breaking Bad While breaks are necessary and good, be aware that you can abuse your breaks. Don’t let your “15-minute internet surfing refresher” turn into a last season’s Game of Thrones episode binge-fest. Keep one eye on the clock. Better yet, get up and move away from your computer, if that’s where you’ve been putting in all your time. Go for a walk or hit the gym, if you can make the time. If nothing else, enlist a co-worker to take a quick stroll with you to grab a coffee or do a brisk walking lap around the building. Let your break be an actual break, where your mind wanders and you do not think about work at all. Studies show that problem-solving is often easiest when your brain is “ diffuse thinking .” Diffuse thinking happens when your conscious mind is relaxed and you begin to make connections in a seemingly random fashion. That’s why, in theory, workplace startups have ping pong tables and other forms of recreational, non-focused activities on hand. Apart of from providing fun, a game of ping-pong allows you to stop working on a problem and lets your brain to go into diffuse thinking mode. Taking a work break can be the thing that allows you to work better. Get the Bigger Picture Another great reason to take regular breaks: goal reactivation. Cognition , a 2011 study showed that by working continuously on a task, you run the risk of losing sight of your objective. Even a 15-minute break allows you a sort of “reset.” When you come back to your task, you must reorient yourself to your goal, which helps you to see the project in a more holistic fashion. When you do that, you are more likely to catch mistakes. A regular routine in tandem with systematic breaks is the energy management tool that will let you get the most out of your workday.", "date": "2017-11-3,"},

Or at least staying with the same company? Though it seems odd today, there was a time when it wasn’t uncommon for a person to begin a job with a company and retire from that same company decades later with the ubiquitous parting gift of a gold watch. Business teams work much differently now. Business moves far more rapidly than ever before, and the workforce is changing at a similar pace. In corporate America, up to 40 percent of employees are now contractors. A recent study commissioned by Upwork and the Freelancer’s Union predict that the global workforce will be more than 50 percent freelance within ten years. Even for full-time “permanent” employees, the average tenure in a single company dropped to 4.2 years in 2016. With so many employees coming and going, and an increasing trend toward remote workers, it’s often hard for teams to maintain continuity across projects, organizations, and time. Even worse, something vital is getting lost: institutional knowledge. What shared memory means to business teams It doesn’t matter how big your business is. Whether you have four or 400 employees, and whether they’re with you for a few months or a few years, they all have a piece of the puzzle that keeps business humming. In the old-world style company, those puzzle pieces stuck together with the glue of tenure—people who remember what happened when you tried that “new idea” six years ago; who know where the projects from last spring are stored, what happened when we hired that agency a few years back, or what the combination to the storage facility is. Or that you even have a storage facility. Now, it’s easier than ever to forget completed work. People move on, freelancers store work on computers that get wiped when they leave. Companies lose track of great freelancers they might have liked to continue working with, but whose contact information evaporated when the manager that hired them left. Teams can lose the narrative on projects in progress. It’s even difficult to maintain a consistent brand and voice when so many people work on it over many years. Shared memory is the lifeblood of any company, but the gig economy we’ve all come to depend upon for up-to-the-minute success can potentially cut us off at the knees. How do we get the best of both worlds? Bypassing the chaos Meet Nicole Hanusek. As the owner of the San Francisco-based boutique web design firm Smack Happy Designs , Nicole is only too familiar with the risks of losing institutional knowledge. Her business model relies on a remote staff of freelance designers and employees she can tap into as needed. She hired the best people she could find, without regard to their physical location. But as all good web designers know, organization is everything. She needed all of her workers to be on the same page from the moment they started. From pricing to graphics to timelines, it was crucial that any Smack Happy employee present a unified message to any client at any moment, with no room for misunderstanding or miscommunication. Nicole created a series of business processes and templates in Evernote Business, which she and any of her team members can access from anywhere. From Evernote, she can not only manage projects and share work with clients, but she can also keep an up-to-date record of every piece of work her company does. Her team can easily find everything they need with a quick search or a set of shortcuts, so they don’t have to worry about losing work or shared knowledge. Employees may come and go with the times, but their work always stays at Nicole’s fingertips. Which is just where she needs it to be. Learn more about how Evernote Business can organize your entire company quickly and cost-effectively » Evernote Business and the gig economy The gig economy is probably here to stay. So here are a few tips to help you keep your records and work streams unbreakable. Keep it all together. Select one place for storing all your company’s work, both past and ongoing. You wouldn’t store your family photo collections in thirty unrelated boxes, so why would you do that to your team’s collective knowledge? In Evernote, any document, photo, audio recording, or project from any time in your company’s history is never more than a couple of clicks away. If your team works in Google Drive, you can drop links from Google directly into Evernote to keep project docs alongside your notes. Evernote also integrates with Slack , so capturing important conversations and decisions in notes is even quicker and easier. Standardize your archives. The old saying about being condemned to repeat history if we don’t remember it holds especially true in business. Without a reliable, accessible index, you might find yourself or your employees re-doing completed work , or launching the same initiatives that were tried several years ago. Once your archives are in Evernote Business, use a consistent set of notebooks, tags, and naming conventions to make your archives easy to navigate and understand, even for the teammates you haven’t hired yet. But don’t stress over perfection: Evernote’s powerful search functionality will find any word in a document so that even if a note gets mislabeled, you can still find it instantly. Share with your team. To get the most out of your knowledge archive, be sure to share relevant notes with the people who may need them. Whether you choose to share notes with just a few members of your team or publish notebooks to the entire company, you control how, when, and where to share it.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Stuck in the Middle: Conquering Writer’s Block", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/conquering-writers-block/", "abstract": "The nightmare begins something like this: The Writer is in her groove, typing or scribbling away. The words are flowing beautifully, then, suddenly… nothing. The Writer has hit a wall. All momentum vanishes. She can’t focus. She can’t think. The frustration boils over, and the words are abandoned. Pretty scary, huh? Every writer has moments like this, especially during National Novel Writing Month , a.k.a NaNoWriMo. Maybe you’re stumped about what comes next, unsure of how to move forward. Or perhaps your motivation is gone and you can’t make yourself move forward. Writer’s block is a common complaint. And although some experts, including Grant Faulkner, Executive Director of NaNoWriMo , say it isn’t real, that it’s just an excuse we give ourselves once the going gets tough, it sure feels real when you’re in the middle of it. And it can be demoralizing. But there are ways out. Problem 1: Not sure how to proceed In our Writer’s nightmare, the woods ahead are dark and scary. There are are many paths forward, but it’s impossible to tell which ones lead to “happily ever after” and which ones lead to fetid bogs of bubbling quicksand and Rodents of Unusual Size. It’s easier to make no choice at all than to make the wrong one, so the Writer freezes in place. Not good. So how do you decide which way to go? Look at the writing and planning you’ve already done. If you don’t know where the story is going at all, it may be time to step back and do some big-picture plotting . If you know where you need to go but not how to get there, open a new note and try these techniques: Skip ahead. There’s no rule that says you have to write chapters in order. If you’re stuck on one scene but have ideas for a later one, write that instead. You can always fill in the gaps later. Think backward. Imagine your story at the next milestone, then walk it back one step at a time. What needs to happen, logically, to get your characters to that point? Change your perspective. Write from another character’s point of view, or leave the main narrative and try a flashback. Give yourself a prompt. Take one element from what you’ve written so far (like a person, or a room, or the town where your story takes place). Write about that in as much detail as you can. Maybe you can use this material later, maybe not. But it gets you thinking about the story in new ways. Or better yet, join a NaNoWriMo word sprint to get those words flowing. Problem 2: Lack of motivation Back in nightmare-land, our Writer is in real peril. It’s not that she’s having problems with the story, it’s that she can’t seem to stay in the writing chair. Life is stressful enough, and the pressures of writing aren’t making things easier. Before you go over the edge, ask yourself why you’re not motivated: Do you have story fatigue? If you like the piece you’re working on but you’re tired of thinking about it, set it aside for a little while and write something else, like a blog post or some flash fiction . When you come back, think about the story as a whole instead of the little details. Remember that great idea you had at the very beginning? The one that got you started in the first place? Go back there, play with the idea, and get excited about your story all over again. Are you physically exhausted? Brains are energy hogs, and they need downtime . Set your story aside and go for a walk, or get a good night’s sleep. A fresh mind is a productive mind. No time to write? Our Writer knows all about this one. She’s juggling work, family, and a dozen hobbies, and every time an email or tweet shows up, the phone chirps and she just has to look. Sound familiar? You can’t write if you’re distracted. Luckily, there are many ways to build focus and discipline as a writer. Here are five . Do you think your writing is bad? This is almost guaranteed to come up at some point during NaNoWriMo. When you’re focused on speed and raw word count, some of what you write will not measure up to your own standards of quality. And that’s okay! Give your “inner editor” a vacation. You can edit, revise, and improve your writing all you want… after you finish your rough draft . But you can’t fix it if you never write it. Are you not feeling creative? Feeling like you’re not creative enough to keep (or even begin) writing is a common struggle. Grant Faulkner says that by participating in NaNoWriMo, by realizing that you are a writer and that you are a creator, you are much more likely to be creative in your everyday life. So next time you’re not feeling creative, remind yourself that you’re a writer because you write . However it manifests for you, writer’s block is a common and perfectly natural experience. The important thing is not to let those nightmare moments turn into days, weeks, or worse. We hope these suggestions will help you get back on track when the going gets rough.", "date": "2017-11-16,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Can You Get Your Productivity in Tune with Music?", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/can-you-get-your-productivity-in-tune-with-music/", "abstract": "Sometimes it seems we’re surrounded by music. It’s hard to walk along the sidewalk, enter a building, or even sit at work or in a public place without being exposed to some type of music. A car drives down the block sharing the song of the moment. The coffee shop has something playing in the background. That jogger’s headphones allow us to hear the faintest hints of what they’re listening to. Music—and our access to the tunes we like—is so ever-present that it’s almost second nature to have it playing when we’re trying to do something else. But is that a good idea? The answer is that it is—and it isn’t. It all depends on what we’re doing and what the music we’re listening to is. It’s not even a matter of “the more complicated the task, the less we should listen.” A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that brain surgeons who listened to music while operating outperformed those who didn’t. What does seem to be clear from most research, though, is: Music can improve our mood While there are times when we want to sulk and listen to something gloomy and self-pitying, in most cases, when we’re listening to music, it’s something that makes us happy. Music energizes us, so our moods naturally improve. A study by Dr. Teresa Lesiuk revealed “the value of music listening for positive mood change and enhanced perception … while working … provided … positive mood alteration.” In other words, people who listened to music while working were happier and more creative. Cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Levitin (who’s also a musician) suggests that there may be benefits to listening to music for 10-15 minutes before beginning a task that requires concentration or attention. Music releases dopamine and serotonin into our brains, which helps us feel pleasure, relax, and focus better. Interestingly, if a person is performing repetitive tasks—such as working on an assembly line—being distracted by music can help relieve some of the tedium. According to Dr. Lesiuk, people who listen to music complete their tasks more quickly and come up with better ideas than those who don’t. “When you’re stressed,” she wrote, “you might make a decision more hastily; you have a very narrow focus of attention. When you’re in a positive mood, you’re able to take in more options.” Pro Tip: On the iconic TV show American Bandstand , host Dick Clark used to ask people to rate a song they just heard. Become your own music critic. Use Evernote to jot down opinions about artists, albums, songs, and live performances. Rate them according to what’s important to you. That way, you’ll have a handy list of song suggestions for each mood. For premium focus, listen to what you know At work, the trend toward open offices presents new challenges for focus. If you’re working in a noisy and distracting place—with loud co-workers, outside noise, or anything that can pull your attention—one of the best solutions may be to put on a pair of headphones to help drown out the cacophony with pleasant or familiar music that will allow you to focus. The best kind of music here may be something you’re already familiar with. Content marketing strategist Gregory Ciotti points out that trying to take in new information can take you out of what you’re supposed to be doing: “With familiar music, you know what lies ahead. Paying attention requires less focus.” Let the happiness and relaxation of listening to something you like take you to a comfortable space that allows you to get work done. Lyrics can distract us If your work involves working with words, and you love listening to music with lyrics while you work, Ciotti has bad news for you. He compares listening to music with lyrics while performing language-based tasks to “holding a conversation while another person talks over you … while also strumming a guitar.” You’re trying to make your brain do too many things at once, meaning that none of them will be done well. But if you’re a numbers person, you might be in luck. Dr. Lesiuk’s study showed that software designers, whose work didn’t deal strictly with words, had a greater output while listening to music with lyrics. The best solution here, according to Dr. Amit Sood of the Mayo Clinic, is to find classical, ambient, or other lyric-free music that sets an appropriate mood that is conducive to the task at hand. When college students attended lectures that were accompanied by classical music, their test results were much higher. The right music for your productivity Since everyone’s musical tastes differ, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to what to listen to and when, but there seems to be little doubt that the right music played at the right time (familiar and comforting music before a task that requires concentration; old favorites when you need to be distracted from repetition) can give your productivity the right tempo.", "date": "2017-11-21,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "6 Big HR Headaches for Small Business…Cured", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/6-big-hr-headaches-for-small-business/", "abstract": "Quick question: Who, in a typical company, knows every person in the office? Chances are, the person you thought of works in Human Resources (HR). Even in the largest organizations, the HR department is responsible for the personal well-being and professional success of everyone who works there. Your company may not have the luxury of a dedicated HR department. In fact, as a small business owner, you probably wear many different hats : CEO, sales director, marketing guru, and, yes, human resources manager. This comes down to necessity—when you’re building a business from scratch there often isn’t the budget to hire someone for each of these roles. The problem is that, for many business owners, people management becomes an afterthought, taking a back seat to the primary goal of ‘getting s$!$* done.’ Or, if you don’t have any expertise in HR, you may not know where to start. As a result, the task of managing your company’s greatest asset becomes a challenging, and potentially overwhelming, aspect of growing the business. The good news is that with a little planning, and the right organizational tools, you can eliminate much of this pain and demonstrate your commitment to effective human capital management . Let’s look at six of the most common HR challenges your small business is up against today, and how Evernote can help you minimize potential issues in the future. 1. Finding the right people Efficient hiring is important to every organization, but there’s no doubt that small companies are at a disadvantage in the hunt for top talent. A recruiter at Apple or Google has amazing candidates knocking on their (virtual) door all day long. Small companies—and startups in particular—have to stand out from the crowd to attract the kind of talented people who will drive business growth. The recruiting advantage enjoyed by larger companies, however, often comes at the expense of agility. Your small company’s secret weapon is your ability to hire quickly, moving candidates through the recruiting pipeline faster. As SHRM (Society for Human Resources Management) advises , “Smaller businesses need to be ‘speedboats’ and outmaneuver sometimes slower, bigger companies when it comes to hiring.” Here are a few tips for increasing your hiring efficiency: Create a notebook in Evernote with job description templates you can reuse. This ensures that you are presenting an accurate, appealing view of your company and the job itself. Save PDFs of applicant resumes in Evernote to prevent qualified candidates from slipping through the cracks. Annotate and share these resumes with everyone involved in the interview process, so they have all the documents they need to make informed hiring decisions. Create a table to track candidates’ progress through the hiring process. For example, you can create columns such as: ‘Application/Resume Reviewed,’ ‘Interviewed by Phone,’ ‘Interviewed In-Person,’ ‘References Checked,’ and ‘Offer Sent.’ As applicants progress from one stage to the next, move their name into the appropriate table column so everyone can see where things stand. Pro Tip : Download this handy template that’ll make applicant tracking a breeze. This interview scorecard can help you keep a record of each candidate you speak to. 2. Getting everyone on the same page The last time you started a new job, what was your first day like? For many people, it can be extremely stressful . As an employer, you can make onboarding easier for your new hires by creating a comprehensive ‘Employee Handbook’ to guide them through the process. Consider saving your handbook in Evernote and sending a public link to new hires before their official start date. It’ll make a good first impression on them, and they’ll have a chance to hit the ground running as they become familiar with the inevitable “How we do things around here.” If you create a “Table of Contents” note that links to individual notes covering important subjects such as company values, time-off policy, benefits information, social media policy, and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies, new employees can acclimate even faster. Of course, details change, people leave, and eventually, you’ll need to update your handbook. Instead of distributing a new printed copy to the entire staff, saving your Employee Handbook in Evernote makes version control simple, so that everyone in the company—regardless of how long they’ve been working there—always has the most up-to-date version. Evernote is also a perfect tool for creating a company intranet. Store announcements from management, upcoming events, notes from company “all-hands” meetings, and more in a notebook available to all employees. Let everyone know that they can find the answers to most of their questions in Evernote and that you’re available to help if they can’t. The bonus? This frees up your time, and you can avoid answering the same questions over and over again. If your company has more than one office, there will undoubtedly be times when employees have to travel from one location to another. How will they get there? Where will they stay? What sights should they check out while they’re in town? Consider crowdsourcing a note and inviting all your employees to offer their travel tips and favorite suggestions of things to see and do in their city. This will help make time spent on the road less stressful and more productive. Pro tip: Download this template for guidance on creating your own Employee Handbook. 3. Streamlining repetitive tasks As we have seen already, templates can save you huge amounts of time , especially when it comes to completing repetitive HR tasks. For example, there are certain details you need to collect from everyone in your company: emergency contact information, I-9s, W-4s, health insurance enrollments, 401(k) enrollments, and NDAs (if appropriate). While we don’t recommend that you store the completed forms in Evernote (HR tools such as Workday are better suited for this highly regulated information), you can streamline the process by saving blank forms as templates in Evernote. Employees can access the forms they need and instructions for filling them in, then share their completed versions with you—all with nary a printer in sight. Templates can also come in handy at performance review time. The process often begins with a self-evaluation, so create a template with a list of the criteria by which employees will be measured and a set of questions that will help them reflect objectively on their performance. Pro Tip: Use this template to help set objectives and performance goals for your employees. Later, they can refer to this checklist when assessing how successful they were in meeting these goals. 4. Managing the mountain of information For every benefit that employees enjoy—such as health insurance and professional development programs—you need to conduct countless hours of research and preparation. There are plans you need to compare, vendors to assess, ROI to calculate, and contracts to sign. As the business owner, you have a responsibility to do due diligence to make sure you’re providing maximum value to the company as well as the staff. This creates a mountain of information and contacts that can easily become overwhelming. Make your life easier by saving all this information in Evernote, and using tags, notebooks, and stacks to organize it all. For example, save a PDF of an insurance company’s plan benefits in Evernote, together with a note containing the details for your company rep and any relevant conversations between the two of you. Then, organize these into a notebook using the insurance company’s name. Eventually, you will have a separate notebook for every insurance plan, which you can combine in a stack called “Health Insurance 2018.” Applying this process to any of the employee benefits you manage will help tame the exponential growth of data and make it easy to find the information you need quickly. Pro Tip: For more tips on organizing with notes, notebooks, and tags, check out this article from our Help and Learning site. 5. Helping small business managers manage Remember those “Choose Your Own Adventure” books? This popular series put young readers in charge of the action by letting them decide, at the end of each chapter, which page to turn to next. The option a reader chose would then direct the fate of the main characters, leading to multiple possible outcomes. If you’ve grown your business to the point where the word “small” is an increasingly inaccurate qualifier, you may have a layer of middle management overseeing your staff. One of the many responsibilities of Human Resources is to support these managers and help them do their best work. This means providing them with tools that they can use to manage their teams, such as performance monitoring criteria, conflict resolution guidance, suggested interview questions, etc. In the spirit of the “Choose Your Own Adventure” books, you can use Evernote to empower managers to direct the action to achieve the result they need proactively. By creating links within your notes, you create a ‘self-service’ system that managers can access at all times. Need to write a performance review? Click the link. Need to review resumes for an open position? Look at the template. The answers are always clear, and only a click away. Pro Tip: Read more about how to use note links to connect notes and create your own workflows. 6. Being the bearer of bad news OK, this is a tough one. No one likes to have to tell someone that their time with the company has come to an end, but the unfortunate reality of professional life is that jobs aren’t as “permanent” as they once were, and sometimes end for a multitude of reasons. You can make the process slightly less painful for everyone by creating a notebook in Evernote with strategies for handling these difficult conversations, as well as documenting the legal procedures you’re required to follow when off-boarding an employee. For better or worse, employees often see the function of HR as a ‘buzzkill,’ spoiling everyone’s fun and games (think Toby from The Office) . And while no one enjoys having to let an employee go (we hope), tactfully handling the conversation can help you maintain a professional relationship with a terminated employee, without destroying any possibility of future reconciliation. After all, your former employees will likely tell their network all about their experience with your company; it’s wise to have their last contact be as respectful and efficient as possible. Pro Tip: Find out how CoSchedule uses Evernote to streamline onboarding and 90-day reviews and keep its employees in the loop. Putting your plan into action Small businesses are the main driver of the U.S. economy today, employing 48 percent of all U.S. employees. That’s 56.8 million people. And while you may not have started your small business because you love managing people (although more power to you if you did), it’s an inescapable part of operating any firm larger than a sole proprietorship. Creating a system that helps your employees feel valued and supported doesn’t have to be overwhelming; all it takes is the right tools and a proactive approach to head off most challenges.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Find Out Why a Lack of Sleep is a Productivity Nightmare", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/why-a-lack-of-sleep-is-a-productivity-nightmare/", "abstract": "Feeling a little groggy? Hitting the coffee first thing in the morning to jolt yourself into alertness? Maybe you aren’t getting enough sleep. When we don’t get enough shut-eye, we have trouble concentrating, working, making decisions, remembering things, and being our best selves. We get crabby, tetchy, and unpleasant to be around. But the problem is more serious than just being in a bad mood. The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) says we’re 12 percent more likely to die prematurely if we don’t get the recommended seven to nine hours a night . A lack of sleep can be costly—in more ways than one Lack of sleep can also cost companies real money. A 2016 study by the RAND Corporation found that because of sleep deprivation, the U.S. sustains economic losses of up to $411 billion a year (or 1.23 million working days), nearly three times the $138 billion Japan loses. A 2007 Harvard report showed that the effects of a lack of sleep include reduced efficiency and productivity, more errors, and accidents. These consequences can even be deadly . The Harvard report noted that preventable medical errors, many of which are the result of physicians and surgeons not getting enough sleep, cause more than a million injuries and between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths each year. On a more significant level, the Harvard study showed that some of the deadliest accidents in recent history could be related to sleep deprivation, including, the report noted, the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island , the 1986 nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl , the grounding of the Exxon Valdez , as well as the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. Now that we’ve seen the dangers of a lack of sleep (which are, ironically, enough to keep you awake at night), let’s discuss ways to get your eight hours in as best as you can. A few sleep hacks for better rest Try to keep your routine as regular as you can. A consistent sleeping routine allows our bodies to use their natural cycles most efficiently. Given our busy schedules, it may not be possible to have a set bedtime every night, but small things—not sleeping in on weekends, not trying to “catch up” on sleep, not fighting the body’s natural cycles—can help us sleep more efficiently. Keep a journal of when you feel tired and when you’re more awake. Pro tip: Use a sleep tracking app and store your results in Evernote. Over time, you’ll be able to detect patterns, gain insight into your body rhythms, and you can even share the information with your doctor. Technology is your sleeping self’s friend. Are you on your phone or computer a little too much in the evening? Set an alarm that will tell you when to go to bed. If you find you’re addicted to your electronics, there are many apps that will shut them off. Beware the blue screen of wakefulness. It turns out that the blue light emitted from most electronic devices is Public Enemy #1 when it comes to sleep. It destroys melatonin, one of the hormones that help us sleep. If you have a hard time letting go, there are (fortunately) some apps that will help reduce the blue light that hits our retinas. Make sure your sleeping area is restful . Our bodies work around the cycle of the sun. When it’s light out, we want to be active, and when it’s dark, we tend to shut down. Any sound can creep into our consciousness, so, while no noise is best, white noise (from an app or a machine) can provide a neutral background to block out other, more intrusive, sounds. A good night’s sleep organizes the mind The benefits of getting a good night’s sleep are many, but most notable are: More focus . When you’re fully awake, your mind has an easier time staying clear, your eyes stay open, and you’ll be able to concentrate on your goals. Sharper decision-making . If you’re well-rested, you’ll have the mental capacity to consider more aspects of anything—in fact, the NSF shows that decision-making skills can improve by as much as 4 percent. Improved memory . The end-of-the-day sweeping gets rid of a lot of clutter and allows you to remember the stuff that counts. The 2007 Harvard study cited above showed that the consolidation of information that takes place only during sleep is “essential for learning new information.” Better accuracy. We all know how alcohol impairs our motor and decision-making skills, but being sleep-deprived can impair you by as much as fifty percent more than being under the influence. For many people, the idea of being told that it’s time to go to bed reminds us of being a child. Not only that, we feel like we have too much to do and not enough time to take care of it all in the evenings. Given the alternatives to getting enough sleep, though—poor productivity, inability to concentrate, and health risks that can, in extreme cases, kill us—the benefits of turning out the lights and hitting the hay far outweigh the temptations of staying up late.", "date": "2017-11-30,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "March Doesn’t Have to Drive Your Team Mad", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/march-doesnt-have-to-drive-team-mad/", "abstract": "Every March, millions of otherwise sane Americans succumb to the peculiar ritual of watching college students play basketball. They fill out brackets predicting the winners. They dress in their favorite school’s colors. And, for three mad weeks, they binge-watch games, many of which occur during working hours. While not everyone falls under the spell of the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, enough folks do (70 million people fill out brackets , according to ESPN ) that it has a noticeable impact on productivity, costing companies between $1.3 and $4 billion each year. It’s not hard to see why: few people’s daily grind can match the drama of watching a scrappy underdog beating a hyped favorite. With all those games on all those screens around the office, and phone alerts telling you who just beat whom, it may seem that your company faces only two choices: crack down and restrict any access (and we know how well that idea might go over), or throw in the towel, let you do whatever you want, and lose valuable work hours to hoops. But while getting paid to goof off for a few days may sound like fun, it won’t get your work done. There are actually ways of finding the happy medium of an efficient office and hoops-happy employees. For example, instead of shutting off access altogether, ask your employer to designate times and places where basketball can be enjoyed. A monitor in a conference room not only provides those on a coffee or lunch break with the ability to watch the action, it gives your colleagues who aren’t following along the quiet and privacy they need to be productive. Pro Tip: With so many games being played simultaneously, make a list in Evernote of tip-off times and channels so you won’t miss seeing your favorite team(s) in action. Bonding over brackets There is actually evidence that a more laid-back viewing policy can have unexpected benefits. Polly Mosendz of Bloomberg reports that being allowed to follow the Tournament can actually make employees more productive: “Three-quarters of those polled said they looked forward to going to work more when participating in an office pool.” And the long-term effect of increased workplace camaraderie can ultimately pay off in greater productivity and job satisfaction. Of course, being in a “pool” doesn’t have to mean gambling money. You can compete for small prizes, big trophies, or even time off. You can band together with those in your department, or fellow alumni of a particular school. Even when faced with traditional rivalries, such Duke vs. North Carolina, USC vs. UCLA, and Ohio State vs. Michigan, a little friendly competition can, paradoxically, promote solidarity in the workplace—as long as any “trash-talking” stays friendly, of course—as you bond with your co-workers over a shared love of the game. These alliances and friendly rivalries often cross organizational boundaries, forging bonds that might never otherwise appear. In fact, Mosendz states that 39 percent of those polled “reported becoming closer with a colleague as a result of a pool.” Pro Tip: You can use a shared note or notebook in Evernote as a hub to track and share your Bracketology with friends and colleagues. Tips for managers Thursday and Friday of Week One are the most intense days of the tournament, with 32 games on offer. These early days can be so distracting that some experts suggest companies consider giving employees who are exceptionally productive in the early part of the week the opportunity to knock off early (or take the day off entirely) on Friday as a reward. Pro Tip: Create a note to set task goals for the week and help employees prioritize what they need to get done before the fun sets in. The fact is, focus is going to suffer in mid-March. But wise companies can minimize their losses by investing in their people and finding the perfect balance between work and play. Acknowledge that people going to want to follow the action, and find an acceptable balance between work time and game time. Organized brackets can foster teamwork, generate workplace harmony, and promote friendly competition. Even something as simple as a lunchtime spread of chicken wings, chips and salsa, and veggies in a break room with a television can encourage colleagues to find the right blend between getting their work done and cheering for their favorite team. That gives everyone in the office a chance to share in the excitement—even after their brackets are well and truly busted.", "date": "2018-03-12,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Surviving the Open Office (Really, It’s Not So Bad)", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/surviving-the-open-office/", "abstract": "It’s ten o’clock, and I glance up from my first (okay, second) cup of coffee, only to lose my train of thought. That’s because there’s a visitor in the office. When our recruiter brings new candidates in, she gives them a quick tour, always zipping by my table. “And over here is the marketing team,” she points out. “You see we have an open office, which is really great for collaboration.” A big part of life here at Evernote is our open work environment . We find that it helps us work more collaboratively, develop relationships, and cultivate a transparent culture. And we’re not alone—open offices are everywhere these days. In fact, around 70 percent of US offices have some form of an open concept, according to the International Facility Management Association. But not everyone is a fan. Critical headlines range from “ 9 Reasons That Open-Space Offices are Insanely Stupid ” to “ The Victims of Open Offices are Pushing Back .” Taking shots at the open office is as much in vogue as the open layout itself. I have to admit, even though I’m a stage 5 introvert, some of this pushback seems a little harsh. It’s not that bad, right? So instead of extolling the virtues of open offices or writing a manifesto on why they don’t work, we’ve drawn up the ultimate open office pro-con list. And regardless of which side you’re on, we’ve got tips on how teams and leaders can make open workspaces work. Team open: let’s hear from the pros Despite all of the negativity, proponents of the open office range from Michael Bloomberg to Steve Jobs. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg even hired Frank Gehry to architect the world’s largest open floor plan for a legion of engineers. It’s not hard to see why, especially when you consider the alternatives. Cube farms may give you a modicum of privacy; they were hardly a beloved setup. Ugly, impersonal, and rigid, they’ve been mocked in many a Dilbert comic strip. And while private offices are appealing, giving everyone a corner office is simply unrealistic. (Curse you, Euclidian geometry!) But the open office is not just a trendy corporate initiative to squeeze more people closer together. Here are some other pluses: Let’s collaborate. Ok, you probably saw this one coming a mile away. But yes, you’re more likely to collaborate and connect with your co-workers if you can, you know, see them. You can easily ask for advice without having to intrude on closed doors. Instead of sending an email, you can walk right over and actually talk . In person. And experts agree that face-to-face communication is the best kind. In fact, one study found that a face-to-face request is 34 times more likely to be successful than an email request. The intuition that we’re more likely to collaborate is not without merit. One study found that those on the same floor are 57 percent more likely to collaborate than those who are not. Another study discovered that putting the right workers near each other leads to a 15 percent increase in performance. Getting to know you. Open office plans also increase personal interaction. Unexpected bonds develop as jokes drift the across the room and impromptu lunch outings are organized. And studies have shown that work relationships have a huge impact. Research shows that having just one friend at work makes you more likely to stay. Sparking creativity. Bringing everyone together in an open space can also help get the creative juices flowing. It’s easier to bounce ideas off of each other and organically get others involved through a simple, “Hey, what does everyone think about this?” And while one of the main complaints leveled against open offices is the noise, one study found that we need certain levels of ambient noise to trigger creativity. Total silence can be stifling. Participants in the study who were exposed to 70 decibels worth of background noise (about what you’d find in a coffeehouse) outperformed other groups. Keeping things equal. An open office environment can create a more egalitarian workplace and eliminate the competition for private offices. Many companies, including Evernote, don’t even give senior leaders a private space. This can make company leaders seem more approachable and personable, instead of turning them into intimidating figures employees never interact with. There’s also more accountability. You can see who’s there, who’s not. If you’re putting in long hours, chances are it won’t go unnoticed. On the flip side, you (sadly) can’t spend the whole day looking at dog videos on Twitter when everyone can see your screen. Change it up. Open concepts also allow companies to reconfigure workspaces as needed. If it turns out that putting sales next to engineers was a bad idea, you can change it. No need to commit to a single layout. And this reflects the nature of how we work nowadays. We travel, we work from home, we go to meetings. In short, we’re not always at our desk. And studies show that workstations are unoccupied 60 percent of the time. So we need workspaces that reflect that. Let the light in. Fewer walls equal more natural light. And research shows that natural light improves health , alertness , creativity , and sleep . A study also showed that better workplace lighting was linked to fewer absences. Not to mention the fact that sitting under the windowless flicker of fluorescent lights somehow seems damaging to your soul. You also can’t just get rid of the walls, put everyone at a long table, and hope people collaborate. Culture change, norms, and respect for privacy and deep work also need to develop. Cons: The walls never bothered us anyway Whether it’s the sensation that the CEO is peering over your shoulder or the sinking feeling that you’ll catch a cold from the co-worker who just sneezed, there are some drawbacks of laying it all out in the open. Some argue that all of the benefits of open spaces might not make up for these drawbacks: Do not disturb. Critics contend that while we think the open office will lead to more collaboration, it can actually lead to less. We don’t really want to collaborate all day long—we need time and space to think, too. So we build our own ‘walls.’ We manufacture barriers and find ways to create our own little bubbles of isolation. Most of us recognize the furrowed brow of a ‘don’t bother me’ face. There’s even a whole industry of products to protect yourself, from noise-canceling headphones to pop-up personal tents . As Jason Feifer puts it in Fast Company , “We like talking to each other, but we have been put into an environment that tries to manufacture that talking, and now we do the opposite.” Can you keep it down? One of the biggest complaints among open-office workers is the noise. Personal (and business) phone calls. Brainstorming sessions. Music blaring. People talking to themselves. Chances are if you work in an open office, you’ve heard it all (pun very much intended). A 2013 survey showed that more than two-thirds of US employees are unhappy with the noise levels at work. And while we know a certain amount of background noise can help foster creativity, research has shown that too much open office noise can wipe out those benefits. Unlike when you’re at a coffee shop , at work we know the people making the noise. It’s harder to tune out. Excessive noise has been linked to stress and fatigue. One study even found that noisy offices impair your ability to recall information or even do basic math. It also creates a sort of peer pressure to keep it down, usually conveyed via a carefully placed ‘stink eye’ that makes you less likely to chat. Pass the hand sanitizer. If you feel like you’re constantly getting sick from work, it’s because you probably are. A Danish study found that open office workers had significantly more days of absence due to sickness. A different study found that a lack of private offices caused high blood pressure, stress, and staff turnover. So those coughs and sneezes really may be something to fear. Hold that thought. You’re really in the zone, and then someone creeps up behind you, seemingly out of nowhere. “Hey, do you have a second to chat?” a co-worker says. We’ve all been there. It never lasts just a second and then it’s hard to get back into it. But it keeps happening because when you’re out in the open, you’re somewhat of a sitting duck. Some people assume that you’re free for a chat because they can see you. Whether it’s people physically coming up to you, or just movement in your peripheral vision , open plans can disrupt your thinking and deep work . Research from the University of California showed that workers are interrupted every three minutes and that it can take up to 23 minutes to recover and refocus. A team from George Mason University found that interruptions also degrade the overall quality of your work. Get some ‘alone time.’ Whether it’s taking a personal phone call or having a mini-breakdown, sometimes we just need a minute. We need a chance to be human—we can’t always maintain a perfect facade of productivity. And to have those moments, we need privacy. And for introverts, an open office can be an especially dark place. Constantly interacting with other humans can be exhausting. In her popular TED talk on how our workplaces are designed for extroverts, Susan Cain, author of Quiet, explains this powerfully. She notes that “modern offices have the collaboration element well taken care of, but they’re neglecting the concentration and the contemplation.” The verdict: So like most things in life, there are positives and negatives to working in an open-plan office. And that’s to be expected. It’s hard to design a space that works for everybody. You also can’t just get rid of the walls, put everyone at a long table, and hope people collaborate. Culture change, norms, and respect for privacy and deep work also need to develop. Donna Flynn, the director of Steelcase’s WorkSpace Futures research group, summarized it this way: “The open plan isn’t to blame any more than reverting to all private offices can be a solution. There is no single type of optimal work setting. Instead, it’s about balance.” Tips for making it work If you’re in an open office, here are some ways to cultivate productivity: Put on headphones—but consider the impact of what you listen to on your productivity. Try listening to ambient noise . Assess whether someone is available to chat. Wait until you have multiple questions, try catching him in the hallway, or just send an email if she looks deep in thought. Assume good intent. If you see a co-worker on Facebook, remember that she may need a break. Block off a few hours (or an entire day) on your calendar for some ‘do not disturb/deep work’ time. But not everyone has a say in how the workspace is set up. So here are some tips for leaders to consider: Redesigning or moving to a new space? Ask employees what kind of environment they like instead of making assumptions. Create different kinds of spaces, such as  ‘huddle rooms’ or ‘focus booths’ in addition to collaboration areas. Make sure that there’s a mix of reservation-only and first come-first served spaces so finding a spot isn’t impossible. Look into soundproofing options and materials such as acoustic panels. Already got an open space? Come up with some ground rules as a team. Write down things you all agree on, such as ‘don’t bother me if I have my headphones on.’ Add these to your team notebook in Evernote Business , so everyone always has access. Think about how teams are placed next to each other. Maybe a sales team that’s on the phone all day shouldn’t be right next to the quiet-loving writers. Introduce a work from home day, or no-meeting day. Make it easier to move around and work from anywhere by setting up an information library in a team notebook. Include WiFi, VPN, and video conferencing details. Send sick people home. And model good behavior by staying home yourself. Have conversations with those who aren’t respecting the open space. It can get awkward, but it’s important. Offer a credit that employees can put towards a solid new pair of headphones like we do here at Evernote.", "date": "2017-12-5,"},

You expect it to be dark; it’s pretty far north, and it gets dark earlier the further north you go. My host points out a sudden glow of green light in the sky. The Northern Lights pulsate and glisten and turn the snow a reflective green so that the whole place looks, for a moment, like a glow-in-the-dark toy. It’s a resemblance that all of the employees there cherish. It’s mid-November, and the entire company is in high gear. Their busy season begins in June when the days are long, and the customers are few. The Workshop depends on the holiday season, with little to no time for late shipments. With such short, precise production time and a tight delivery schedule, working in harsh conditions, you’d expect tensions to be high and tempers short. But this workshop depends on Evernote to keep business communication and production running smoothly, so all is calm, all is bright. How the boss manages email himself My companion, a bearded gentleman who looks significantly younger than the age he claims, invites me into his office, pulling off his red outdoor gear and hanging it on the back of the door. (“Gore-Tex,” he whispers. “LL Bean has us on that one.”) Once behind the desk, he whips open his laptop and shows me the vast amount of email he receives daily. He seems to scroll endlessly as his eyes whisk past each request. “That’s a crazy amount of email,” I comment. “You get this every day?” He shrugs, then laughs the nonchalant “Ho Ho Ho” of a CEO who knows he’s steering his company in the right direction. “Sometimes more,” he says. “It’s okay. Watch this.” He opens up the first email, briefly scans it, and then hits ‘Forward.’ He plugs in an Evernote email address that he’s saved in his contacts. With his fingers flying over the keyboard, he adds “@nice,” then “#Spiderman,” followed by “#actionfigure.”  The email disappears. “They all want Spider-Man,” he mutters. “I’m more of a DC man myself, but whatever.” “They say I make a list and check it twice,” he laughs. “Oh, they have NO idea.”—Santa “Wait, what did you just do?” I ask, eager to learn some of the great man’s magic. He explains that he’s forwarding email to Evernote, where he’s using the “@” symbol to sort it into two notebooks he keeps—“@naughty,” and “@nice.” In the same ‘To’ line in the forwarded email, he’s sorting the request by tag, so that his employees can quickly pull up a list of how many of each toy to create. Learn to forward emails to Evernote magically » “Spider-Man car, Spider-Man plush toy, Spider-Man vinyl pop,” he says, scanning his emails. “You have to keep track of all this stuff, and you can’t get it wrong. Evernote keeps it all organized for me. As soon as I add a request to the queue, the E.L.V.E.S. can pull it up on their devices at the same time, so we’re all on the same page.” He winks. “They say I make a list and check it twice,” he laughs. “Oh, they have NO idea.” Field Trip of Dreams I ask to see the factory and to learn more about how the workers use Evernote to organize toy creation. I’m introduced to a small but driven woman named Krystal who heads up E.L.V.E.S. (Employee List Verifiers Entrusted (by) Santa) operations. Krystal, who was, until recently, COO of Lollipop Guild, LLC, embraced Evernote as soon as she arrived at The Workshop. “It used to be that the only path I could reliably follow was made of yellow brick, and that was pretty inflexible. But Evernote updates automatically across everyone’s devices, so we’re always up to date. “We don’t need to keep track of Naughty and Nice like my boss does,” Krystal explains. “We just need to make sure that we’re turning out the right stuff.” She solves that issue by duplicating notes from Santa’s lists and re-inventing them as tables so that all the E.L.V.E.S. can see the production schedule on a single note. Discover Krystal’s secrets for working with tables » “It’s a big job,” Santa admits, sipping a hot cocoa in the break room. “I have to keep my eye on my customers 24/7.” He shakes his head. “Between you and me, it’s kind of boring watching them when they’re sleeping. That’s why I don’t have time to be involved in the day-to-day operations. But wherever I am in the world, I can always check into whatever’s going on because it’s all in Evernote.” How the right toy goes down the right chimney at the right time The Workshop has a unique, proprietary shipping system called SLEIGH, and in charge of that department is Elrod, who comes to The Workshop from MiddleEarth, Inc., with an extensive background in long journeys. One of his challenges was to find software that could integrate with SLEIGH, and he landed on creating shipping manifest templates and keeping records in Evernote. “Nothing gets by me,” Elrod boasts, as packages arrive from the manufacturing floor. “All I have to do is check Santa’s original list and add each line item to the template.” He keeps a note for each package, and since individual notes automatically get a URL in Evernote, Elrod turns each link into a QR code. “I slap the code on each package, and all Santa has to do is use the code reader on his device, and Evernote shows him the right child and address,” he says proudly. “I like to say that we’re sleighing it,” he adds. Make Elrod’s magic with templates in Evernote » Not every employee is directly involved in production at The Workshop. I’m introduced to Belladonna, who works tirelessly as head of the E.L.V.E.S. Resources department. “Keeping employees happy is Belladonna’s main concern,” she tells me, always referring to herself in the third person. Belladonna keeps an up-to-date shared notebook in Evernote that serves as The Workshop’s intranet. There, employees can check out policies on vacations, benefits, and career growth information, as well as have visibility into other areas of the company. From links in Evernote, all the E.L.V.E.S. can track Santa’s journey through NORAD , and keep tabs on the reindeer while a live feed continually updates Santa’s “@Nice” list. See how humans and E.L.V.E.S. alike can manage HR in Evernote » Evernote helps Santa stay on top of trends Santa is particularly excited to have me meet with his head of Research and Development, who goes by only his initial, B. “He’s head and shoulders above the others when it comes to this stuff,” Santa says proudly. B works a year in advance, so when the other E.L.V.E.S. are making toys for this holiday season, B is hard at work discovering what next year’s hottest requests will be. “If we’re going to start making these in June, we have to know now what raw materials to order,” B explains. He keeps tabs on the trends by using Web Clipper . “I just love it that my job is grabbing pictures of upcoming movies, TV shows, and games,” he grins. As Santa shuttles me out of R&D, he explains that our visit is over. “We’re very busy,” he apologizes. He looks across the darkened horizon. “Winter is coming.” I turn before I leave to take one last look at the Workshop. Santa is pleased. As I go, I can see him sipping his cocoa, and I hear him exclaim, “I love this place.” Whatever, however, and wherever you celebrate, happy holidays from all of us at Evernote.", "date": "2017-12-7,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The 12 Best Productivity Books of 2017", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/12-best-productivity-books-of-2017/", "abstract": "There’s never a bad time to consider how you can raise your productivity level and improve your life, but the end of the year presents a natural opportunity to reflect on your progress over the previous year. It’s a chance to adjust your sails and refocus, to lead you to even greater success in the year to come. Evernote’s goal is to help you to become your most productive self. Along with building a product that empowers you to take control of your life, we aim to share actionable tips and wisdom from the world’s foremost performance experts to help you achieve more. Here, then, is our list of the 12 best productivity books published in 2017. Each is filled with practical life-changing advice and will be a valuable reference for you in the coming year. Finish: Give Yourself the Gift of Done by Jon Acuff (Portfolio) As Acuff says, “The first few steps are critical, but they are not the most important. Do you know what matters more and makes the start look almost silly and easy and almost insignificant? The finish.” For many of us, starting a big project is not the problem; finishing it is. In this book, Acuff takes a look at what causes us to adopt self-defeating strategies, and provides simple tools for overcoming the obstacles we place in front of ourselves. The Happiness Hack: How to Take Charge of Your Brain and Program More Happiness into Your Life by Ellen Petry Leanse (Simple Truths) Evolution has wired our brains to focus on completing many small, measurable tasks over the course of the day. But, in modern society, that same focus can lead to an obsession with technology and a need to ‘do it all.’ This book is an engaging crash course in neuroscience, with a little Buddhism and mindfulness thrown in. Leanse shows how you can “hack” your mind to create real connections, reduce stress, and find more time to do the things you love. Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked by Adam Alter (Penguin Press) Where is your cell phone right now? Most likely it’s within arm’s reach. With the rise of social media and mobile content, we have become a generation of addicts, unwilling or unable to resist the temptation to stay connected. Alter looks at the causes of this obsession and the industry that relies upon it for survival. As Arianna Huffington says , Irresistible is “an important, groundbreaking book about why we’re addicted to technology, how we got here, and what we should do next.” Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam Grant (Penguin Books) History’s most groundbreaking achievements—whether in science, technology, or the arts—have almost always come from people who challenged accepted knowledge by ‘thinking outside the box.’ In this book, Grant looks at how “originals” have changed the world, and how we can apply some of their thinking patterns to our own work and lives. Originals covers how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt. Peak Performance: Elevate Your Game, Avoid Burnout, and Thrive with the New Science of Success by Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness (Rodale Books) In almost every high achiever—whether qualifying for the Olympics, breaking ground in mathematical theory, or crafting an artistic masterpiece—there are certain commonalities, personality traits that they have harnessed to enable them to reach their goals. In revealing the science of optimal performance and the stories of great performers across a wide range of capabilities, Peak Performance uncovers the secrets of success and coaches readers on how to use them. Principles: Life and Work by Ray Dalio (Simon & Schuster) As the founder of Bridgewater Associates, Dalio has earned himself a place on Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture. In Principles , Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. It’s a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve. The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact by Chip Heath and Dan Heath (Simon & Schuster) What if a teacher could design a lesson that students would remember twenty years later? What if you had a better sense of how to create memories that matter for your children? Many of the defining moments in our lives are the result of accident or luck—but why would we leave our most meaningful, memorable moments to chance when we can create them? The Power of Moments shows us how to be the author of richer experiences. The Productivity Project: Accomplishing More by Managing Your Time, Attention, and Energy by Chris Bailey (Crown Business) Chris Bailey devoted an entire year to performing a series of productivity experiments—using himself as the subject—in an attempt to uncover the secret to high achievement. Along the way, he made a number of surprising discoveries, including why you should strive for imperfection, schedule less time for important tasks, and embrace the concept of productive procrastination. In this book, Bailey presents his counterintuitive results and over 25 best practices that will help you accomplish more. Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity by Kim Scott (St. Martin’s Press) Too many managers either fail to tell their direct reports when their performance is lacking, or say it in destructive ways. In Radical Candor, Scott argues that these approaches do employees a disservice by not giving them the opportunity to course correct. Scott instead advocates for “radical candor,” which she defines as “Care Personally and Challenge Directly.” See real-life examples of what to do (and what not to do), as well as practical tips for becoming a better manager. Smarter Faster Better: The Transformative Power of Real Productivity by Charles Duhigg (Random House Trade Paperbacks) We all have the same 24 hours in each day, so why do some people and companies seem to get so much more done? Consistently high achievers don’t merely act differently, they view the world, and their choices, in profoundly different ways. In Smarter Faster Better, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Charles Duhigg explores the science of productivity, and why managing how you think is more important than what you think. The Spark and the Grind: Ignite the Power of Disciplined Creativity by Erik Wahl (Portfolio) We’ve been conditioned to think about creative genius as a dichotomy: dreamers versus doers, creativity versus discipline. What if it’s both? As Wahl says, “The world needs people who enjoy swimming in ideas until they discover a great one. The world also needs doers who have a gift for activation, a.k.a. “getting s*** done.” But the most potent individual creators in any industry or environment have learned how to be both. They’ve learned how to spark their grind and they’ve learned how to grind their sparks. As a result, they not only make things happen, they make great things.” This book offers surprising insights and practical advice about how to fan the sparks and make the grind more productive. Tribe of Mentors: Short Life Advice from the Best in the World by Tim Ferriss (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) New York Times best-selling author Tim Ferriss shares the ultimate ‘choose your own adventure’ book—a compilation of tools, tactics, and habits from over 130 of the world’s top performers. From iconic entrepreneurs to elite athletes, from artists to billionaire investors, these short profiles can help you answer life’s most challenging questions, achieve extraordinary results, and transform your life.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "See Your Evernote Like Never Before With Home", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/see-evernote-like-never-before-with-home/", "abstract": "UPDATED APRIL 2021: Home is now available on mobile! Look out for it on your iOS or Android (OS 10 and up) device in the next few weeks. When we began rolling out the new Evernote in September, we promised that this was not the end of the journey, but the start . We made a commitment to you that our new code base, rebuilt from the ground up to be more stable and reliable, was “laying the groundwork for new features and faster innovation in the future.” Today, as we kick off 2021, we’re proud to unveil Home , the first in a series of powerful new features being introduced this year.  Home is a brand-new way to start your day in Evernote; a one-stop dashboard that puts the information you need front and center—neatly organized and instantly available—so you can stay on top of your day without feeling overwhelmed. It’s rolling out to Mac, Windows, and Evernote Web customers over the next few weeks, with iOS and Android to follow. See what you need (and nothing more) Home gives you instant access to your most relevant content. Your important notes, tags, and shortcuts are ready and waiting when you open Evernote, making Home the fastest way to get to the things that matter to you. And since there’s more than one way to organize your content, Home gives you the freedom to shape your Evernote experience and see the information you want, the way you want it. Evernote Basic and Plus customers will see three default widgets when they open Home: Notes Select “Recent” notes to quickly pick up where you left off with any project; or choose “Suggested” notes and let Evernote surface the content you need—even if you haven’t touched it in a while. Scratch Pad No need to stop what you’re doing to capture a fleeting thought; stay in the zone by jotting it down on your scratch pad before you forget it. You can leave it there forever, erase it, or convert it to a note at any time. Recently Captured Since you probably do more than just write notes, this widget shows you all the rich content you’ve recently captured in your Evernote account. Now you can cut the clutter and go straight to your most recent: Web clips Images Documents (including PDFs and Microsoft Office docs) Audio Emails In addition to these widgets, Evernote Premium and Business customers will also have access to the following: Notebooks Similar to the notes widget, you can find clarity by choosing to view either your recently used notebooks, or the notebooks Evernote thinks you’ll find most relevant. Pinned Note Is there a note you use every day? Perhaps a to-do list or contact list? No need to search for it every time; pin it in Home instead, so it’s always at your fingertips. You can view it right from your Home dashboard or easily open it in the editor to make changes. Tags If tags are your favorite way to organize in Evernote, you’ll love this widget that shows your most frequently used tags in one convenient place, so you don’t need to switch screens to find them. Shortcuts Maybe you prefer to tame your Evernote content using shortcuts. This widget shows your favorite shortcuts right from your Home dashboard. Just click on a shortcut to instantly open that note or notebook. Together, these widgets are a powerful new way to see your content and manage it all. But Home’s real superpower lies in its flexibility. If you’re an Evernote Premium or Business customer, you can reorder or remove widgets to customize your Home, and resize them on desktop; you can also change your Home background image to match your mood and fit your personal style. Choose from one of our pre-loaded gallery of pictures (all taken by Evernote team members to be shared with you), or upload your own—it’s up to you. Because your Evernote should look the way you want and work the way you think. Not a Premium or Business customer yet? No problem. You can get a free trial of Evernote Premium to explore the full range of Home features. Looking ahead For those of you who caught wind of our unintentional sneak peek in December, we’re happy to finally bring you Home. And for all our Evernote family, we want to say: This is just the start . Over time, we’ll be making these widgets more powerful, more flexible, and more helpful, adapting them to the wide variety of uses you rely on to manage your busy life. We’ll also be introducing additional widgets that reach deeper into your Evernote and explore new capabilities, making Home the perfect place to start your day. But for now…Welcome Home!", "date": "2021-01-13,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Home: Feedback and Insights for Evernote’s Latest Feature", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-customers-home/", "abstract": "UPDATED April 2021 : Home is now available on mobile! Look out for it on your iOS or Android device in the next few weeks. It’s now been just over a month since we released the latest Evernote feature , Home , in our new apps for Mac, Windows, and web. Since then, we’ve heard from you about what you love, how you’re using Home, and what you’re excited to see in the future. So, we thought we’d share. The reaction to Home has been overwhelmingly positive. We’re delighted to see our customers describe Home as “love at first sight,” “a game changer,” and “very useful,” and tell us that this first release of 2021 shows Evernote is “going in the right direction.” LifeWire , Engadget , and TechRadar (among others) have all spoken favorably of their first impressions, as have influencers such as Carl Pullein and Keep Productive’s Francesco D’Alessio . But what’s important isn’t how much praise a feature gets, it’s how you use it. More than half of the Evernote customers who’ve seen Home have taken it for a spin. Not just looked at it, but poked around, tested it out, and explored how it fits into their workflow . This confirms something we’ve long known: that you’re not just looking for a place to store your ideas and information, but also for new ways to organize them intuitively, access them faster, and put them to work so you can get more done. The most popular Home widgets have, unsurprisingly, turned out to be the notes and notebooks widgets—unsurprising because, right from the start, these have been the basic building blocks of Evernote. But we’re also witnessing strong popularity for the scratch pad . Like a memo pad next to the phone, this widget is perfect for capturing fleeting thoughts—in the moment, before you forget them. You can leave them there forever or convert them into a note at any time. Where we have been surprised is at the level of customization from our Premium and Business customers . Although Home gives them the freedom to add or remove widgets , resize widgets on desktop , and change their background image , so far the default arrangement appears to meet most customers’ needs. The most common customizations are to move shortcuts and notebooks higher up the screen—an important indicator of which features they rely on most. And one in ten Premium customers has selected a new background from Home’s pre-loaded gallery of images—all of which were made by Evernote team members especially for you. Even though Home is available now on all your devices, our work hasn’t finished—in fact, it’s only just begun. We’re reading your comments and listening to your requests, and we’re working hard to make Home even better for you. We’re working on some of your top feature requests—like more widgets, more versatility, and more ways to personalize the information you see in Home. If you haven’t tried Home for yourself, download the latest version of Evernote to get started today!", "date": "2021-02-23,"},

As we continue to face the COVID-19 pandemic, my heart goes out to everyone who has lost loved ones to this horrible disease. I also want to express my sincere appreciation to everyone who is helping the world to fight back against this invisible enemy, often putting themselves at great risk. Like every other company, Evernote has also had to face unexpected challenges and risks. We have always had a distributed team, with people spread across seven offices in the United States and around the world. But we’ve had to transform into a 100 percent work-from-home company, virtually overnight. We’re far from alone in this, and I recognize how fortunate we are to transition at all when so many other businesses cannot. Still, it’s an enormous change. There’s a learning curve to ensuring that our employees remain connected to each other and connected to their own well-being, all while successfully collaborating to make progress against our company goals and our commitments to you. Many of you have asked where we stand regarding those goals, and when you can expect to see our new client apps in your hands. The good news is that we’ve made substantial progress on the foundations of Evernote. Although much of that progress is below the surface, it sets us up for faster innovation in the future. And while the apps themselves are taking much longer to deliver than we expected, we are making material progress toward release with each passing week, all with a goal of bringing you a more consistent, coherent Evernote. We are currently distributing Preview releases on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac every two weeks to a population of 20,000 volunteer testers in six languages, with more on the way. In Evernote parlance, a “Preview” is a customer-facing release stage that comes before Beta. This means that versions of our new apps are out in the wild right now. As Preview releases, these apps still have gaps in functionality, design, or performance, but every two weeks, they get better. They become more complete. Their performance improves (we are currently evaluating performance for our Windows and Mac builds with 50,000 note test accounts). These are necessary ingredients in getting to a more widespread Beta release, and ultimately to a production release that goes out to all of our customers. We have also made progress in the cloud. These changes are less visible, but Evernote’s foundation matters just as much as the apps we build upon it. In one of our Behind the Scenes videos , I talked about our successful migration of billions of notes from legacy storage to horizontally scalable cloud storage. This migration happened silently, while you were using the service , and without anyone noticing. In the last couple of months, we have repeated that success. This time, we successfully migrated all the permissions metadata which describes who owns each note and notebook, and who has access rights to shared notes, notebooks, and spaces. Again, we achieved this migration while millions of users were using the service every day, once again with no one noticing. Changes in the cloud are not immediately obvious to an end user, but they matter, and the benefits accumulate. This migration represented another major building block in transforming our infrastructure into a more modern, reliable, and scalable framework—a necessary step for us to deliver our new clients and innovate at a faster pace. Evernote may look simple on the outside, but it’s incredibly difficult to renovate a service with this much scale and complexity from the ground up. Because it’s not just about creating and editing notes. It’s about millions of people who use Evernote every day, with an incredible number of unique use cases. We have to discover, understand, and account for as many as possible. We do this to minimize risk and make sure future versions of Evernote delight you rather than frustrate you. Frankly, renovating at this scale is something that few companies are willing to tackle, because it’s just so hard to do. We experience how hard it is every time we uncover another unplanned challenge or unexpectedly complex edge case. You’re experiencing how hard it is in how long it’s taking us to get there: longer than we thought, longer than we’d like, and longer than you should have to wait. Making progress only gets harder amidst a global pandemic. But know this: We have not lost our focus. We remain resolute in our pursuit of building an ever better Evernote for you—something that we’re proud to stand behind, and that you can fall in love with all over again as you carry it throughout your work, your personal projects, and your life. Whether it’s from our kitchen tables, our living room couches, or our front porches, we are working hard and will keep driving forward for you. Every time we release a new internal build, or a new Preview goes out to our testers, the excitement is palpable. We’ll be incredibly pleased when they prove worthy of promotion to Beta. And when we get them into your hands in a general release, we will all breathe a sigh of relief—and immediately start working to deliver what comes next. Building a better Evernote isn’t easy. I appreciate your sticking with us as we climb this mountain together. And I look forward to all of us enjoying the view from the other side.", "date": "2020-05-26,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "State of the Product", "author": ["Ian Small"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/state-of-the-product/", "abstract": "It has been three months since my last update in this space, and Evernote has been extraordinarily busy. In September, we were just beginning to roll out our new apps. Now, as we head into the holidays, it’s time to report on the product transition we’re navigating, and to step back for a clear-eyed accounting of our efforts—one that reflects what we’re seeing in product usage as well as what we’re hearing from you. We have released new apps for all of our core platforms: Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android. Android was the last to release, beginning its rollout on December 1, limited at this point to devices running Android 10 or newer. We expect to broaden OS version support in the early months of 2021; until then, older Android devices will continue to use the previous generation Evernote app. While we have made considerable progress in our new apps, rebuilding them from the ground up, the releases have not gone as smoothly as any of us would have liked. Despite an extensive QA process and a long-running beta program, some of our customers have encountered frustrating bugs and performance issues. In the earliest versions of our releases, for example, some customers saw their notes repeatedly duplicated while they were editing them. Bugs with our iOS share extension tool made clipping content problematic, and the speed and reliability of downloading notes for offline use didn’t deliver on your expectations. Likewise, early versions of our Mac and Windows apps exhibited problems with note links, and provided inconsistent access to keyboard shortcuts. Our most advanced power users were quick to report previously unknown bugs, including reports of sporadic sync and performance issues. We moved quickly to fix many of these issues, and we continue to make significant progress with each release, but we recognize that encountering bugs like these is frustrating. Beyond the bugs, some of our UX and functionality decisions spurred complaints from long-time customers while earning praise from others. Some friction was an unavoidable by-product of our decision to more closely align our design across platforms. As I’ve mentioned in our Behind the Scenes videos , Evernote had evolved into five divergent experiences on five different platforms. To reunify the apps and give you a more seamless experience across devices, we had to make hundreds of individual choices about the UX and functionality that formed the basis for the new Evernote. We considered each of these decisions carefully because they meant making tradeoffs—tradeoffs that had the potential to improve some workflows, while disrupting others. But possibly more controversial was our decision to roll out the new Mac and Windows apps while still missing features used by some of our most intensive customers. We believed this was the right path because Mac and Windows users dependent on missing features could continue to use (and reinstall if necessary) their legacy Evernote Mac or Windows client . Meanwhile, getting the new apps into people’s hands now—even if they only met the needs of 90 percent of our customers—opened up our ability to iterate quickly, so we could work through the backlog of rebuilding previously available features and make progress on new features to come. In retrospect, I think we went wrong in failing to set proper expectations with our power users in advance of these releases. If we had increased communication to help our most intensive users evaluate up front whether the new Windows or Mac release was ready for them, I believe we could have avoided much of the dislocation they experienced on exploring the new apps. Nonetheless, launching the new clients into market has enabled us to increase release velocity significantly over the last several months, so we still believe that we are on the right path. With all that said, I want to be clear about where we stand. We are now shipping software faster than we have in years. Software velocity was one of the underlying reasons that we undertook this top-to-bottom renovation of our applications and infrastructure. Since our first iOS release in September, we have shipped six follow-up releases, addressing bugs and performance issues as well as filling feature gaps that include sort options in search results, adding tags via share extension, printing notes, and the ability to view password-protected PDFs. On Windows and Mac, we have shipped nine releases and started to close the feature gap by adding the ability to edit note creation dates, top list view, dark mode improvements, note counts in the left nav, and the ability to make quick notes and take screen captures with Evernote Helper. We’ve recognized the need to increase transparency, so you can see what’s slated for upcoming releases in the “Coming Soon” section of the release notes . We are prioritizing sync and performance issues. Evernote’s promise to help you “remember everything and accomplish anything” depends on error-free sync and speedy performance. When sync goes wrong or performance is lacking, we’re not succeeding. As we plan releases in our newly accelerated release cycle, addressing these problems comes first. Every release since launch has contained fixes and improvements for sync and/or performance, and we will continue to maintain this focus. We are listening to and acting on your feedback. Working at the scale of millions of customers is challenging; virtually any decision will leave some people feeling elated and others displeased. Fortunately, we have a passionate user base that has taken the time to explain in detail how changes we’ve made impact their diverse approaches to Evernote. If we get something wrong, that feedback can help us reassess. For instance, we recently restored the ability for users to choose between internal and external link formats when copying a note link. In upcoming releases, we will restore a full slate of keyboard shortcuts (and add a matching quick reference guide), move the insert menu to be more easily within reach for large screens, and change links in notes to require only a single click. We will balance filling in the backlog with shipping new functionality. Users who have reverted to the legacy Mac or Windows versions of Evernote want us to fill the gap of missing features. On the other hand, the majority of Evernote’s customers are looking forward to new capabilities. Both needs are real, so expect us to pursue both in parallel, taking advantage of our new, higher velocity release cycle. At the same time as we are working through the feature backlog, you will see us start to beta and ship completely new functionality across our new apps. We’ve already shipped Google Drive integration on iOS, and some weeks back, we started a private beta of a significant new feature, with even more new functionality already in the pipe. We remain committed to making Evernote ever better for our customers. It is clear that we still have work to do before our new apps will delight everyone. But it is also true that many of our customers are already finding great success with these apps, as we can see in improved product engagement metrics measured across millions of users. For instance, across the new apps customers are creating more notes and are more likely to share or tag notes than they are in the legacy clients. So while our work is not done, our direction is clear. We believe that every few weeks, with every release, we have the opportunity to demonstrate why we undertook this journey two years ago. With every release, we are knocking down issues and building momentum. With every release, we will regain the trust of those who have run into problems, and advance towards our goal of delighting you all with exciting new capabilities. I’m confident that the first few months of 2021 will be an exciting start to an exciting, productive year with Evernote.", "date": "2020-12-10,"},

We abhor the senseless violence and hostility that so many black and brown people face every day and have faced for generations. In this time we are all called upon to declare what we stand for, and what we intend to do about it. At Evernote, we stand against racism, racial inequality, and injustice, in all its overt and hidden forms. We believe Black Lives Matter. And we believe making a better world is everyone’s responsibility. Many companies have taken public stances supporting Black Lives Matter in recent weeks. Until now we’ve been quiet in public. But within Evernote, our conversations have been many, often deep, and sometimes painful. Our focus has been on supporting our employees right now and finding a path forward together. Our dialogue began with an email I wrote to the company on June 1. In it, I said: There is absolutely no place for racism and violence . As an Evernote family, we must stand united and supportive around this simple truth. I hope that in our journey together, we’ve cultivated an environment of trust, transparency and a willingness to hear hard truths. We’ve proven that as individuals and as a team, we’re willing to confront impossible problems. That’s good, because this is a problem that needs all of us. Yet we know talking is not enough. Standing on the sidelines is not enough. To create lasting change, we must do more. We must amplify voices that have gone unheard for too long, and we must step up. Over the past two weeks, we’ve begun exploring ways to take meaningful action as individuals and as a company. As a first step, many of us have lent personal support to a variety of organizations and initiatives working to end systemic injustice and inequality, including Black Lives Matter , Equal Justice Institute , NAACP and Southern Poverty Law Center . Evernote is not a vast organization, but our operations span four major urban centers in the U.S., and others around the world. As a next step, we are working across the company to identify and prioritize actions that can have the greatest impact in our local communities, and within our own walls. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once told the students of Oberlin College, “the time is always right to do what’s right.” At Evernote, we commit to turning words into action so we can all look forward to greater progress as a society.", "date": "2020-06-12,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How To Stay Disciplined When Times Are Tough", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/discipline-when-times-are-tough/", "abstract": "“May you live in interesting times.” It’s a saying that’s been quoted by everyone from Arthur C. Clarke to Hillary Clinton , and while we might not be sure of its provenance, we all understand that it’s a curse, not a blessing. Its lesson is that upheaval, conflict, and change in our lives can consume so much of our mental and emotional reserves that it can become impossible to focus on anything else. With that in mind, this year certainly has been… interesting. Perhaps you set goals for 2020 way back in January; you may have even created a plan for achieving them. But then (*waves arms around*) all this happened, and your plans fell by the wayside. Now you’re left thinking about what could have been— should have been—and wondering how you’ll ever reach those goals. The good news is that it’s not too late. Despite all the disruption this year has brought, each new day is an opportunity to reset your outlook, recalibrate your aim, and try again. But (and here’s the important bit) in order to succeed, something needs to change. Along with creating a plan for what you want to achieve, there’s one vitally important skill you need to master: self-discipline . Then, when unexpected events occur (as they surely will), you’ll have the strength to resist temptation and stay laser-focused on your goals—no matter what life throws at you. What is self-discipline? And why is it important? Simply put, self-discipline is doing what you need to do, when you need to do it, whether you want to or not. Self-discipline is the voice in your head that wakes you up at 5 a.m. to go to the gym, when all you want to do is roll over and go back to sleep. It’s the voice that pushes you to keep striving (whether your goal is to be a better artist, athlete, entrepreneur, or friend) when you’d rather binge-watch the latest Netflix hit. Without self-discipline, your goals are at the mercy of your circumstances. If things go well, you may still reach them; but at the first sign of friction, you’ll quit. As author Jim Rohn said, “Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishments.” It’s the path that leads you from where you are to where you want to be. Is self-discipline the same as willpower? Self-discipline and willpower (or self- control) sound like the same thing. They both require sacrifice and determination—and they’re both really hard to do! But there’s a key difference: Willpower is sudden and immediate; it’s saying no to that piece of cake when someone offers it to you. Self-discipline, on the other hand, is a conscious, long-term decision to do what you’ve committed to doing, without allowing yourself to be distracted. Willpower is about controlling your impulses and desires, and saying “no” to temptation. Self-discipline is about continual improvement; training yourself to be better today than you were yesterday. So while willpower may be great (even necessary) for reaching short-term goals, self-discipline is the engine that will power your life and lead to long-term success . Think of them as two complementary forces, where willpower is self-discipline in action. How to build self-discipline in your life Let’s not mince words: It takes time and commitment to build self-discipline into your life, and you’ll inevitably encounter setbacks. But as Eleanor Roosevelt said, “I am who I am today because of the choices I made yesterday.” Here are three tips for self-discipline training that’ll help you stay strong, and turn you into a goal-crushing machine: Capture and commit We’ve written about this before , but it’s worth repeating: Once you’ve decided on a goal, write it down . Dr. Gail Matthews of Dominican University of California found that simply writing down a goal increases your likelihood of achieving it by 42 percent. It makes sense. If you set out to drive across the country without a map, you’ll arrive somewhere, but there’s a very good chance it won’t be where you expected, and you’ll waste time and precious energy in the process. It’s the same with your goals: Without a plan, who knows where you’ll end up? Next, ask yourself: Am I chasing what I really want in life, or merely what I “should” want? If you don’t have a burning desire to achieve your goal, you won’t muster the self-discipline to keep going when things get tough. Any goal you choose must spark something in you that can’t be extinguished; something that refuses to take “no” for an answer. Take action: Create a note in Evernote and add a checklist to build an action plan for each goal. Use Web Clipper to capture anything from the web that helps you visualize the achievement of your goal. This will keep you inspired when things get rough. Review your goals everyday to make sure you’re staying on track and that they still align with your true desires. Understand your strengths… AND weaknesses Do you jump out of bed in the morning, full of energy and ready to take on the day? Or are you more of a “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had three cups of coffee” kind of person? Either one is fine (really!), but understanding yourself , and planning your day to fit your style, is vital to achieving success. Try to schedule any ‘ deep work ’ for times when you know you’re generally more focused, and leave the other times for mundane tasks. Likewise, you may have a weakness for social media (hey, we’re not judging). In their book, “Make Time,” Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky, the “Time Dorks,” call these “Infinity Loops” because they’re never-ending. You can scroll on and on forever, and while that might be a fun way to pass the time, it can easily derail your plans. Instead, recognize your weak spot so it’s easier to catch yourself in the act and get back on track—before you spend half a day going nowhere! On the flip side, you may be great at focusing on a single task once you finally get started. Use that to your advantage! Put your phone out of sight, clear off your desk, and set the stage for some good, focused work. What these tips all have in common is raising your awareness of who you are. Once you have a deeper understanding of where you perform best and where you may need a little help, you can play to your strengths and minimize your weaknesses. Take action : Use Evernote’s Daily Focus and Energy Tracker to help you identify your most productive times, and plan your day accordingly. Track, reflect, and correct Now that you have a goal, and understand yourself well enough to work toward it effectively, there’s nothing standing in your way, right? Surely, achieving the goal will take care of itself. Not quite. Life isn’t always as smooth as we’d like (hello, 2020!), so you need to be adaptable and open to the possibility that you’ll need to adjust your plan. Unexpected complications can arise, timeframes can shift, so no matter how well you’ve planned, you may need to make changes in order to stay aimed at your target. That’s why it’s vital to know where you stand as you progress along the road. Schedule time every week to review your plans and track the progress you’ve made toward your goals. The most important thing is to be honest with yourself. This means acknowledging your struggles as well as your successes, reflecting on what you could have done differently, and formulating strategies for doing better next time. Finally, a quick word on ‘failure’: It’s easy to get discouraged when you mess up, but don’t let that be an excuse to quit. The fact that you tried is a victory. You’ve taken more steps toward your goals than most people ever will, and learned something in the process: what doesn’t work. Take that information, make changes where you need to, and keep trying until you succeed. Because the only thing that hurts more than failing is quitting. Take action : Use Evernote’s Weekly Review template to track your progress and make sure you’re still heading the right direction. If this year has taught us anything, it’s that no matter how diligently you plan for the future, you really don’t know what that future has planned for you. But as long as you keep an eye on your ultimate goal, and be ready to adjust course if necessary, you can handle whatever comes your way and reach your destination. A little battered and bruised perhaps, but where you always intended to be.", "date": "2020-10-19,"},

But sometimes, little changes can make a big difference, too. Our new release of Evernote 10.6 on iOS and Android (OS 10 and up)—expected to roll out over the next two weeks—is an example of just that. Because table editing in Evernote for iOS and Android is here. For the first time, you can create, edit, and manage tables on mobile devices just like you can with Evernote for Mac, Windows, and web. Insert and delete columns and rows right from your smartphone or tablet, and merge cells within your table. Change how table cell contents are aligned, and even experiment with different cell background colors! This is a capability that our customers have been asking for since the early days of Evernote on iPhone. You’ve always been able to edit the contents of tables on your phone or tablet, but it’s reasonable to expect the mobile experience to be similar to what you’ve long enjoyed on desktop. We heard you! With Evernote 10.6, we’ve brought table editing on mobile to parity with desktop devices. And not just that: Looking across the competitive landscape, we are confident that these new table editing capabilities are best-in-class for mobile. This is all possible because of the investments we’ve made in our new clients over the last two years. We promised at the time that those investments would accelerate our ability to ship software and would bring a new era of innovation in Evernote. That includes big new features like Home on Mac, Windows, and web , which we introduced in January. But it also means small improvements that make Evernote better on the devices you use every day, like table editing on iOS and Android. We have much still to do across the board—bugs to fix, performance to tune, legacy backlog to catch up. Today brings more progress in the form of another software release, this time with table editing on mobile. We hope you take some time to explore this new feature and see what you can do with it. In the meantime, we’ll keep the improvements coming as, together, we build an ever better Evernote.", "date": "2021-03-9,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Work From (Almost) Anywhere: How Evernote Has Embraced the Future of Remote Work", "author": ["Susan Stick"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-future-remote-work/", "abstract": "As a member of our Evernote community, you’ve seen us share plenty of “ behind the scenes ” updates. Usually they’re focused on the product—improvements we’ve made and new features we’ve added. Today, we’d like to do something different and focus on our people— how the past year has affected them and how we as a company have adapted to change. Consider it a behind the behind the scenes, if you will. How it started Like so many companies around the world, Evernote sent all of its employees home in March 2020 and, more than a year later, the Notable Herd (as we affectionately call ourselves) is still working from home. By and large, it’s going well. We’ve released new clients for Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android; brand-new features such as Home ; and we’re continuing to work on the next generation of Evernote apps—all while 100% remote. This leap into the unknown has been so successful, in fact, that we’ve decided to embrace—permanently—parts of the remote work experience that have proven effective for us. How it’s going As the weeks of pandemic lockdown turned into months, some of the Herd told us they were interested in relocating to other parts of the country. For some, it meant the opportunity to move closer to extended families—for help with childcare or to care for a loved one. For others, it enabled them to enjoy a lower cost of living, or simply a change of pace. Rather than discourage this, we understood and supported their desire for more flexibility. Now, with more than a year of experience, we can see the many benefits of remote work, even in a post-pandemic world. That’s why we’ve decided to embrace the change with these initiatives: Work from (Almost) Anywhere Work from (Almost) Anywhere is a new Evernote program where U.S. employees can opt to work from just about anywhere in the country, whether or not we have a physical office nearby. Not only does this give current employees the freedom to continue their careers with Evernote independently of where they choose to live, it allows us to recruit the best candidates for any role from anywhere. Right now, we have 30 positions we’re actively looking to fill , including 20 in Engineering. Work from (Almost) Anywhere opens up the hiring pool, giving us a better chance of finding exactly the right person for each one. For now, this program is only available in the U.S., but we’ll soon roll out a similar program for our Chile-based Herd. Working from our offices We’ve also learned that remote work isn’t for everyone. While many companies are ditching offices entirely, we’ve made clear to our teams that Evernote is not going “full remote.” We’ll continue to maintain offices in the places where we do now—the San Francisco Bay Area, Austin, San Diego, Bothell, Santiago, Viña del Mar, Tokyo, and Delhi—and we’re looking forward to opening them all as soon as conditions make it safe to do so. Over time, our offices will likely change to adapt to the way that our teams are using them—to keep everyone safe, to better accommodate collaboration between in-office and remote employees, and to include more flexible spaces for working and socializing. But the option to work in an office setting will always be there for those who want it. Like our mascot, Mads the elephant, the Notable Herd is a close and very social group! Flexible Remote Some of us want it all, and the post-pandemic office version of that is what we at Evernote call Flexible Remote. Flexible Remote allows members of the Herd to split their time between in-office and working from home, to get the benefits of both. We’ve always enjoyed a fair amount of flexibility to work remotely, but now we’ve made it official: at Evernote, you can set the in-office schedule that works for you. We invited Evernote employees to create their own versions of the “How it started/How it’s going” meme. Doubling down on wellness While the Herd transitioned to remote work with remarkable agility, we know that the last year (and then some) hasn’t been easy. While Evernote has always emphasized the health and welfare of our employees, we’ve expanded our wellness programs during remote work and will continue them in a post-pandemic world. Over the last year, we launched Wellness Weekends, where the entire company enjoys a 3- or 4-day weekend, to rest and recharge, and added mental health benefits such as coaches and therapists for our employees and their families. We’ve also continued our most popular programs, like a $1,000 annual vacation stipend that actually pays people to not come to work, and our Wellness Reimbursement program, where every employee can spend up to $1,200 a year on their own health and wellness. What comes next? The last year has been, among other things, a massive unplanned experiment in remote work, and the programs we’ve described here were borne out of that experience. We see them as first steps in what is likely to be a significant evolution in the post-pandemic workplace, and we know that we have more work to do. For example, one reason the last year went as well as it did for our teams is likely because the entire Notable Herd (and a lot of the world around us) was all working remotely at the same time. We’ll need behaviors and tools that allow us to continue working well together when some of us are in an office and others are remote, to name just one ongoing challenge. But, much like Evernote the product, Evernote the company will continue to grow and change to meet the world around us. We’re grateful for the resilience of the Notable Herd, and to have you, our community of users, with us on this journey. It’s been a challenging year, but we’re committed to growth and we know that brighter days lay ahead. We’re proud of our people, and invite you to consider joining the Notable Herd and bringing your skills to Evernote. In addition to the programs above, Evernote offers generous benefits and great perks, all while working on a product that helps millions of people get more done every day.

You have your favorite features, your tried-and-true workflows. So when we released the first of our new apps last year, you may have wondered: Evernote’s apps may be new, but are they better than what I already have? Redesigning Evernote from the ground up was a massive undertaking, but it has given us more consistency and a new platform for innovation, allowing us to fix bugs and build features for you at a much faster pace. In fact, we released more updates in the first two months of 2021 than during the whole of 2020! So while the process is ongoing, we’ve been working hard to not only make the new apps worthy successors to the old ones, but to introduce new functionality as well. Of course, moving into the future means focusing our attention on the most recent version of Evernote, so head over to our download page now to make sure you’re taking advantage of all the latest improvements. New features to make your life easier As the next step in our evolution, Evernote now offers a number of brand-new features to help you feel more organized and stay on top of your day: Home on desktop and web The biggest addition to Evernote (for now!) is Home , a one-stop dashboard that puts the information you need front and center—neatly organized and instantly accessible to you. Home is a brand-new way to start your day in Evernote, making it more personal and easier to use. Home is available now for Mac, Windows, and web, and it’s coming very soon to iOS and Android. Check out our comprehensive video tutorial for an in-depth look: Edit tables on the go You’ve always been able to use your phone or tablet to edit the data inside a table; now you can change the look and feel of the tables themselves—just like you would on desktop. Insert and delete columns and rows, merge and unmerge cells, change how cell contents are aligned, and even change a cell’s background color. Now it’s easy to give structure to your information wherever you go. This helpful explainer video shows you how: Keyboard Shortcuts Menu There are over 100 keyboard shortcuts you can use to get things done quicker in Evernote for Mac and Windows—and we’re adding more all the time. There are even global shortcuts you can access while you’re in another app! See them all in one place in the new keyboard shortcuts menu by typing Cmd / (Command-Slash) on Mac or Ctrl / (Control-Slash) on Windows. They’re organized by function for easy navigation, and you can even change the keystroke combination for any global shortcut if, for example, it conflicts with another app. Check out this video to see it in action: Go dark on Windows Windows customers, rejoice! Give your eyes a rest with dark mode, now available for you in Evernote for Windows. Simply click View > Dark Mode from the menu bar, then choose a dark mode setting. Attach Google Drive files on the go Adding links to Google Drive files from your iOS or Android device is now as easy as if you were adding a photo. Once you’ve connected your Evernote and Google accounts, just tap the Insert button and select Google Drive to add a link to your note. Any links you insert will appear as rich links showing the title of your file, just like they do on desktop. Change the background color and pattern for sketches Let your creativity run wild! Now you can personalize your handwritten notes and sketches even further, by changing the background color and pattern. Existing features you rely on Shifting Evernote’s code base to a more modern, stable foundation has given us the opportunity to build new features to make your life easier, but it came with a cost: We’ve had to rebuild every existing feature to work with this new architecture. And while we tried to get as many legacy features as possible ready for you from day one, some inevitably took longer than we’d hoped. Still, we’re working through the backlog and, with each update, adding back more of the features you’ve asked for. Deciding what we include in an update is a careful balance between introducing features and fixing bugs, and ensuring the best possible experience for you, our customer. This article gives more information on our process and the different ways you can get updates. Here are a few legacy features we’ve recently added back into the app—hopefully, you’ll see your favorites among them! On desktop: Keyboard shortcuts… lots of them. Plus, you can now edit global keyboard shortcuts, including the paste function! We’re still working on the global shortcut for quickly switching to your content. Top List view. This completes the set which also includes Cards, Snippets, and Side List views. Evernote Helper . Create a quick note right from your computer’s menu bar, and (you’ll be glad to know) you can once again use it to take a screenshot! Spell check . Toggle it on or off, and add words to the app’s custom dictionary. Note create date . Yes, you can change the ‘create date’ of your notes. In case you wanted to know what time travel feels like.

And these are just the tip of the iceberg. To see exactly what’s been included with each update, check out our release notes archive for more detail. What’s next? One year ago, Evernote CEO Ian Small said , “[T]he ‘finish’ line to fixing the basics isn’t really a finish line at all. It’s the starting line of a new race: the race toward a whole new generation of innovation and improvement in the Evernote experience.” With that in mind, we plan on releasing even more new features this year, to help you remember everything and accomplish anything . At the same time, we will continue to update Evernote regularly, to reintroduce legacy features and “ to deliver an Evernote all of us can fall in love with all over again .” Thank you for your support and your patience as, together, we make Evernote #everbetter.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Redefine Success and Find Happiness in Your Life", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/redefine-success-find-happiness/", "abstract": "How are you feeling right now? Exhausted? Burned out? Struggling to cope? If so, you’re not alone. 2020 is a year most of us would like to forget, as COVID-19 has impacted every aspect of our lives. You may have entered this year with big goals (we did!), only to see them fall by the wayside as life took an unexpected turn. That’s frustrating, for sure. But try not to measure yourself against plans you made in ‘the before times,’ or compare your progress to that of others. Instead of beating yourself up for ‘failing,’ here’s a radical idea: you can redefine success. Perhaps you didn’t lose weight, quit smoking, or write that book; sometimes, simply getting to the end of the day in one piece is an accomplishment. It doesn’t mean giving up on your dreams; it means you’ll live to fight another day. Redefining success takes account of your changed circumstances and liberates you from the need to achieve it all now. A time to reflect “There can be no life without change, and to be afraid of what is different or unfamiliar is to be afraid of life.” Theodore Roosevelt We began this series of posts in January with a promise: We’d “help you build your own flexible toolkit for success, with a year-long series covering the essential building blocks of productivity.” Little did we know then what this year would bring. And so we’ve also had to redefine success—from helping you be more productive to helping you navigate uncharted territory. The end of the calendar year forms a natural opportunity to pause, reflect on what you’ve achieved, and set your goals and intentions for the coming year. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, there’s one last question you need to answer for 2020: After everything you’ve been through this year, what does success look like now? To help you answer that, we’d like to do our own reflecting and look back on the previous entries in this series, to see how you can apply them as you set your sights on 2021 and beyond. Each one holds a piece of the puzzle that, when completed, offers you everything you need to accomplish your goals. Here, then, are nine indispensable tools for success—however you choose to define it. Overcome your bad habits Millions of people say they want to improve some part of their lives , but research shows only eight percent will actually achieve their goal. The problem is that we are creatures of habit…literally. Psychologist Wendy Wood says , “When you repeat an action over and over again in a given context and then get a reward when you do that, you are learning very slowly and incrementally to associate that context with that behavior.” To break your bad habits , try these strategies instead: Identify your cues. Download Evernote’s Daily Recharge template and use it to record your emotions and reactions. You can also start a journal to keep track of your feelings, and work through any negative thoughts and emotions—without worrying about what anyone else might think. Increase the friction. Making it more difficult to indulge your bad habits makes it easier for you to eliminate them. For example, if you’re addicted to your smartphone, put it in a drawer when you’re not using it. Or create a shopping list in Evernote to avoid making impulse purchases of unhealthy items. Substitute good habits. As long as you continue to experience the same cues, your brain will react with the same old routines. Instead, create a table and add a row for each of the responses you want to change, then list the ‘good’ habits you’ve decided to replace them with. For example, next to “Eat a donut at 3 p.m.” you could write “Eat an apple.” Track your progress. Get Evernote’s Habit Tracker template to see how well you’re doing with your new habits—but don’t be too hard on yourself if you miss a day! Simply forgive yourself for being human and jump back in as soon as you can. Make a plan Creating a plan may seem like an inconvenience when you want your journey to a better life to begin now. But traversing new territory is easier when you have a map—whether that’s taking a vacation, earning a promotion, or starting a new business. Here’s how to create your own foundation for action : Write down your goal. Simply writing down a goal increases your likelihood of achieving it by 42 percent. You can capture it with Evernote’s Yearly Goals template, or if you prefer to use pen and paper, scan it into Evernote so you can refer back to it later. Divide your goals into chunks. Create a plan that divides your goal into small, incremental steps, then write down each step and set a deadline for its completion. Use Evernote’s Daily Planner and Weekly Planner , and create entries for every step you need to take—and don’t forget to reward yourself for the progress you make along the way! Review your plan daily. To stay on track, set a reminder to review your goal note regularly—daily if possible. It’s a great way to set your intention for the day and keep your focus where it belongs. Stay on target. As you complete each ‘chunk’ of your plan, take a moment to celebrate your progress and reevaluate your plan: Is it still practical? Are there any adjustments you need to make? That will help remind you of why you started in the first place, and give you a much-needed boost of energy. Stay focused In times of uncertainty (*gestures at everything*), the goal isn’t to match your peak productivity levels. Instead, it’s about finding pockets throughout the day that are more conducive to focusing, and gradually reducing distractions. Here are four ways to stay on task and get your work done : Train your mind to ignore distractions. When you need to focus for long periods of time, less is more. That’s the science behind The Pomodoro Technique , which recommends dividing your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. You can use this Evernote template to capture your Pomodoro tasks. Learn your ultradian rhythm. Within a 24-hour day, we cycle through 90-minute blocks of productivity and heightened focus, known as our ultradian rhythm. Use this Evernote template to track your levels of focus, enthusiasm, and energy, and save your most creative, strategic projects for when you feel most focused. Zone out. No, seriously. Giving yourself permission to daydream—at predetermined times— can be a surprisingly efficient productivity strategy. Schedule a time for deliberate mind wandering, then set a reminder in Evernote, but be sure to choose a window of time when your ultradian rhythm is not primed for focused effort. Choose the right location. If you don’t have a home office, contextual clues can make a shared space feel different. Take a picture or create a checklist of the items in your ‘work space.’ That’ll make it easier to get set up each day, and get down to work. Get organized Disorganization wastes time and money . The ultimate goal is to organize your life to help you find calm and think more clearly. While this will look different for everyone, you can experiment with different approaches to see what resonates with you: Create standard naming conventions for labels and digital files. This helps keep you and your digital workspace organized. Try using a special character or emoji at the start of your most important notes so they always appear at the top of your note list. Or, if sorting by date is helpful to you, use a YYYY-MM-DD date format so alphabetical order is the same as date order. Leverage automation to connect apps. Jumping between apps all day long not only impacts your productivity, it also increases the chances of losing information or having too much data siloed in certain apps. Tools like Zapier and IFTTT can help you connect your favorite apps, so information automatically flows between each one. Optimize your desk space. Identify the three to five items you use most regularly and keep only those things within reach. Or have your desk mirror our natural tendency for linear processing: Place ‘incoming items’ (like your computer or phone) on the left and ‘outgoing items’ (like completed paperwork, stamps, and staplers) on the right. Go paperless. Scanning paper files into Evernote is as simple as using your smartphone’s camera. While in the Evernote app, tap the camera icon and point your device at the item you want to scan . Make organization a habit. Make time for organization like you would for a meeting or big event. Block off ten minutes at the end of each day and set a reminder to clean up your digital and physical space, or leave an hour on Fridays to focus on organization. You can keep track of it using Evernote’s GTD Weekly Review Template . Find inspiration Steve Jobs once said , “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something.” Here are three steps to making those elusive connections and boosting your creativity: Train your brain in divergent thinking. This encourages spontaneous, free-flowing thinking that entertains multiple solutions to a problem. One way to develop the ability is with synectics exercises . To begin, choose any two things, like a lamp and box of tissues, and write down as many associations as you can think of. Repeat the exercise everyday with new items. Capture all your ideas. It’s important to capture everything, so you can graduate from making connections between two random objects to finding an inspired connection between two previously unrelated ideas. Start by creating an “Ideas” notebook in Evernote to capture all your ideas, then set aside a regular time to review them all. Introduce the unexpected. The more diverse your experiences are, the more likely you are to innovate. You can jump-start your creativity by reading history, starting a new hobby, listening to music, or talking to someone new. Save and annotate PDFs and other content in Evernote to keep track of your thoughts and reactions as you are exposed to the unexpected. Be open to possibilities While it’s important to focus, too much focus on one thing can cause a kind of mental tunnel vision, closing you off to new ideas. As a result, your work can begin to feel mundane and uninspired. Here are four strategies for breaking the monotony so you can be more open to inspiration: Invite something new. People tend to be more inspired when they’re open to new experiences . So it isn’t just a matter of stepping away from the problem at hand, it’s about stepping toward something outside your normal routine to purposefully clear your mind and make way for fresh ideas. Seek different perspectives. This isn’t about comparing yourself to anyone; it’s about seeking out quality content in your field that comes from different perspectives. Save anything that sparks an idea for one of your projects to Evernote, whether you’re on your computer or mobile device. Practice without pressure. Building your chops at whatever you want to accomplish is like laying the tracks for inspiration to come. To begin, check your calendar at the start of each work week and schedule at least 30 minutes of free time. Just like that, you have a sacred space in your week where you can refine your work-related skills. When inspiration comes, welcome it. If you’ve ever failed to capture a fleeting insight, don’t worry; it happens to the best of us. Instead, keep your tools for capturing unexpected brilliance always at the ready. Sync your Evernote account to all your devices and use shortcuts to keep the notes where you capture inspiration always at your fingertips. Capture your ideas Evernote’s founder Stepan Pachikov once said , “An interesting moment in life lasts only a moment.” The challenge is grabbing hold of those moments—those brilliant ideas—so they can live forever. To do that, you need a strategy for capturing them when inspiration strikes. Here’s how to get ideas out of your head and into a note: Quiet your doubts with freewriting. The goal of freewriting is simple: write without stopping. Choose a time limit, put your pen to paper or your hands on the keyboard, and don’t stop until the time is up. Create a dedicated note in Evernote that acts as a journal , where you can store all your freewriting. Dictate your ideas. If you’re feeling stuck capturing your creative ideas with a pen or keyboard, record yourself explaining them out loud. Record an audio note directly into Evernote, then add comments to it later. You can even use your device’s speech-to-text capabilities to transcribe your ideas. Draw a mind map. When a new idea is still just a seed, it’s impossible to focus on the specifics. Instead, capture that small spark—a single word or image—with the goal of jump-starting new streams of inspiration. Sketch a mind map directly in Evernote on your iPhone or iPad using your finger or a stylus. Create a space for collaboration. To begin, simply create a notebook in Evernote and click the Share button to invite your colleagues to contribute. The end result is a collaborative, multimedia representation of everyone’s ideas. They can save and annotate images and PDFs in Evernote, and use Web Clipper to capture inspiring web pages. Practice adaptability You can’t always know or control what tomorrow will bring, but you can control how you react to change. Will you flounder and drown, or will you find stable ground and take advantage of fresh opportunities? Your adaptability, along with the overlapping traits of resilience and emotional intelligence , may well tip the balance. Here are three sets of specific tools you can use right now to become more adaptable , and navigate even the scariest change: Follow the North Star. To become more adaptable, you need goals big enough to provide a True North in your life, and enough self-understanding to figure out where you stand in relation to those goals. Ask yourself: What is my personal or professional purpose? What makes me feel fulfilled as a human being? Which parts of me are so fundamental that external change can’t ruin them? Write your answers down and come back to them whenever you’re feeling anxious or adrift. Expand your comfort zone. Thankfully, you don’t have to choose between comfort and panic. There’s a third zone in between —the learning zone—where we become more adaptable. A commonplace book or spark file in Evernote can help you capture interesting ideas, articles, and images, and provide a bottomless source of inspiration. Learn from your mistakes (and your successes). This might sound like a ticket to low self-esteem, but a failure log is actually a powerful tool for growth . Look for the specific reasons things didn’t work out. Did you need more training? A better plan? More support from your colleagues? How can you better prepare for the next attempt? The takeaway is not that you screwed up, but that you can improve . Master self-discipline Despite all the disruption this year has brought, each new day is an opportunity to reset your outlook, recalibrate your aim, and try again. Along with creating a plan for what you want to achieve, there’s one vitally important skill you need to master: self-discipline . Then, when unexpected events occur (as they surely will), you’ll have the strength to resist temptation and stay laser-focused on your goals—no matter what life throws at you. Some of the tools you’ve already picked up on this journey have multiple uses, so here are three tips for building self-discipline that’ll help you stay strong in difficult times: Capture and commit. If you set out to drive across the country without a map, you’ll arrive somewhere, but there’s a very good chance it won’t be where you expected. It’s the same with your goals: Without a plan, who knows where you’ll end up? Instead, create a note in Evernote and add a checklist to build an action plan for each goal. Use Web Clipper to capture anything from the web that helps you visualize the achievement of your goal. Understand your strengths… AND weaknesses. Once you have a deeper understanding of where you perform best and where you may need a little help, you can play to your strengths and minimize your weaknesses. Use Evernote’s Daily Focus and Energy Tracker to help you identify your most productive times, and plan your day accordingly. Track, reflect, and correct . It’s easy to get discouraged when you mess up, but the fact that you tried is a victory; and you’ve learned something valuable in the process: what doesn’t work. Use Evernote’s Weekly Review template to take that information, make changes where you need to, and keep trying until you succeed. If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s that no matter how well you plan for the future, there will always be surprises. True success comes from learning how to navigate those unexpected changes and stay focused on what you want to achieve. Sometimes that will require a change of plans; sometimes it will mean rethinking your entire definition of success. But with a clear understanding of the challenges you face, and the determination to overcome them, you can still reach your goals.", "date": "2020-12-23,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Introducing the New Evernote for Android", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/new-evernote-android/", "abstract": "Today we’re pleased to announce that we are starting to roll out the new Evernote for Android, beginning with devices running Android 10 or later. This launch complements the release of our newly rebuilt apps for iOS , Windows , and Mac , making it easier than ever for you to create notes quickly, customize them however you like, find them in an instant, and take them wherever you go. The new app will be released via the Google Play Store over the next few weeks. If your device is running Android 10 or later and set to auto-update, it will be added to an automated update queue by Google. Once you see the new app in the Google Play Store, you can update manually or wait for the auto-update. But if your device is running Android 9 or older, or is not yet in the update queue, you won’t see the new app in the store. Here’s a sample of what’s new: A more intuitive and useful editor You now have more control over your notes’ appearance. Use semantic headers and tables to give structure to your notes. Or change fonts, colors, and highlights to add a personal touch. Checklists now get the VIP treatment they deserve. You can add list items, indent them, move them around—and enjoy the satisfaction of crossing them off with a single tap. Adding rich content (like audio, photos, checkboxes, attachments, and sketches) is quicker and easier with the new, multi-function Insert button. We’ve redesigned the formatting toolbar to put the most popular options front and center. One tap opens additional options like header level, highlighter colors, link editing, and more. Faster, more powerful search Save time—and taps. Get real-time search suggestions as you type to find what you’re looking for faster. Filter your searches by tag, attachment, PDF, URL, and more. So even the most elusive notes will now appear at your command. Is searching your Evernote superpower? Like to combine keywords, tags, or locations to find exactly what you need? Now you can save those searches and use them over and over again with just one tap. A cleaner, smoother interface We’ve combined the best aspects of our different platform interfaces into a new experience, so Evernote looks and behaves similarly whether you’re on your phone, a laptop, or switching between work and personal computers. The main screen has a cleaner, more modern look, so it’s easier on the eyes—and easier for you to get stuff done. Save more than text: Adding a new image, audio recording, sketch, or reminder is easier than ever thanks to the multi-function New Note button. We redesigned the document scanner to streamline how you capture information with your camera. In a flash, the app automatically recognizes documents, Post-it® notes, whiteboards, or business cards, scans them for readable text, suggests the best options for capturing them, and adds them to your notes. Ta da! We’ve introduced nested tags to give you even more ways to organize and find information. Rebuilt on an upgraded foundation This update moves the app to a new codebase that’s more stable and reliable, for fewer hang/crash errors. That new codebase means we can fix bugs quicker and release new features more often (yep, we’ve got some cool things already in development— join our Beta Program for a sneak peek!). Syncing data across different platforms and devices is smoother and more seamless than before. More coming soon Our top priority is providing you with the highest level of quality, speed, and reliability in our new apps. Although we’re launching the new Evernote for Android first on devices with Android 10 or later, we’re working hard to get the app ready for OS 9 and other older versions of Android OS as well, so more customers can take advantage of the latest improvements. Until then, if you aren’t auto-updated, you can continue to use the legacy version of Evernote for Android—we’ll be sure to let you know when the new app is available for your OS. We’re also busy adding back some features that weren’t quite ready in time for this release, and which you may be looking for. In particular, the new Android app doesn’t yet support widgets, multi-select, sharing a note via email, or password manager support. For an up-to-date list, please check out our Help & Learning article to see what’s new and what’s coming to Android. This update is one more step toward a more consistent and reliable platform across all your devices—and it lays the groundwork for new features and faster innovation to come.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Unlocking Evernote’s Future", "author": ["Ian Small"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/unlocking-evernotes-future/", "abstract": "Today, we shipped the brand new Evernote for iOS . This milestone marks the first in a series of releases we will make across Windows, Mac, and Android platforms. Anyone who’s followed Evernote’s progress knows this moment has been a long time coming. Much longer, in fact, than we expected when we set out to “focus on the basics” in January 2019 . Sometimes, the basics aren’t basic at all. Not when millions of people are relying on you, each with unique needs and ways of using Evernote. We know you’ve been looking forward to this day. We’re excited to be here. And we believe the wait has been worth it. As we’ve shown you through our Behind the Scenes videos , we’ve been working hard for you. Not only on the parts of the app you see and touch every day, but also on many parts you never have to think about. Our goal was to create a more coherent, more consistent Evernote experience. It had to have the speed, reliability, and scalability all of us expect. And it had to lay the groundwork for fast-paced future innovation. Today’s launch puts the proof in your hands: We have redesigned the iOS app to give you a cleaner experience with less friction. From your note list to the text formatting panel, everything is where you need and expect it to be. See our release notes for a full list. If you use Evernote on iOS and your web browser, you’ll find moving between them is a smoother and more consistent experience. Navigation, search, the note editor, and every other corner of the app now work in familiar ways across platforms. The app sits atop a stronger foundation. Our extensive testing and QA confirm what our beta testers and employees have known for a while: this release is more stable than any previous generation of our software. That new foundation also means you’ll enjoy improved speed, and our heaviest users will find much better handling of large notebooks. But we’re not done with performance yet. There are even more improvements ahead. The bottom line is we’re giving you a better, more engaging, and more helpful Evernote. Your notes will be more beautiful and useful thanks to our redesigned editor. You’ll find them faster through our search function, which has become more powerful and intuitive. And you’ll stay in the flow with our more reliable, intuitive, and consistent app. To get to this point, we’ve had to tackle and solve problems we didn’t even know we were taking on when we started. It’s taken a herculean effort. And we couldn’t have done it without the dedicated involvement of our Beta Program members—over 144,000 of you, representing just about every country in the world. Through your evaluation and feedback, you’ve told us what we got right, and where we needed to try again. You’ve shared how you work and what you expect, so we could build an app that better serves you and improves on what you’ve always loved about Evernote. Your help has been invaluable to getting us here, and the entire team thanks you. But this is not the finish line. Quite the opposite: today marks the starting line for a new Evernote. Over the next few weeks, all Evernote users on iPhone and iPad will gain access to the upgraded app. If you’ve set your device to auto-update, you won’t have to do anything to get it. There are a handful of features (such as editing tables, widgets, and Apple Watch support) that weren’t quite ready for today’s release, but we’re actively working to get those done and you should see them in one of our regular updates. Soon, we’ll bring the new app experience to our Windows, Mac, and Android users, rolling out to each platform as final testing rises to meet our expectations. We’re not stopping there, because we’ve worked too hard to allow these shiny new apps to stagnate. You can look forward to a new era of innovation at Evernote, and we’re excited about what the next year will bring. Looking beyond the basics, we’ve been working to prioritize, design, and develop several new features we hope to ship over the coming months. Some of these features address long-standing requests from our community; others are fresh ideas that reflect what we’ve seen and heard about the ways many of you use Evernote. Together, these features will keep moving us—and you—forward. As always, our Beta Program members will be part of helping us refine and ship these improvements, so now is a terrific time to join up . Today’s takeaway is that our iPhone and iPad users have a cool new app to download and try out; one that is better, faster, and easier to use. But that’s just one part of the story. The bigger story is that the elephant is back —energetic, vibrant, and delivering on our mission: empowering you to remember everything and accomplish anything. We invite you to take a moment to download and install the new Evernote on your iPhone or iPad. We think you’ll be pleased.", "date": "2020-09-16,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Introducing the New Evernote for iOS", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/introducing-new-evernote-ios/", "abstract": "The new Evernote for iOS has arrived! We’ve rebuilt the app from the ground up to make it easier for you to create notes quickly, customize them however you like, find them in an instant, and take them wherever you go. If you’ve set your device to auto-update, you won’t have to do anything: the new app will appear on your device within the next few weeks. But if you really can’t wait to try it, you can download the new Evernote right now from the iOS App Store . Here’s a sample of what’s new: A more intuitive and useful editor You now have more control over your notes’ appearance. Use semantic headers and tables to give structure to your notes. Or change fonts, colors, and highlights to add a personal touch. Checklists now get the VIP treatment they deserve. You can add list items, indent them, move them around—and enjoy the satisfaction of crossing them off with a single tap. Adding rich content (like audio, photos, checkboxes, attachments, and sketches) is quicker and easier with the new, multi-function Insert button. We’ve redesigned the formatting toolbar to put the most popular options front and center. One tap opens additional options like header level, highlighter colors, link editing, and more. Faster, more powerful search Save time—and taps. Get real-time search suggestions as you type to find what you’re looking for faster. Filter your searches by tag, attachment, PDF, URL, and more. So even the most elusive notes will now appear at your command. Is searching your Evernote superpower? Like to combine keywords, tags, or locations to find exactly what you need? Now you can save those searches and use them over and over again with just one tap. A cleaner, smoother interface The main screen has a cleaner, more modern look, so it’s easier on the eyes—and easier for you to get stuff done. Save more than text: Adding a new image, audio recording, sketch, or reminder is easier than ever thanks to the multi-function New Note button. We redesigned the document scanner to streamline how you capture information with your camera. In a flash, the app now automatically recognizes documents, Post-it(R) notes, whiteboards, or business cards, scans them for readable text, suggests the best options for capturing them, and adds them to your notes. Ta da! We’ve introduced nested tags to give you even more ways to organize and find information. Rebuilt on an upgraded foundation This update moves the app to a new codebase that’s more stable and reliable, for fewer hang/crash errors. That new codebase means we can fix bugs quicker and release new features more often (yep, we’ve got some cool things already in development— join our Beta Program for a sneak peek!). Syncing data across different platforms and devices is smoother and more seamless than before. More coming soon There are a handful of features (such as Apple Watch support) that are still on the way, but we’re actively working to release them in one of our regular updates. For an up-to-date list, please check out our Help & Learning article to see what’s new in iOS. And stay tuned: We’ll be rolling out the new Evernote on Windows, Mac, and Android soon, laying the groundwork for new features and faster innovation in the future. For more information about how we’re making Evernote more useful, more consistent, and more reliable across platforms , see today’s blog post from CEO Ian Small . Take a moment to download and install the new Evernote on your iPhone or iPad. This is a big update that we’re really proud of—and we think you’ll be pleased, too.", "date": "2020-09-16,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "4 Simple Ways to Break Your Bad Habits", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/break-bad-habits/", "abstract": "A lifetime of accomplishment is about more than just one goal—it’s about developing the tools you need to stay focused and achieve any goal. In 2020, Evernote will help you build your own flexible toolkit for success, with a year-long series covering the essential building blocks of productivity. No two people are alike, so this isn’t a pre-programmed series of steps you need to follow in order to be successful. It’s a set of tools and tips you can work on at your own pace, in any order. What you accomplish in 2020, then, is building a productivity toolset you can draw upon in the future to keep you moving in the direction of your dreams. Today, let’s look at the role bad habits play in holding you back, and how you can break free. “Just do it.” It’s one of the most famous advertising slogans of all time, and it’s made Nike world-famous. The message is simple: If you want to make a change—if you want to be healthier, happier, more successful—just… do it. So why doesn’t it work? Millions of people say they want to improve some part of their lives, but research shows only eight percent will actually achieve their goal. Clearly, wanting to improve isn’t enough. Before you can make a lasting change, you need to understand how bad habits develop, how persistent they are, and how to deal with the inevitable obstacles along the way. How habits form We’re all creatures of habit—but it’s not our fault. We’ve evolved that way. Your brain has an ingenious method for reducing workload and conserving energy, by recognizing patterns in your environment and remembering how you’ve responded to them in the past. Psychologist Wendy Wood says , “When you repeat an action over and over again in a given context and then get a reward when you do that, you are learning very slowly and incrementally to associate that context with that behavior.” James Clear, in his book “ Atomic Habits ,” calls this the ‘habit loop.’ It consists of: Cue – the trigger telling your subconscious mind to go into automatic mode. Craving – the desire or motivation behind your habits. As James says, “What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers.” Response – your habitual, learned reaction to the cue. Reward – the satisfying rush of dopamine you feel when you give in to the craving. This response mechanism is so efficient that, as Wendy Wood says , “We spend a shocking 43 percent of our day doing things without thinking about them.” How to overcome bad habits Let’s get this out of the way first: You can’t break a habit ; you can only replace it. Habits are hardwired into your brain, making them remarkably persistent. Once your mind has associated a response with a particular cue (reinforced by a predictable reward), it’s almost impossible to change. Willpower may succeed in overcoming it in the short term, but the habit loop is only suppressed, not broken. The good news is that healthy habits are just as resilient as bad ones. You can hack your mind, then, by replacing your bad habits with new, better habits. In time, they too become automatic and begin to overwrite the older routines that no longer serve you. Here are four ways you can kick those bad habits for good: 1. Identify your cues Do you reach for a donut every day at 3 p.m.? Pick up your phone every time it buzzes? Turn on the television as soon as you get home from work? These are a few of the subconscious routines that may be sabotaging you. To begin, stop and think about the triggers in your life. When do you feel the most stressed? Unhappy? Frustrated? How do you cope with those negative feelings? Are there any cue/routine patterns you can identify that are holding you back? Recognizing these stressors in your life can help you spot unproductive responses you may want to change, such as unhealthy food choices or negative self-talk. Create a list in Evernote of the cues you’ve identified, and review it every morning as soon as you wake up. ( Setting a reminder can help you with this.) Download Evernote’s Daily Recharge template and use it to record your emotions and reactions. Review it regularly and you’ll soon see where you can make positive changes in your life. Use journaling as a powerful tool for keeping track of your feelings. Your journal becomes a safe place to work through any negative thoughts and emotions, without worrying about what anyone else might think. 2. Increase the friction There’s a reason why supermarkets put shelves of candy beside the checkout, and why McDonald’s cashiers ask “Would you like fries with that?” It’s all about making it easy for you to indulge. To fight back, make it more difficult for you to engage in bad habits. If you constantly reach for candy, store it at the back of your fridge or pantry. Then, when you open the door, your eyes will be drawn to healthy options instead. If you’re addicted to your smartphone, put it in a drawer when you’re not using it. For bonus points, turn the power off before you do. It’s all about adding friction. Wendy Wood found that simply asking moviegoers to eat with their non-dominant hand made them consume less popcorn. Introducing one small step between the cue and the routine began to break the connection, even if only for a short time. Create a note and brainstorm ways you can add friction to your bad habits. Try one for a few days and see how it feels. When you’re ready to try some more (or if the first one isn’t right for you), go back to your note and try another. Reduce the junk food temptation by creating a shopping list in Evernote, and only buy what’s on the list. It’s okay to add the occasional treat—it’ll make it easier for you to stay on track—just be careful not to overdo it! 3. Substitute good habits As long as you continue to experience the same cues, your brain will react with the same old routines that have been holding you back. So, once you’ve identified the habits you want to eliminate, and made it more difficult to engage in them, it’s time to find alternative habits to replace them. If your routine is to eat a donut every afternoon, try placing a bowl of fresh fruit on the counter instead. Or, if you really need that sugar rush, walk down the street to a nearby coffee shop instead of the office kitchen. For bonus points, take the stairs instead of the elevator. You’re not cutting out the habit completely, but you’re making small changes that can add up to big wins over time. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) pioneered this concept of habit replacement over 70 years ago. Its 12-step program recognizes that the stresses of life don’t disappear when a person quits drinking. Instead, it encourages them to replace the habit of drinking with sharing their feelings in regular meetings. Create a table and add a row for each of the responses you want to change. Beside each one, list the ‘good’ habits you’ve decided to replace them with. For example, next to “Eat a donut at 3 p.m.” you could write “Eat an apple” or “Do 10 jumping jacks.” Build a support group of friends and family and share a public link to your note with them. This helps keep you accountable, and gives them a chance to encourage your efforts. 4. Track your progress When you’re in the middle of trying to replace bad habits, it can be hard to see how far you’ve come. As a result, it’s easy to become demoralized and slip back into old patterns. Instead, recognize that behavior change is a difficult, and sometimes painful, process; it’s normal to have the occasional setback. The secret is to anticipate and plan for tough times. For example, if your goal is to eat healthier, think about how you’ll deal with the temptation of a meal with friends— before you get to the restaurant. If your new habit is to run every day, what will you do when it rains? Keep a contingency plan in Evernote for dealing with setbacks like these to reduce your chances of falling back into old patterns. Tracking your progress is a powerful motivational tool. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld famously uses a calendar to maintain his writing habit, marking each day he writes new material. Get Evernote’s Habit Tracker template to see how well you’re doing with your new habits—but don’t be too hard on yourself if you miss a day! Simply forgive yourself for being human and jump back in as soon as you can. Download Evernote on all your devices so you can update your Habit Tracker no matter where you are. If you go for a walk, record how long you were gone to see how you’re improving over time. If you’re working on eating better, keep track of your food choices when you’re not at home. As anyone who has ever made a resolution can attest, eliminating bad habits is one of the hardest things to do. But, armed with insight into the workings of your brain and a few tools to help you stay on track, you can make real, lasting change, and start to build the future you’ve always imagined.", "date": "2020-01-29,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Crusading for Equal Pay, with Evernote by Her Side", "author": ["Lisa Dornell"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/crusading-for-equal-pay-with-evernote-by-her-side/", "abstract": "In her book, Navigating the Career Jungle: A Guide for Young Professionals , author and career advisor Jacqueline V. Twillie starts out with one of those pieces of common sense advice that should be obvious, but really isn’t. After explaining that networking is not about collecting business cards, but actually connecting with people, she points out that forging meaningful connections takes work. In order to impress potential employers or customers, “you must go into an event prepared and ready to seize an opportunity.” Preparing to make what you’re worth This emphasis on preparation is one keystone of Jacqueline’s mission. Helping young professionals get ahead is another. And while she has practical advice that any employee can use to negotiate a salary or a raise, her passion lies in working to end America’s persistent gender wage gap , in which women are commonly paid less than men for equivalent work. “It’s what I am meant to be doing,” she says. Jacqueline’s approach draws upon her personal experiences working for organizations as diverse as AT&T and the Centers for Disease Control. She has also worked for an IT staffing and recruiting company, helping Fortune 500 companies find the right person for the right job. Throughout her corporate experiences, she has seen gender pay disparity first-hand. “Women need to be educated on the wage gap, because there are a lot of misconceptions,” she says. “Equal pay in the news is great for awareness, but women need the education and tools to advocate for themselves to receive equal pay. It’s not a battle, it’s just a conversation.” According to Jacqueline, that conversation stands on four pillars: Prepare. Find out what salary you should be making in your role and industry. Practice. Strategize your pitch beforehand, anticipating difficult questions and preparing your answers. Ask. Work through your doubts, fears, and insecurities so you can gather the courage to ask for more. Decide. Realize you don’t need to accept an employer’s first offer. Ask for a few days to think things through so you can make the right decision. Jacqueline also advises women to change the way they approach job interviews : the more skill a candidate brings to highlighting past experience and showing off her industry knowledge, the stronger her negotiating position will be. As always, it begins with preparation, research, and gathering your thoughts. From collecting ideas to writing a book To help maintain her own sense of preparation, Jacqueline turns to Evernote. “I’ve used Evernote since 2009,” she says. “My first note was from a sermon at church.” But she found it equally useful in her work. “I’d just started working at a new job in a new city and was looking for a way to be more efficient. I had a lot of meetings and Evernote was the best tool I found for staying organized.” Evernote quickly moved from a way to corral loose ideas to a valuable organizational tool, and eventually helped Jacqueline combine her creative side with her corporate side. “I wrote part of my first book with Evernote,” she says. “I was working full-time while writing. Things would happen in the workplace that I thought would be good content for the book. I would capture it all in Evernote. And if I had a great idea while driving, I could record my voice in a note and still capture that idea.” It’s now one of her most-used tools. “It’s always useful. It’s on my homescreen and is one of my top four apps.” Starting with the basics For newcomers who might be overwhelmed by all Evernote can do, Jacqueline provides some of her patented common-sense advice. “Play around with basic notes first and gradually try the more advanced features. But it’s these features that make Evernote so great.” For Jacqueline, audio notes and the ability to take photos of notes written in her Moleskine notebook are key. “I love it for brainstorming on a new project. When starting something new, we don’t remember everything that comes to mind, and that’s what Evernote is good at.” What Jacqueline is good at is inspiring, educating, and, above all, advocating. “My goal is to continue to educate both women and men about leveling the playing field. This is what I’ll be working on until we have zero wage gap.” And, like all true crusaders, for her it’s not just a career choice. “This is my mission,” she explains.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "3 Ways to Improve Your Adaptability and Manage Your Life", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/improve-adaptability-manage-your-life/", "abstract": "Uncertainty is the new normal Have you felt on edge lately? Like the world is spinning out of control, and each passing year is less stable than the one before? In this fast-paced, tech-driven life, many of us feel overwhelmed even at the best of times. But add a global pandemic, massive economic disruption, social unrest, and the looming threat of climate change, and it’s enough to make anyone lose sleep. Even without another disaster, it’s easy to see that change is speeding up. As far back as 1987, the U.S. Army War College defined a state called VUCA—short for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity —as an emerging new normal. We see VUCA in action every day, from the disruptive pace of new technology and automation to massive changes in how and where we work. Life, it seems, really is a state of constant flux . So if you’re feeling anxious and lost, that’s normal. It’s not a failure on your part. And the good news is that it’s fixable. You can’t always know or control what tomorrow will bring, but you can control how you react to change. Will you flounder and drown, or will you find stable ground and take advantage of fresh opportunities? Your adaptability , along with the overlapping traits of resilience and emotional intelligence , may well tip the balance. What does adaptability mean, really? Being adaptable doesn’t mean “going with the flow” and letting the currents carry you along. A better definition comes from Andrew J. Martin of the University of New South Wales, who identified three components of adaptability : Adjusting your thoughts and thinking in response to change Managing positive and negative emotional responses to change Altering your behavior in response to change True adaptability begins with rational thought and ends with deliberate action. It’s a growth mindset —an understanding of how to adapt to change that anyone can cultivate through self-reflection, creative thinking, and intentional practice. Be ready for anything: Your adaptability toolkit As executive coach Jennifer Jones noted in a 2017 TED Talk , “we’re losing the ability to adapt because we’re not taking the time and attention to prepare and develop ourselves. We’re jumping from change to change, acting on impulse, not acting on strategy.” Here are three sets of specific tools you can use right now to build that strategy, become more adaptable, and navigate even the scariest change: 1. Follow the North Star We’ve written before about why goals matter, and how achieving those goals requires specific, realistic plans . But in a world of constant change, your goals and plans can become obsolete overnight. What happens then? To answer that question, imagine someone has dropped you in an unfamiliar part of the world, deep in the woods. How would you find your way home? First, you’d need to know which way is north. To become more adaptable, you need goals big enough to provide a True North in your life. You also need enough self-understanding to draw a map and figure out where you stand in relation to those goals. Take action: Find your North: Ask yourself these questions: What is my personal or professional purpose? What makes me feel fulfilled as a human being? Which parts of me are so fundamental that external change can’t ruin them? Write your answers down . Identify landmarks: What talents, skills, or experience do you have right now that few others possess? A mastery of JavaScript? A flair for baking? An encyclopedic knowledge of Marvel Comics? Take inventory, put it all in writing, and don’t be shy. Draw a map: Creating a Life Map helps you connect the dots between your North Star goals and where you are today. Grab some paper and markers and you can have it done in an hour. Break down your plans: Once you have the big picture, future-proof your plans by breaking them down into short, medium, and long-term scales . Make detailed plans for the next week or two, define general milestones for the next few months, and limit the long term to one or two core principles. Keep all these notes together in Evernote . Come back to them whenever you’re feeling anxious or adrift. They’ll reconnect you to the things that matter most, so you can blaze a new path forward. 2. Expand your comfort zone Adapting to change is hard if you’re stuck in a habitual pattern. We stay in our “comfort zone” because it’s safe and predictable—but it also holds us back . We’re comfortable with what we know. Learning and growth require more. Outside the comfort zone, things can get scary. When our situation changes too much or too fast, the comfort zone can vanish along with it, leaving us in a “red zone” of anxiety and panic. That’s when our “fight or flight” instincts take over. Switching to reflex is a good survival skill when facing a rampaging tiger, but not so helpful when we have to adapt our lives and businesses to social distancing or changing market forces. Thankfully, you don’t have to choose between comfort and panic. There’s a third zone in between —the learning zone—where we become more adaptable. We step into this zone when we engage with new ideas, practice creativity, or pick up new skills. The more time you spend in the learning zone, the more alternative possibilities you discover. Eventually, your comfort zone expands and your panic zone shrinks. Take action: Set your curiosity free: Open yourself up to new ideas and influences . Read books in categories you wouldn’t normally pick up and note your reactions. Expand your social media bubble to include experts within (and beyond!) your field. Break your daily routine and try new experiences. Learn new skills: Expand your horizons by picking up skills that complement the ones you already have. If you love digital photography, shooting with black-and-white film can teach you to slow down and see a subject with fresh eyes. If you’re good at coding, taking a design class can give you a deeper understanding of how others interact with your work. Flex your creative muscles: You may not think of yourself as a creative being, but you truly are . Writing, art, improvisation, and music are powerful ways to improve mental flexibility. And there’s growing evidence that it can literally rewire your brain . How cool is that? Keep inspiration handy: You come across interesting ideas, articles, and images every day; things that may not apply to your life now but might be useful later. Don’t let them slip away! A commonplace book or spark file in Evernote can become a bottomless source of inspiration. Browse through it whenever you’re stuck for a fresh solution—the answer may already be in your notes! 3. Learn from your mistakes (and your successes) So far, you’ve been laying the groundwork for a more adaptable version of yourself. You have a map to orient you. You’ve expanded your comfort zone, so the unknown feels less threatening. The next step is to build adaptation into your routine . Remember, adaptation isn’t just about going with the flow; it’s a mindset bolstered by consistent practice. That means you have to become more self-aware, and be willing to give yourself honest, constructive critique. Get into the habit of recording your progress. Direct your focus into the things that are working, discard the rest, and look for new alternatives. Take action: Record your life: Keeping a journal is a terrific way to track and understand your emotional state. A journal can help you identify stress triggers, assess your responses, and work through problems or fears. All of that matters when you have to respond to a challenging situation. Catalog your failures: This might sound like a ticket to low self-esteem, but a failure log is actually a powerful tool for growth . Look for the specific reasons things didn’t work out. Did you need more training? A better plan? More support from your colleagues? How can you better prepare for the next attempt? The takeaway is not that you screwed up, but that you can improve . Give yourself some love: Looking at your failures can take a heavy emotional toll, so make sure you’re balancing the negative with the positive. Track your small wins and all the things you do to help yourself grow: your reading, classes, workouts, and creative outlets. Consider starting a gratitude journal or a “ done list ” to remind yourself of everything that’s going right. There’s probably more than you realize. Remix, revamp, repeat Our final tip is the simplest: Schedule time each week to review how things are going. Keep this appointment with yourself sacred, because this is where everything comes together. Looking over your journal, ask yourself: What’s working, and what isn’t? What new ideas have you added to your inspiration notebook that might bring you more in line with the goals in your Life Map? What project or skill should you pursue next? Sometimes adapting is easy. If the pandemic ruined your plan to hit the gym three days a week, you can always work out at home. Other challenges are far more difficult, but still solvable. If you’ve lost your job, for example, you can regroup. Use your inventory, Life Map, and creative skills to brainstorm new opportunities—offering your skills as a freelancer, partnering with others in mutual support, or changing career paths. As you consider your options, look for unexpected connections . Practice divergent and convergent thinking to brainstorm as many ideas as possible and select the best ones. Above all, focus on solutions, not problems. Adjust your outlook, change your behavior, and see what happens.", "date": "2020-09-1,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Improving Your Productivity", "author": ["Darius Foroux"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/ultimate-guide-improving-productivity/", "abstract": "Darius Foroux is an author, entrepreneur, and podcaster. He writes at DariusForoux.com , where he shares ideas for living a productive life. Welcome to this productivity guide. The purpose of this guide is twofold. First, I will define what productivity is. Too often, we try to improve productivity without knowing what it is. Second, I’ll share tested and proven ways to improve your productivity. Productivity is not something we only study once; it’s a continuous practice . I hope you find this guide useful. The Best Definition Of Productivity Productivity is a concept that’s widely misunderstood. The main reason is that we use the word productivity on a macro and micro scale. On the news, we read about workforce productivity, which is basically the aggregate output of all workers. So when we read “Productivity increased in September,” we’re confused. Those macro trends have nothing to do with how productive a person is. To me, productivity is a personal measure—especially in the 21st century when most of us work independently. We’re no longer machine operators; we’re skilled knowledge workers who manage their own time and energy. Based on the above, there are two types of productivity: Workforce productivity: The total amount of goods and services workers produce in a certain period. Personal productivity: The relevant output of an individual in a certain period. You do not control the former but you have 100% control over the latter. Hence, if a person, manager, CEO, or leader wants to improve collective productivity, one must improve personal productivity. One note on the definition of personal productivity: By relevant output, I mean working on the right things. You can be highly productive and have a lot of output, but the results you achieve might be useless. When you focus on relevant output, you get the right things done; things that improve your career, business, or organization. Also, it’s important to look at productivity over a certain period, preferably monthly. Consistent output is what drives results. Benefits Of Improved Productivity Productivity is the #1 measure that defines growth in the economy and one’s living standards (higher income, better benefits, more free time). Ray Dalio, a well-known investor and philanthropist, emphasized the importance of productivity in his explainer video How The Economic Machine Works . In the 30-minute video, he explains how the economy works and gives advice on how you can increase your wealth. His most important piece of advice? Here it is: ”Do all that you can to raise your productivity, because in the long run, that’s what matters most.” The benefits of increasing your productivity are clear: When you work on the right things, you will get more and better results. That’s how we realize growth. Here are three additional benefits of improved productivity: Innovation —Modern-day life and work have always been about change. However, the pace of change has substantially increased in the 21st Century. Also, technology has increased our productivity. But the reverse is also true: Our increased productivity leads to more innovation and new technology. The more productive we become, the more we can innovate. Self-confidence —In 1952, Bernice Milburn Moore published an article called Self-Confidence For Competence in the journal of Educational Leadership. In the article, she shares how self-confidence is boosted by your competencies. In other words: The better you get at something, the more self-confident you will be. The more productive you are, the more competencies you can develop. Hence, the more confident you will become. Higher engagement —The more involved and passionate someone is about their work, the higher their level of work engagement is. The research into productivity is robust. But it doesn’t require scientific research to experience the power of productivity. Simply improve your personal productivity and see what effects it has on your work, energy, mind, rewards, happiness, etc. Common Productivity Challenges Before I share the most commonly used techniques to improve productivity, I want to focus on the biggest obstacles. If you don’t address these common blocks, none of the productivity tips will stick. Distractions — The modern-day workplace is an inherently distracting place. Enter any office building and you’ll see countless people in meeting rooms, walking around, drinking coffee, or chatting about the latest episode of a popular entertainment show. If that’s not distracting enough, we all own devices that demand our attention. As a result, we can’t work on our tasks without getting interrupted for five minutes. Personal reasons — Life is demanding. Some of us work 10 hours a day (or more). That leaves us only a few hours of spare time in the evenings. As a result, we’re spread too thin because we also have our personal demands like relationships, family, doing groceries, paying bills, working out, etc. Not enough training — We want to be more focused at work. We want to be more calm in our personal lives. We want to make sure our lives matter. But we don’t see productivity as a skill one can learn. All the above challenges can be solved by improving your productivity skills. It’s important to be aware of what’s standing in your way to becoming your most productive self. For most of us, the three roadblocks above are the biggest ones. We need to commit to overcoming them and strive to reach our full potential. Widely Used Productivity Tips To achieve your full potential, use the following productivity tips. All the techniques have been tried and tested. More than 30 million people have read my articles since 2015. I’ve received thousands of emails from people all over the world. The techniques I share below are the most effective ones according to readers. How To Journal For Self-Improvement — While you might think that journaling has nothing to do with improving productivity; keeping a journal is one of the most powerful tools on earth. Many historical figures kept one. It can’t be a coincidence. If you’re starting with personal development, I recommend starting with journaling as well. The Pomodoro Method: Take Strategic Breaks To Improve Productivity — This method instantly improves your focus. It’s been highly researched. And the results are clear: The Pomodoro method is one of the best productivity techniques that exist.

What’s the first thing you want to improve when it comes to productivity? You can come back to this guide as much as you like. Best Productivity Books The funny thing is that the best books I’ve read about productivity are not productivity books. Instead, they are about living a meaningful life. Here are the four best productivity books I’ve read. The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker — It’s no secret I’m a fan of Drucker. This book provides a practical perspective on productivity that I think every knowledge worker should read. The most important lesson I’ve learned about work is this: It’s not about what you do, it’s about the results you get. That’s the difference between efficiency and effectiveness. Sending 100 emails per hour might be a very efficient use of your time. But what results does it bring you? That’s what matters the most. Essentialism by Greg McKeown — Productivity is about doing the right things. And this book helps you to focus better on what matters to you, personally. Once you know what you’re after, it’s easier to get there. The Power Of Habit by Charles Duhigg — Forming new habits is a practical skill that immediately impacts the quality of your life. Want to lose weight? Be more productive? Exercise regularly? Build successful companies? One thing is sure: Without habits, those things will be extremely difficult to pull off. Daily Rituals by Mason Currey — A unique insight into the habits and rituals of the world’s most renown figures. You’ll be surprised how simple their lives were. Productivity Tools and Apps That Actually Work Productivity tools can make your life a lot simpler. They help you to save time, improve focus, and improve the overall quality of our work. However, every time I talk about productivity tools, I also talk about the downside. Too much technology often decreases our productivity. That’s why the list of apps and tools is short. I don’t overcomplicate productivity. Notebook — I prefer A5 sized notebooks with a soft cover and good quality paper. This Moleskine does the job well. Calendar — My standard iOS calendar app is my favorite productivity tool. I primarily use my calendar for time blocking. Trello — Trello is a versatile project management tool that can be used in many ways. I use this productivity app as a backlog of tasks that I have to do. With Trello you can create ‘boards’ for every project you have. And on every board, you can list all the actions you have to complete for that project. Every week I take some time to update my projects. That helps me to improve my focus, so I know what I have to do. Evernote — By far the best note-taking app there is. Research shows that our brain works in a similar way Evernote stores notes, ideas, tasks, etc. RescueTime — The easiest way to track your activities. You’ll be surprised how much time you’re wasting on useless activities. Measure it with RescueTime, become aware of the time-wasting activities, and then get rid of them. Grammarly — I use this tool probably the most out of all the resources on this page. If you’re writing anything that’s more than an email, use this app. I highly recommend getting the premium edition. Be Focused — This is the Pomodoro app I use on Mac. But any app will do. It’s important that the timer is visible . Whenever I don’t use a Pomodoro timer, I just waste hours every day. This app can easily save you one hour per day. SelfControl (Mac) / FocusMe (Mac & Windows) — I use this to block distracting sites. Day One — When I don’t use pen and paper for journaling, I use Day One. I prefer to have a dedicated journaling app. Otherwise, my Evernote gets too cluttered. Originally published on dariusforoux.com .", "date": "2019-11-22,"},

That’s why we redesigned Evernote for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with speed and simplicity in mind, so you can spend more of your time capturing ideas and less time organizing and searching for them.  Say hello to Evernote 8.0, now available for download from the App Store . To get the inside story on these changes, watch the Facebook Live event (originally streamed on Wednesday, January 18) with Kara Hodecker, Evernote’s product design manager, the woman behind our look and feel on iOS. Learn more » What’s New? With your feature requests in mind, our iOS design and engineering teams set out to reimagine the Evernote experience from the ground up. Evernote 8.0 for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch is our fastest, most elegant iOS app ever: Faster ways to find notes New notes, now just one tap away Add color and style to your notes Faster ways to find notes One of the first things you’ll notice is that we’ve improved the overall navigation structure so you can get to your notes quicker. We’ve removed the home screen so you’ll have immediate access to your most recently updated notes. This way, you can start working from where you last left off. No extra taps required. You’ll also notice that the app has a fresh, new look. Even your note list has been spruced up so you can scan through your notes more quickly. Devoted notebook fans will also love the way Evernote 8.0 makes it easy to dive in and out of notebooks to find notes. Simply tap the notebook selector above any note list to jump into another notebook. Do you organize with tags or reminders? Evernote 8.0 comes with two new search features you’ll appreciate. A quick tap of the alarm clock located at the top of any note list brings up all the notes you’ve set up with reminders. To see only those notes associated with particular tags, tap the tag button located at the top of any note list and select the tags you want to filter for. New notes, now just one tap away Note-taking should be simple, so we simplified it. Open Evernote and tap the green ‘plus sign’ button to create a new text note. Long press this same button and slide your finger to record audio, capture images (such as business cards, whiteboards, and receipts), and set up notifications to remind you to take action on a particular note. Clarify with new colors and styles Sometimes, plain black text isn’t enough. Evernote 8.0 gives you more ways to style your text. Use different colors and sizes to create headers and subheaders, call attention to key points, or make it easier to recall information. We make it easy by offering several pre-defined text colors and font sizes for you to choose from. What’s new for our Evernote Business customers For Evernote Business customers, who rely on Evernote to stay productive in both their personal and professional lives, there’s a clearer division between your personal and business notes, notebooks, shortcuts, and saved searches. This way, you won’t accidentally save a cake recipe to your company’s marketing team notebook and your company meeting notes won’t appear in your family’s shared travel planning notebook. We’ve also made it easier to switch between your personal and business accounts. Simply long-press ‘Account’ on the tab bar to switch to another account. We think that once you’ve set eyes on the new Evernote 8.0 app, you’ll agree with many of those in our Beta community who say it’s the best version of the Evernote iOS app ever. Try it today and you’ll see for yourself just how fast, simple, and elegant your Evernote experience on iOS can be.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Capture Your Ideas and Accomplish More", "author": ["Emily Esposito"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/capture-ideas-accomplish-more/", "abstract": "Unless you’ve been stranded on a deserted island for the past few months, you’ve likely heard the news: the film version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical, “Hamilton,” has finally arrived. And while it may have taken five years for the show to get from Broadway to the big screen, that’s nothing compared to the seven years it took Lin-Manuel to write it. Along the way, he created material in some unusual places : riding New York City’s famous “A” train, in the Dominican Republic—even on his honeymoon! That Lin-Manuel found inspiration all around him isn’t surprising; breaking out of the everyday is a great way to spark fresh ideas . But ideas can be fleeting. Evernote’s founder Stepan Pachikov once said , “An interesting moment in life lasts only a moment.” The challenge is grabbing hold of those moments—those brilliant ideas—so they can live forever. To do that, you need a strategy for capturing them when inspiration strikes. Propelling the creative process forward It may seem obvious that capturing ideas in the moment helps you remember them and clears your mind to focus on other things . But the benefits don’t stop there. While the seed of an idea can begin to grow in your mind, it can’t fully flourish until you get it out of your head. Refining your thoughts: Facts and feelings can all swirl together in your mind, making it difficult to get perspective. When you write everything down , it’s easier to see the big picture, identify patterns, and understand what’s most important. Sparking new ideas: As you’re working through one idea, you may get inspired to go in a totally different direction. Or, you may revisit an idea you had months ago and find new ways to bring it to life. Boosting productivity: A study found that vividly describing your goals makes you 1.2 to 1.4 times more likely to accomplish them. This same theory can apply to creative planning: capturing all the details about an idea increases your chances of pursuing it. How to get ideas out of your head and into a note There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to documenting your ideas. It’s best to experiment with a variety of media—words, drawings, images, audio, or video—to see what resonates with you. The goal is to find an approach that feels intuitive and complements your individual thought process. Here are four ways to capture your ideas: Quiet your doubts with freewriting It’s easy to feel confident when you’re alone with your thoughts. When you have to turn those nebulous ideas into words, however, you can start doubting yourself. Your momentum stalls and what was once an exciting idea fizzles out on the page. Author Seth Godin blames our ‘ lizard brain ,’ or amygdala , for this resistance. In his book, “ Linchpin ,” Seth writes, “The lizard brain is the reason you’re afraid, the reason you don’t do all the art you can, the reason you don’t ship when you can.” It’s the voice in your head that questions your decisions, pushing you to play it safe. However, you can train yourself to fight against this doubt with freewriting. The goal of freewriting is simple: write without stopping. Choose a time limit, put your pen to paper or your hands on the keyboard, and don’t stop until the time is up. Don’t worry about grammar or spelling, and if you can’t think of anything to say, keep repeating your main idea or write something like, “I’m waiting for an idea to come.” Freewriting not only helps you express an idea, it also allows you to build your confidence. By regularly freewriting, you’ll become more comfortable describing your thoughts. Then, when you do stumble upon a great idea, you’ll be faster and more confident capturing it in the moment. Pro tip : Create a dedicated note in Evernote that acts as a journal , where you can store all your freewriting. Dictate your ideas, wherever you are You articulate ideas differently when you have to write them down. Think about how you sound when you’re writing versus talking out loud; you’re bound to use a separate vocabulary and your tone can differ. You may also find it harder to communicate your thoughts when writing, even with effective strategies like freewriting. If you’re feeling stuck capturing your creative ideas with a pen or keyboard, record yourself explaining them out loud. Let’s say you’re brainstorming new ways to run your annual user conference at work. How would you summarize it in one sentence? Pretend you’re describing your ideas to your best friend. What else would she want to know? What questions would she have? Dictating also helps you capture ideas wherever you are, whether you’re driving in the car or taking a walk around your neighborhood. In fact, a Stanford study found that walking can improve creativity by as much as 60 percent. Dictation allows you to capture this creativity and stay in the flow, rather than having to stop mid-walk and find a place to sit and type. Pro tip : Record an audio note directly into Evernote, then add comments to it later. You can even use your device’s speech-to-text capabilities to transcribe your ideas. Draw a mind map for nascent ideas For fully-baked ideas, the goal is to record as many details as possible so you can immediately act. With smaller, growing ideas, it’s impossible to focus on the specifics. Instead, capture that small spark—a single word or image—with the goal of jump-starting new streams of inspiration. Mind mapping is the perfect way to capture these sparks. Rather than describing your idea in sentences, simply write a word in the center of a sheet. Then add related words or thoughts around that central topic, connecting each of them to the center with a line. Repeat the same process for subtopics, continually adding layers around your main idea. The end result is like a tree, with all related thoughts and topics acting as branches. The beauty of mind maps is their freeform nature—you can record your ideas as they come to you, in any order. This freedom helps with creative planning: According to one survey , mind maps can increase productivity and creativity by 30 percent. Pro tips : Use an app such as MindMaster , XMind , or TheBrain to create your mind map, then save the results in Evernote. Sketch a mind map directly in Evernote on your iPhone or iPad using your finger or a stylus. Create a space for collaborative ideas Writing, dictation, and mind maps are powerful ways to capture your own ideas ; you can work at your own pace and create whatever output makes sense for you. However, not all ideas flow through one person. When you’re working with a team, you have to account for different ways people come up with ideas, process them, and articulate them. Creating a shared space can offer the right level of flexibility for everyone. Think of it like a digital melting pot, where each person is free to use whatever medium best represents their ideas: words, images, videos, or even existing content like news articles or blogs. To begin, simply create a notebook in Evernote and click the Share button to invite your colleagues to contribute. They can add content and suggestions to your notes, or create their own notes. The end result is a collaborative, multimedia representation of everyone’s ideas. Pro tip: Save and annotate images and PDFs in Evernote, and use Web Clipper to capture inspiring web pages. Preserving your big ideas There are thousands of ideas flowing through your brain every hour, so it’s crucial you have a plan for capturing them. By bringing your ideas to life—through words, drawings, or audio—you can preserve them forever. Then, when you revisit them later, you’ll be transported back to that experience of thought—free to pick up where you left off and explore the new possibilities your mind has created.", "date": "2020-07-28,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Break the Monotony to Spark Inspiration", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/break-monotony-to-spark-inspiration/", "abstract": "Sometimes, great ideas come out of nowhere. Maybe you’ve been focusing on a tough problem for days with no end in sight, and then— poof —a creative solution falls in your lap. These flashes of brilliance rarely happen when you’re parked at your desk all day, zeroed in on a single project. While it’s important to focus, too much focus on one thing can cause a kind of mental tunnel vision, closing you off to new ideas. As a result, your work can begin to feel mundane and uninspired. With deadlines fast approaching or colleagues nudging you for status updates, there’s always a reason to stay head down and closed off. That’s why we’re offering four simple strategies for being more open to inspiration, each with its own “time hack” so you can fit it into your life—hassle free. 1. Invite something new According to psychologists Todd Thrash and Andrew Elliot, people tend to be more inspired when they’re open to new experiences . So it isn’t just a matter of stepping away from the problem at hand, it’s about stepping towards something outside your normal routine to purposefully clear your mind and make way for fresh ideas. Taking breaks from your workday encourages new thoughts to percolate. While your mind relaxes, keep a freewriting journal where you capture your thoughts, no matter how random they might seem. No one else will read it, so don’t worry about editing or censoring yourself. When you want something more physically active, go for a walk and take pictures of things that capture your attention. If you use Evernote, keep your freewriting and images in the same notebook and refer to them any time you get stuck on a project and want an influx of different ideas. The ideas and images you capture may not relate at all to the work you’re doing, but this small practice of mindfulness will help you think in new ways, which can lead to being more inspired in everything you do. Time hack: Create bite-sized tasks . To create your journaling break times, try the Action Method developed by Behance: Split each of your work projects into small, manageable tasks called “action steps.” For example, let’s say you have to create a presentation. Some of your action steps might be: Outline the main points, gather the necessary images, write the introduction . After you complete an action step, take a break for 5 to 15 minutes. This might give you a few breaks throughout the day, at least one of which you can use to add to your journal. 2. Seek different perspectives Ever reached for your phone to do something work-related only to lose half an hour on an epic social media binge? If so, don’t feel bad. We’re about to give you an excuse to do this more often. Psychologists at Texas A&M University found that people are often most inspired when they’re looking at work from others who are similar to themselves but more accomplished. This isn’t about comparing yourself to anyone. It’s about seeking out quality content in your field that comes from different perspectives. To do this, practice mindfulness in your social media feeds. How much of your screen time do the people posting celebrity memes and cat pics all day really deserve? Try mixing in some different voices by seeking out professionals doing or saying interesting things relevant to your line of work. Maybe find someone that helps you learn about the history of your craft or discipline. Cull through your accounts so the next time you reach for your phone, you’re greeted with innovative content related to your field. This way, you’re still kicking back on a social media break, but with the added bonus of seeing some inspiring material. Save anything that sparks an idea for one of your projects to Evernote, whether you’re on your computer or mobile device. Time hack: Take 5 every 25 If you already take random social media breaks throughout the day, you can go right on doing so guilt-free. But if you want more structured break times, try the Pomodoro Technique . We’ve recommended this technique before for its utter simplicity: Set a timer for 25-minutes. When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. After the break, set another 25-minute timer. Rinse and repeat. 3. Practice without pressure According to Thrash and Elliot, inspired individuals tend to get their best ideas after they’ve worked on mastering their skills. In other words, building your chops at whatever you want to accomplish is like laying the tracks for inspiration to come. This doesn’t mean inspiration can be forced by plowing forward through your projects. It means that refining your craft helps you harness inspiration more easily. For example, if you’re a visual designer who struggles with illustration, you might work on a small personal project that focuses on illustration. Or if you’re a manager having trouble motivating your team, read up on the psychology around motivation. Don’t have time to read? Listen to an audiobook in the car or while doing household chores. Making time for this sort of deliberate practice away from workplace pressures allows you to develop in your field without worrying about making mistakes. Time hack: Pencil yourself in To create a block of time where you can work on building your skills, check your calendar at the start of each work week. Find at least 30 minutes of free time and schedule it, so your coworkers see that, during that time, you’re unavailable. Just like that, you have a sacred space in your week where you can refine your work-related skills . 4. When inspiration comes, welcome it One of the best ways to be open to inspiration is to not be closed to it. Sounds obvious, but think about all the great ideas you’ve gotten at inconvenient times: the perfect intro to that presentation that came to you in line at the checkout counter, the explanation for the anomaly in the financial data that sprang to mind at midnight. If you’ve ever failed to capture a fleeting insight, don’t worry. It happens to the best of us. Your days are likely filled with things that occupy your attention, making it nearly impossible to disengage when inspiration strikes. To deal with this, keep your tools for capturing unexpected brilliance always at the ready. Sync your Evernote account to all your devices and use shortcuts to keep the notes where you capture inspiration always at your fingertips. If you’d rather go offline after the workday, carry a physical notebook with you, or place a few in different rooms throughout your living space—whatever makes it easy to harness ideas the moment they arrive. Time hack: Feel the power of “no” Build wiggle room into your schedule to give yourself more freedom to capture good ideas, even if they come at inconvenient times. To do this, protect your time by saying “no” more often. This is easier said than done, but remember that you’re not obligated to let others pick your brain at a moment’s notice or to accept every last-minute meeting invite. If you have a hard time declining these kinds of requests, try using an I don’t statement rather than an I can’t or an I won’t statement. Studies show that explaining why you don’t do something is more empowering for you and more likely to be accepted by others. For example, if a coworker asks you to join a conference call with only a ten-minute warning, you might explain that you don’t interrupt scheduled focus time unless it’s an emergency, but you’d be glad to check in at the end of the day to get filled in. You might find that they accept your boundary without an issue. While you can’t control when inspiration comes, you can control your openness to new experiences, your willingness to seek out different perspectives, and your dedication to your craft, all of which can make the muse more likely to pay you a visit.", "date": "2020-06-29,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How Evernoters Use Evernote: Darrick Gets You Sorted", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-evernoters-use-evernote-darrick-gets-you-sorted/", "abstract": "Interested in specific ways Evernote can help make your daily life a little easier? In this series, Evernote employees offer handy pro tips to help you beat information overload and be more productive with less effort. If you find it hard to remember all the important details in your day-to-day, it’s not your fault. Turns out that our brains are great at solving problems—not so great at storing information . Fortunately, Evernote can remember things, so you don’t have to. Our own Darrick Price shows you how. His method centers on a simple concept: capture what’s important in the moment. As an Evernote Customer Success Manager and father of five, Darrick has stacks of customer accounts and Wednesday school folders constantly vying for his attention. Before he had a system for keeping track of it all, things sometimes fell through the cracks. “In the past,” he recalls, “I’ve felt so guilty when I forgot about my kids’ Valentine’s Day party, for example. If it’s not in the next ten days then it’s out of sight, out of mind.” Respect the default notebook Darrick’s problem is a common one—he has a lot to remember. “With bills, everyday life, kids, family, all of the things that are important to me taking up space in my mind,” he says, “stuff gets lost.” Darrick’s solution is to put all of his important information into his default notebook to be sorted later. If you use Evernote, you also have a default notebook . It’s the notebook where new notes are saved automatically if another notebook isn’t specified. And it’s Darrick’s secret weapon. When he encounters something he wants to remember, he captures it to his default notebook, which he’s entitled “Inbox.” If what he wants is in an email, he imports it. If it’s online, he saves it with Web Clipper . If he’s out and about, he might use Evernote’s camera feature. In the moment when he’s capturing something, he’s busy, so he doesn’t take time to organize anything (yet). “As I’m processing work emails, shopping, or looking at something I need to remember,” he explains, “I throw everything in that Inbox notebook, indiscriminately.” This lets Darrick save what he needs without breaking his flow. For example, one of Darrick’s sons plays football. Recently, while the two of them were at a sporting goods store, his son mentioned a pair of cleats he wanted. Darrick discreetly snapped a picture using Evernote’s camera. This automatically created a note with the picture and saved it to his default notebook. Everything in its place If he wanted to, Darrick could leave everything in his default notebook and just use Evernote’s search feature to find things later. But he does some simple sorting to make things even easier to find. The first thing Darrick does when he gets to work each day is move each note in his default notebook to the notebook where it belongs, which for him is one of the following: Work, Personal, Important docs, Shopping, Learning, Vacation planning, School docs, Kids resources. Darrick also tends to put a lot of related information into a single note, which helps him find what he needs faster. For example, at work Darrick keeps all the information associated with a given customer in a single note. This note might include details from their conversations, documents, emails, and contact information. When he needs to do something for that customer, he doesn’t have to think about where to find the right information. He simply goes to their note in his Work notebook, and everything he needs is right there. Tagged and found When Darrick moves a note from his default notebook to the appropriate notebook, he also tags it. In simple terms, tags make notes easier to find. Tags also let you see related notes side-by-side, even if they’re in different notebooks. “I have a tag for each one of my children,” he says. He also has a tag for each of their schools, each sport they play, and each activity they’re involved in. So as he sorts his notes, he gives each one the relevant tags. For example, he might add the tags football and gifts to the note with the cleats he wants to get for his son. Now, when it comes time to go shopping, say Christmas or a birthday, Darrick doesn’t have to go hunting for the picture. He just opens Evernote, types “football” in the search box, and the picture with the info he needs shows up in the results. This means that Darrick can always find what he needs without having to remember anything but the most general information. It also means he pays more attention to his son when they’re together. Never another gift card Knowing that at any moment he might encounter something worth saving, Darrick listens more carefully to his family, not just for clues about what to buy them, but for details about what’s important to them that he doesn’t want to forget. “Evernote has helped me become such a more active parent,” Darrick says, pointing out that he’s now better able to participate in his kids’ activities. “In our consumer environment today,” he adds, “everything is about instantaneous gratification and as parents sometimes we say, ‘here’s 50 dollars,’ and we take the easy way out. Growing up, my mother always told me to pay attention to the things the people you love say. If you pay attention, you never have to ask them what they need. You’ll just know. I don’t think I’ve ever seen my mother purchase a gift card a day in her life.” He thinks for a second, then adds, “There’s nothing greater for me than to see a smile on my children’s faces when I’ve gifted them something they weren’t expecting, and they’re like, ‘I can’t believe you remembered this.’”", "date": "2020-06-4,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Three Steps to Finding Inspiration in Unexpected Places", "author": ["Emily Esposito"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/three-steps-finding-inspiration/", "abstract": "Ideas can be born from the most unexpected places. Author J.K. Rowling first had the idea for Harry Potter while sitting on a delayed train . John Lennon was inspired to write “Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!” while looking at an interesting poster in an antique shop. And Nikola Tesla came up with his idea of alternating electric currents while out on a leisurely stroll. How did they do it? As Steve Jobs once said , “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.” Oftentimes you may feel stuck, when actually you’re close to a breakthrough and all you need is a little nudge to finalize the idea. Making connections between unlikely elements can unlock that “aha” moment that shows you the answer. Here are three steps to making those elusive connections and boosting your creativity: Step 1: Train your brain in divergent thinking We all have that friend or colleague who is exceptionally creative—who comes up with ideas that never even crossed your mind. While some people are naturally more inclined to make these connections, anyone can learn how to find inspiration in unexpected places thanks to divergent thinking. This mode of thought links ideas based on associative memory and new concepts. It encourages spontaneous, free-flowing thinking that entertains multiple solutions to a problem. That might sound difficult, and it can take time to train your brain to think this way, but there are techniques you can use to develop the ability for divergent thinking. Synectics exercises train you to find connections between concepts, objects, or ideas that seem unrelated. To begin, choose any two things, like a lamp and box of tissues, and write down as many associations as you can think of. For example, you could find both items in an office, and you could make a lamp shade with tissues. Repeat this exercise everyday with new items. The SCAMPER technique is a creative brainstorming approach that puts an existing idea through a set of filters: Substitute : What part of this process or idea can be substituted or replaced? Combine: Can you combine two or more components? Adapt : What else could you do, or how could you adjust, the existing idea? Modify : What changes could you make to get better results? Put to another use : How could this idea solve other problems? Eliminate : What would happen if you removed XYZ? Reverse : How could you rearrange the current status or workflow? Step 2: Lay the groundwork and capture all your ideas While divergent thinking can help your brain find unexpected relationships, convergent thinking is the process of evaluating and refining your options, to help you select and develop the most promising ones. Both are fundamental to the creative process. The connections you make will only be as good as the inputs: your ideas, thoughts, observations, and notes. It’s important then to capture everything, so you can graduate from making connections between two random objects to finding an inspired connection between two previously unrelated ideas. Develop the habit of getting your ideas out of your head and into a note. Write down all those half-baked ideas that come to you when you’re in the shower or on a walk. Save words, drawings, images, or photos that speak to you—you don’t need to have a plan for them or even understand why they inspire you. You can make those connections later. Start by creating an “Ideas” notebook in Evernote to capture all your divergent thinking ideas, then set aside a dedicated block of time once a week for some convergent thinking. Go through your notebook deliberately. Do any ideas stand out? Flag them for further development. And even if an idea doesn’t immediately seem to fit, or sounds crazy, that doesn’t mean it won’t eventually come in handy. Leave it there and let your divergent mind keep searching for that elusive spark. Pro tip: Use tags in Evernote to organize your ideas by keywords such as categories, memories, or locations. Step 3: Introduce the unexpected Inspiration can strike at any time. You may be watching a movie, talking to your neighbor, or listening to your favorite song, but in the background, your brain is busy making connections between the seemingly random activity and all your growing ideas. As you train your brain to more easily see these relationships, and accumulate a library of ideas and notes, it’s time to introduce unexpected elements to jump-start your creativity and inspiration. The key is to really focus on the unexpected . It may feel awkward or uncomfortable to go off in a completely different direction, or it may just feel like a waste of time. But the more diverse your experiences are, the more likely you are to innovate. You can introduce the unexpected by: Reading history. Seeing how others have dealt with difficult problems can show us new solutions, even if the details seem very different. Starting a new hobby. Novelty stimulates the reward center of our brains, which can improve memory and motivate us to explore further. Listening to music. ‘Happy’ music, such as Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons,” offers a mild diversion that relaxes our focus and encourages divergent thinking. Talking to someone new. Chatting with a stranger—or someone we don’t know well—forces us to think in new ways instead of relying on habitual responses. Pro tip: Save and annotate PDFs and other content in Evernote to keep track of your thoughts and reactions as you are exposed to the unexpected. Bonus: Make connections as a team These approaches are designed to help you train your own mind, but you can also use them to make connections as a team—especially during creative brainstorming sessions. Traditionally, group brainstorming can lead to dozens of one-off ideas that don’t relate to each other. By combining the methods above, you can guide everyone toward a shared goal, building upon everyone’s ideas and finding unexpected connections. The easiest way to introduce divergent thinking to your team is with brainwriting , where each person writes down his or her ideas on a piece of paper—anonymously—and team members have the opportunity to comment or build on those ideas. There are a number of variations of brainwriting, including: Interactive brainwriting : Instead of simply collecting idea cards, you pass them to other members of the team. Team members can add comments or additional ideas to the note before passing it to the next person. 6-3-5 brainwriting : In this approach, groups of six generate three ideas per round, with each round lasting five minutes. In the first round, everyone writes down three quick ideas on a piece of paper. In round two, you pass your paper to the person sitting next to you, who reads the first set of ideas and adds another set of three below. In rounds three, four, five, and six, you continue passing your piece of paper and adding new and/or improved ideas to the papers you receive. Once you get your own piece of paper back, the process is complete. Collaborative brainwriting: With collaborative brainwriting, you hang a large piece of paper on a wall with markers nearby. Write the question, problem, or prompt on the paper and invite team members to jot down their ideas when they feel inspired. They can also comment or build on ideas that are already written down. Pro Tip: Save a picture of your collaborative brainwriting in Evernote, then share it with the team for later review or reference. The power of connections Knowledge alone isn’t enough to spark creativity. The secret to unlocking inspiration, and seeing the world through different eyes, is making new connections between the pieces of information you already have. So, the next time you’re working on a project or coming up with the next big thing, just remember: you’re closer to a creative breakthrough than you think. Sometimes all you need is a little dose of the unexpected.", "date": "2020-05-21,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Self-Care Tips for Parents: Taking “Alone Time” to Recharge", "author": ["Elizabeth Saunders"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/self-care-tips-for-parents/", "abstract": "2020 has been a year of upheaval for all of us, but with added stresses including uncertain finances, schools closing, and restless kids stuck at home, being a parent during this time can be particularly challenging. Perhaps you keep hearing about people binging on Netflix, and think: “ How do these people have so much free time?? I’m busier than ever! ” And it’s true. While many people find social distancing extraordinarily difficult because of the lack of in-person contact, parents are having the opposite issue. They likely have too much in-person contact throughout the day, with no break from anyone else in the family. School, activities, work, or going to friends’ houses are all off the table. That means there’s no natural barrier, time to recharge, or even answer text messages, unless you intentionally take it. Dismissing your alone time can lead to additional stress and, in extreme cases, parental burnout. Thankfully, taking active steps to practice self-care isn’t as difficult as you may think. As a time management coach, I’ve been working with my clients on how to manage change and stay sane. Here are my top five tips on how to give yourself time and space to recharge as a parent right now. Think About What You Want Different individuals have different activities that help them thrive. An important part of practicing self-care is understanding what activities are soothing to you. Start to make a list in Evernote of what you would really like to do and can still do in this current environment. That could include: Exercise Read Talk with friends Do artistic hobbies Start journaling Organize your home Take a nap Think through what kinds of activities you really find yourself longing to do. If your brain is too fried to organize your thoughts right now, that’s OK. Think back to the things you used to enjoy doing to recharge before your situation changed. Are there things you may have dropped from your schedule? Can you start doing them again? Define your specific next steps Once you’ve clarified what you need to feel healthier and happier in general, you can start to define specific next steps by digging down within each item in your note. For example, under “exercise,” you could list ideas such as: Walking around the neighborhood Following a 20-minute exercise video on YouTube Taking a virtual class Under “reading,” you could list a few books you’ve been meaning to start. And under “talking with friends,” you might list out a few specific friends and family members to call. The idea is that by having a very clearly defined next step, it makes it easier to take action. Pick a treat for each day To give yourself something to look forward to and to stay away from the feeling of resentment that you’re always doing things for everyone else, approach the list you’ve created as a set of “me-time” treats, and pick one each day as a way to unwind and reward yourself. It could look like going on a walk, taking a nap, calling a friend, etc. Define what you want to do and then look for opportunities to do that thing. Make it a goal to do at least one thing every day that you find refreshing. Communicate your boundaries If you need support from other people in your home to do these activities, ask for it. Maybe that means having your spouse watch the kids while you go on a walk alone. Or telling your kids that you’re going to be on the phone with your friend in your bedroom and to only interrupt you if it’s an absolute emergency. It’s not wrong or bad to communicate when you need space—in fact, it’s essential. Just because it’s called “self-care” doesn’t mean you should be expected to do everything yourself. Support others’ need to recharge While you’re asking for the support you need to refresh and recharge each day, don’t forget to actively give that same support to others. If you know your husband or wife could really use some introverted time, offer to be responsible for the kids for the evening. Or, if one of your kids needs some space to practice their singing, give it to them. The more we honor and respect one another’s needs to refresh and recharge, the less often arguments will erupt simply because people in your household need space. When movement is restricted, it can be really difficult for parents to create the space they need to practice self-care and recharge. But know that you’re not alone in these challenges, and it is possible—and necessary—to solve some of them with a little thought and intention.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "5 Ways to Get Organized and Think Clearly", "author": ["Emily Esposito"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-to-get-organized/", "abstract": "The Costs of Being Unorganized Being unorganized has bigger consequences than misplacing the remote control or forgetting to respond to an email. First, it’s expensive. A 2017 survey found we spend a total of 2.5 days a year looking for misplaced items, such as phones, keys, and, yes, remotes. Replacing lost items costs Americans $2.7 billion each year, and more than half are regularly late for work or school due to frustrating searches. Second, disorganization can have a major impact on your emotional well-being. Data shows people who describe their homes as “cluttered” or full of “unfinished projects” are more depressed and fatigued, and have higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol than those who say their homes are “restful” and “restorative.” And if you’re working from home or unemployed, the impact of clutter is compounded because you’re constantly around it. While the pitfalls are clear, there’s not always a straightforward approach to being more organized. You could get rid of items that don’t spark joy, but you may inadvertently place too much attention on the number of things you have versus organizing and using those items in a way that improves productivity. It’s also not always about the physical items—your digital life, like the apps you use and the files you create, can lead to disarray. Five ways to organize your professional and personal life The ultimate goal is to organize your life to help you find calm and think more clearly. This will look different for everyone; some thrive on simplicity and minimalism, while others find order in color-coded labels and consistency. Experiment with different approaches to see what resonates with you. Here are five methods you can try: Create standard naming conventions for labels and digital files We’re all guilty of creating meaningless note or file names like “draft_V6” or “ideas.” In isolation, these vague file names don’t do much harm. But when you multiply this habit by the hundreds or thousands, you can quickly find yourself unable to locate a certain document, trying to decipher search results that all look alike, or wasting time opening dozens of notes to find the right one. Establishing standard naming conventions keeps you and your digital workspace organized. These naming conventions don’t need to be intimidating or burdensome; instead, focus on adding as much detail as you can to the title or file name. You could organize your files by project title, type, team member name or initials, or date. For example, instead of “draft_V6,” you could add the date, draft title, and author name: “04012020_HowtoStayOrganized_EmilyEsposito.” Find a format that works for you, and stick with it. If you’re working with a team, get buy-in from everyone and apply your naming conventions to notebooks or folder hierarchy as well, to make sure everything is organized. For example, you could create shared Google Drive directories like client > year > project, or use a combination of notebooks and tags in Evernote, so anyone on your team could easily find a 2018 writing project for XYZ client. Pro tips: Special characters (like @, #, !) will sort before numbers (0-9), which will sort before letters. Using a special character at the start of your most important notes ensures they always appear at the top of your note list. If sorting by date is helpful to you, use a YYYY-MM-DD date format so alphabetical order is the same as date order. Leverage automation to connect information between apps Throughout the day, you constantly jump between apps that each hold their own set of information. In fact, employees in one study switched between as many as 35 job-critical apps more than 1,100 times each day . This pattern not only impacts your productivity, it also increases the chances of losing information or having too much data siloed in certain apps. The result? Keeping track of which tasks are completed in which app not only clutters your digital workflows, it also clutters your mind. Tools like Zapier and IFTTT can help you connect your favorite apps, so information automatically flows between each one. With Zapier, you can search for apps ( like Evernote ), and choose from a list of “Zaps” (pre-made integrations), or create your own workflow. For example, you could send Dropbox files to Evernote or create Trello cards from new notes in Evernote. IFTTT also lets you search for pre-built integrations, called Applets, or create your own. To extend Evernote , create Google Calendar events based on new Evernote reminders, or add new WordPress posts to Evernote so you can keep everything in one place. Optimize your desk space Your desk can quickly become a catchall for clutter, accumulating pieces of paper, Post-it® Notes, pens, and snacks. While all these items serve a purpose, how you organize and display them has a big impact on how you work. The more cluttered your desk, the more stressed and anxious you’ll feel. Don’t assume that a bare desk is best, though. Your optimal desk setup depends entirely on you. For example, “someone who is a very visual processor would not do well if everything was put away out of sight,” said Jennifer Truesdale, owner of STR8N Up Professional Organizing Services , in an article from Money.com . If you need visual clues, keep your documents and supplies out on your desk, but use a color-coded system so you can keep track of your work at a glance. Another way to organize your desk is to think about your daily workflow. Identify the three to five items you use most regularly and place them within reach. Everything else can be stored or put away. Or have your desk mirror our natural tendency for linear processing. Place “incoming items,” like your computer or phone, on the left and leave an empty workspace in the middle. Place outgoing items like staplers and completed paperwork on the right. Try different arrangements until you find one that feels intuitive and streamlined for how you work and process information. Reduce waste and clutter by going paperless Although the world recently celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of Earth Day , there is still more we can do to reduce paper waste. Our lives are increasingly digital, yet paper remains a modern reality. The average office worker uses 10,000 sheets of paper each year , and while some of it does get recycled, a large majority sits in your filing cabinet or on your desk. When your coworker asks to see a printed document, you don’t have the luxury of using the “Ctrl + F” shortcut to locate the right one. Go paperless to save time searching for information and declutter your physical space. Before you begin, audit what you currently have. Critically evaluate what you need to keep and what you can recycle. This chart is a great place to start: The goal is to transform as many paper documents into digital files as you can. You may need to keep important paper documents on file (like legal documents), but you can still digitize them so you have a secure back-up copy. Once you’ve tackled your current pile of paper, make a plan to go paperless in the future. It will take time to establish this new habit, but an easy way to start practicing is with meetings. Rather than printing presentations, documents, and meeting agendas, move everything to a note in Evernote. Attach presentation files and supporting documents directly to the note and share with your team. Pro tip: Scanning paper files into Evernote is as simple as using your smartphone’s camera. While in the Evernote app, tap the camera icon and point your device at the item you want to scan . Make organization a habit Think of how organized you are after you move to a new home or office, or after you dedicate an afternoon to streamlining your digital life. A few months later, you probably notice the same culprits: a cluttered desk, organizational systems no longer being used, or file names going haywire. This is completely normal, but you need a plan in place to keep yourself organized. These tips aren’t just one-off strategies; they should be incorporated into your routine on a regular basis. Make time for organization like you would for a meeting or big event. Block off ten minutes at the end of each day and set a reminder to clean up your digital and physical space, or leave an hour on Fridays to focus on organization. You could: Walk around your work space or home to gather any loose items lying around. Place those items in your physical inbox or scan them to Evernote. Clean off your computer desktop, clean out the downloads folder, and empty the trash. Look at all your digital inboxes (places you receive new information, like your email or Evernote) and archive, delete, or move things to specific folders. Pro tip : Use the GTD Weekly Review Template to keep you on track. Simplicity leads to clearer thinking Organizing your life doesn’t simply mean decluttering. While that is one aspect, you should take a more holistic approach. Consider what you need in order to find calm and think more clearly, and apply that to your physical space, workflows, apps, and digital files. And remember, you don’t necessarily need to throw everything away. If you want to keep something, just make sure it is presented in a way that makes sense for you to do your best work.", "date": "2020-04-29,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "4 Ways to Stay Focused and Get Stuff Done", "author": ["Emily Esposito"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/stay-focused-get-stuff-done/", "abstract": "You grab a cup of coffee, turn on your laptop, and take a deep breath; it’s time to focus. You open a blank note to start writing a project plan, and rather than wrapping up a first draft in the usual hour or two, you find yourself on social media, checking your phone, or simply zoning out. If you’re distracted by the current newscycle, adapting to working in a new place (or working from home for the first time!), or trying to calm your worries, it can feel impossible to concentrate on work. But the goal in times of uncertainty isn’t to match your peak productivity levels. Instead, it’s about finding pockets throughout the day that are more conducive to focusing, and gradually reducing distractions. Here are four ways to stay on task and get your work done. 1. Train your mind to ignore distractions When you need to focus for long periods of time, less is more. That’s according to studies by Joe DeGutis and Mike Esterman from the Boston Attention and Learning Lab who found that the most effective way to get things done was to focus for a bit, then take a short break before going back to concentrating. This is the science behind The Pomodoro Technique , a time-management method where you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. Each work interval is referred to as a pomodoro, and once you’ve finished four pomodoros, you take a longer break of 20 or 30 minutes. While this sounds easy in practice, distractions can still find a way to creep into your work, even within a 25-minute time block. Stacey Harmon, an Evernote Certified Consultant and Getting Things DoneⓇ (GTD) practitioner, recently released a training video on how to focus in uncertain times using The Pomodoro Technique , including how to reduce the number of distractions during each pomodoro. Stacey says the best way to combat distractions is to first understand if they are internal or external. Internal distractions are made up of your own ideas and thoughts, like when you sit down to do work but suddenly feel the urge to check your email or look up something on the internet. You can avoid wasting your pomodoro by making this distraction visible and writing it down. By capturing your distractions, you’ll be able to clear your mind to focus on the task at hand. External distractions are when you are interrupted by others, like a coworker needing help on a project or a friend sending you a text. Because your goal is to reach the end of the pomodoro, you should take a few seconds to deal with the interruption and go back to focusing. Stacey recommends saying something like, “I’m in the middle of a pomodoro, I’ll get back to you in 25 minutes” or “I’m not in a spot where I can respond right now.” Over time, you’ll be able to train your brain to complete the full 25 minutes of continuous work without any internal or external interruptions. Pro tip: Use this Evernote template to capture your Pomodoro tasks. 2. Schedule tasks around your ultradian rhythm Your ability to focus fluctuates throughout the day and week. There will be times when you can quickly write that email or finish that project, and others when it feels so unnatural and challenging to sit down and get work done. While you can’t (and shouldn’t) eliminate the less productive times in your day, there is a way to recognize when you’re most likely to be at your best , and optimize it. We all run on a 24-hour internal “clock,” referred to as our circadian rhythm. This dictates when we go to sleep, wake up, and experience peak levels of energy. Within that 24-hour day, we cycle through 90-minute blocks of productivity and heightened focus, known as our ultradian rhythm. To understand your own ultradian rhythm, record your levels of focus, enthusiasm, and energy at the same times each day at hourly intervals. Make sure to add a note describing any changes to your daily routine (like if you took a mid-day walk). After a week or two of data gathering, you’ll start to see a pattern emerge. You’ll be able to pinpoint when your focus and energy are at their highest and lowest, and match your tasks accordingly. For example, save your most creative, strategic projects for when you feel most focused. Then, work on your more manual, admin-like tasks when you have less energy and are more easily distracted. Pro tip: Use this Evernote template to track your levels of focus, enthusiasm, and energy. 3. Make time for zoning out Many productivity strategies teach you how to quiet the mind and stop it from wandering. While it may seem counterintuitive, a more efficient approach is to encourage daydreaming—at predetermined times. Paul Seli, a psychologist at Harvard University, has identified two types of daydreaming : deliberate and accidental mind wandering. He says that only accidental mind wandering harms productivity, and that people who carve out time for deliberate mind wandering—while doing mindless tasks, for example—suffer less than those who find themselves daydreaming randomly throughout the day. “If the task is easy, intentionally mind wandering will likely not result in performance costs, but it should afford people the opportunity to reap the benefits of mind wandering, such as problem-solving and planning,” Paul says in a BBC article . What does this mean for you? Allow yourself 10 to 15 minutes each day to zone out, but choose this window of time carefully. Perhaps you choose to let your mind wander while cleaning your desk after lunch or going on a walk to get coffee. This way, you’ll be less likely to daydream during deep work or important meetings. Pro tip: Schedule a time for deliberate mind wandering, then set a reminder in Evernote. 4. Choose the right work location Stepping into a different space hits the reset button on your brain and allows for more productive and creative thinking. Daniel J. Levitin One of the easiest ways to change your behavior is to change your environment . For example, if you want to sit less during the day, buy a standing desk for your office. Or, if you want to improve your focus, work in the right location. “One way to exploit the hippocampus’s natural style of memory storage is to create different work spaces for the different kinds of work we do … If you’re working on two completely separate projects, dedicate one desk or table or section of the house for each. Just stepping into a different space hits the reset button on your brain and allows for more productive and creative thinking,” wrote Daniel J. Levitin in his book, “ The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload .” For example, if you’re working from home, you’ll have more luck concentrating on tasks in a dedicated office versus sitting on the living room couch, where you usually watch TV. If you don’t have a home office, contextual clues can make a shared space feel different. Let’s say you have to work at your dining room table. You can focus on rearranging the environment to feel new, like putting away your centerpiece and any plates or glasses, and replacing them with visual clues that signal focus—like your work notebooks, an office plant, or an external monitor. The key is to put away these things when you’re done working to make sure these contextual clues are only associated with focus and concentration. Pro tip: Take a picture or create a checklist of the items in your ‘work space.’ That’ll make it easier to get set up each day, and get down to work. Staying focused during times of unpredictability Getting work done is never only about the work itself. Sure, your ability to complete tasks depends on how simple or complex they are, but it also depends on your mood, your environment, and what’s happening around you. When things are especially stressful and changing at a rapid pace, look for small ways to stay on task. Try one new strategy each week and keep track of what works and doesn’t work for you. And, as you’re adapting to a new way of working, remember to celebrate the times you do find focus.", "date": "2020-04-2,"},

It’s Not All About You", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/the-secret-to-remote-work/", "abstract": "You’re at a holiday party, and invariably, someone asks what you do. You respond, explaining that you work remotely. Cue the raised eyebrows and polite nods. That’s because when remote work gets mentioned, it can conjure up all kinds of notions. People working in their pajamas. Workers slacking off. A disconnected, maybe even dysfunctional team culture. Some people still have this idea that you need to be sitting in an office from 9-5 to get things done. A few companies such as IBM are even bringing all remote workers back into the fold of the office. But then there are other companies like GitLab , Buffer , and Zapier , which are ‘remote only,’ with everyone working out in the wild. They find a range of benefits, including the extra flexibility and increased productivity that comes from avoiding a commute and covering more time zones (not to mention the work-life balance for employees and the overhead savings for the company). Most companies aren’t fully remote yet. But we all experience remote work and collaboration in some way , whether we have an occasional ‘WFH day’ or work virtually with teammates and other offices that are scattered across the globe. In fact, a 2015 survey found that 37 percent of US workers have fulfilled their job duties from somewhere other than an office, compared to just 9 percent in 1995. Remote work isn’t just about your individual productivity… you’ve got to figure out how to work together as a remote team. As remote work becomes part of the fabric of our working lives, we need to find ways of embracing it and making it better . The first step on that journey is remembering that remote work isn’t just about your individual productivity when you’re not in an office—you’ve also got to figure out how to work together as a remote or virtual team. So we’ve rounded up some tips so individuals and teams can make the best out of remote work. Tips for productivity outside of the office Create some boundaries. Even if you don’t have the space for a home office, it’s important to carve out a dedicated workspace. If you work from the comfort of your bed, it may be more tempting to take that nap. (It may also make it more difficult to fall asleep when it’s time for bed). Set up a routine. When you don’t have to commute, you get precious time back in your day. But with extra (and more flexible) hours, you still need to be thoughtful about how you structure your day. Adopting a routine can make you more productive and creative. Take breaks. It can be hard to ‘switch off’ when your work and life are happening in the same place. But it’s important to remember that you can and you should take breaks. Avoid cabin fever by hitting the gym, taking the dog out, or grabbing coffee. Share your status. Whether it’s through scheduled check-ins or just by updating your status on the chat tool, make sure you’re communicating with the rest of your team. If you go offline, provide extra context around why and when you’ll back in an away message. Make video your friend. You may be tempted not to show your face (especially if you haven’t changed out of your pajamas) but when you can, try having video meetings instead of just calls. Face-to-face interaction leads to tons of non-verbal cues. Without video, you’re missing out on all those signals—and your chance to build relationships. Be considerate of time zones. If you have a teammate in Europe who’s always staying late for your weekly calls, offer to rotate the meeting time so you can share the inconvenience that comes from working in different time zones. Get more tips for boosting your productivity when you’re working from home » Tips for making a remote team work Set some ground rules for team communication. At an in-person or virtual team meeting, come together to decide on a ‘team charter’ for communication. Figure out in what situations you all should use video conference, phone calls, chat, or email, and set a preference order. Agree on some ground rules, such as ‘no blind cc’s in emails’ so everyone’s clear on what not to do. It’s important that this is a joint effort, with team-wide input (not just a directive handed down from the leader). Check in with the team. Hold team-wide video-conference meetings if it’s possible. See everyone’s faces and allow time for casual conversation to help build those personal relationships and team bonds. If you’re a leader, you need to mentor, develop, and sometimes have tough conversations with the people you lead, all remotely. Set up regular one-on-one video meetings with your direct reports. Try to give feedback in that setting instead of via email, which can be misinterpreted . Hire good communicators. When hiring we often focus on specific skills, previous experience, and cultural fit. But when you’re building a remote team, you have to assess virtual skills as well. Remote work requires good listening, communication, and collaboration skills. Talk to candidates the same way you’ll talk to them on the job throughout the interview process: in person, by phone, on video, and via email.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Best Office Isn’t a Building, It’s a Space", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/best-office-is-a-space/", "abstract": "In September 1983, an ambitious 30-year-old computer engineer named Steve Roberts embarked on a unique journey : a 17,000-mile trek across America. But while the pioneers of the past were equipped with horses, wagons, and tents, Steve set out aboard ‘Winnebiko,’ a “custom recumbent bicycle with a solar-powered portable computer (the venerable Radio Shack Model 100 ), a CompuServe account, and a base office.” Along the way, he used this mobile workstation to write a book, Computing Across America , as well as columns and feature pieces chronicling his adventures for various magazines. Steve’s journey foreshadowed a day when, armed with technology, it would be possible to not just work from home, but work from anywhere . In doing so, he became the first of a new breed of worker: the “digital nomad.” It’s a lot easier today to work from anywhere than it was in 1983. Most of us now carry in our pockets a device thousands of times more powerful than Steve’s computer. We have access to virtually all the world’s information, and connection speeds so fast that, for many knowledge workers, there is now no practical restriction on where they can work. All they require is an electrical outlet and a reliable Wi-Fi connection. You may not consider yourself a true digital nomad, but chances are high that you engage in remote work—at least sometimes. Perhaps you’re a salesperson who’s on the road, meeting with prospects and clients, or maybe you just have a regular “work from home” day. Either way, it’s clear that remote work is on the rise. In fact, a 2017 study by Global Workplace Analytics and FlexJobs found that 3.9 million U.S. employees, or nearly three percent of the total workforce, worked remotely at least half of the time, up from 1.8 million in 2005. Despite this popularity, however, remote work presents a challenge for employees and employers alike. Without the ability to gather an entire team in one physical location, companies run the risk that their digital nomads will feel unsupported, aimless, and out of the loop. As a result, they can lose morale as they find it difficult to see how their efforts are contributing to the overall team. Here are a few tips for supporting remote workers and giving them the tools to bring their best selves to work for your company: Create a virtual office As Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub says , “If you’re going to have a distributed team, you’d better figure out what your real office is.” And remember that your team’s office doesn’t have to be a physical space. Thanks to chat tools like Slack , you can create a virtual office for your team and still work effectively. Along with a place to meet and discuss ideas, your digital nomads also need a virtual whiteboard, where they can collaborate on plans and projects, compare notes, and share ideas. With Spaces in Evernote Business , you can invite team members to view, edit, and create notes that the whole team can access. This gives everyone, regardless of their location, a chance to contribute their work to the overall team effort. Another tip is to stream company “all-hands” meetings online (as we do here at Evernote), or make recordings of them available, so that remote workers can hear the important issues facing the company first-hand. And while many folks may enjoy the experience of working remotely, they can often miss the social aspect of being part of a team. Arrange a series of “ virtual speed dating ” video calls, where team members can get to know each other individually, and consider scheduling regular “virtual happy hours,” where the entire team can join a video conference for the sole purpose of socializing —alcoholic beverages optional! Start a free trial of Evernote Business » Be mindful of time zones Walt Disney was right: it really is a small world after all. Many U.S. companies today are focusing their attention worldwide, as they expand into new markets in Asia and Europe. Software companies in particular, since they don’t have the same concerns around manufacturing and distributing a physical product, have become truly global businesses. But when dealing with teams that are distributed around the globe, be mindful of the local time. That might mean alternating meetings between early morning and late afternoon, so that the burden of inconvenient meeting times is shared equally. Or consider whether you really need to have that meeting at all. Can it be handled via email? Or can you collaborate another way? For example, you can use a space in Evernote Business to create a shared note for discussion topics, then invite your digital nomads to add their input during their normal office hours. Communicate openly, communicate often One of the biggest challenges for remote workers is staying on top of what is happening with the team and with the company overall. This is true whether they’re working from home, at a conference or event, or meeting with clients. It is all too easy for digital nomads to miss important updates, leading them to feel ‘out of the loop’ and that they’ve lost sight of the big picture. You can ease some of this pain by ensuring that you keep the lines of communication open. Make it clear that you are available to talk should your remote team members have any questions. Schedule regular check-ins (preferably by video) with remote workers to give them a chance to raise any concerns and blockers that they may have. You can also use that time to share team updates, goals, and expectations with them—this will give them clarity into what they should be focusing on, and why. The “What’s new” and “Pinned notes” features at the top of a space in Evernote Business can go a long way toward providing much-needed transparency for remote workers. Highlighting changes to a space ensures that your digital nomads don’t miss any important project updates, while pinning important notes means that relevant information is always in view. This makes it easy for them to create their best work, no matter where they are. Remote work can be highly rewarding for both employees and companies, but it demands an employer that is mindful of the challenges and proactive in its support. With appropriate planning, remote work can give your digital nomads the space to be productive and valuable contributors, whether they’re in the building next door or on the other side of the world.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Ever Better Challenge, Part 1: Build a Plan, Change a Habit", "author": ["Brian Daignault"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/ever-better-challenge-build-plan/", "abstract": "I’m typing this on Monday morning, although I suppose that’s not a very meaningful detail. How about: I’m typing this on Monday morning—without the aid of the chocolate-hazelnut croissant I treat myself to at the beginning of each week. Why? Because today is the first day of my Ever Better Challenge , which is no desserts for 30 days in the hope of losing a little weight. (You might be thinking that desserts can only occur after lunch or dinner and that a croissant is simply an unhealthy breakfast choice. But, if I make that distinction, I’ll just front-load my day with cupcakes to exploit the loophole.) Taking on this challenge will not be easy. In fact, research shows most people who make yearly goals fail to achieve them. Why do so many people fail? They set big goals without planning how to achieve them. They don’t have systems set up to track their progress, hold themselves accountable, or get support when they stumble. And they expect instant results when they should be focusing on gradual day-to-day progress. #EverBetterChallenge That insight inspired the creative team at Evernote to design the Ever Better Challenge to help you finish what you start. Because having a goal and relying on willpower isn’t enough; you need a plan and a structure to support it. We created a helpful set of templates to get you started, some “infotaining” videos to guide you along the way, and this series of blogs from yours truly; I’ll be writing about my experience with the challenge while also giving some tips to help you with yours. A disclaimer Success is not assured. If you’re nervous about your challenge, I hope it’s of some comfort to know that I am as well. Build a plan I’ve tried to give up desserts before, but I didn’t put a framework in place to actually quit—which is perhaps why I didn’t succeed. The Ever Better Challenge features four templates to guide you from start to finish. The first, Build a Plan , provides a foundation for the program. To begin, identify a goal—one thing you want to change about yourself and your life. Choosing a goal (just one) isn’t easy, but it’s an important decision. You want to make sure the goal you choose is reasonable, achievable, and realistic. For me, I want to lose a little weight, maybe five pounds. I have some awesome old shirts I almost don’t fit into anymore that I want to wear again. That’s my goal. You will have your own, and with that goal in mind, the next step is to target a habit you can build or curb that will help you get there. James Clear has some great advice on how to choose a habit that makes sense. Speaking of habits… Track your habit A person can love something without consuming it on a daily basis, so it’s important to note here that—more than loving desserts— I’ve habituated myself to eating them . Honestly, there are meals I eat only to justify the dessert that will follow. To change a habit, you have to do things differently. Our Habit Tracker template is a great resource to identify and track your new behavior. For my goal of losing weight, cutting out desserts makes sense. It has a direct correlation to what I want to change and how to change it. The Habit Tracker allows me to record my progress. For each day without dessert, I place an “X” in the corresponding box. People love checking off boxes . It’s a strategy that helps people meet their goals because it’s a fun, interactive, and visual way to measure progress that provides a sense of accomplishment. It’s also simple, and that’s important. Ask for support Accountability is another strategy that has proven to be successful when making changes. We do better when we’re not in it alone. Designating an “accountability buddy” increases the chances of getting something done. Our Support Network template will help you create a network that you can be accountable to, that will support you as you go—and that you can reach out to if you have a setback. Deal with setbacks OK…you might not like this, and perhaps I shouldn’t even write it—but it’s possible we’ll experience a setback at some point over this 30-day challenge. We might not do that thing we were going to do every day—or, we might do that thing we weren’t going to do (like eat dessert). While I don’t want to set us up for failure (or give us an easy way out), it’s also important to recognize these things happen. Because all is not lost if— if— we experience a setback; we can even turn setbacks into comebacks . Self-compassion is OK If I slip up and eat some frozen yogurt next week, the worst thing I can do is be negative toward myself and give up. If my goal is not to eat dessert for 30 days, but I end up not eating dessert for 28 or 29 days, I still succeeded. After all, a goal can be something reached or something to aim toward. If a slip up occurs, let’s be kind to ourselves ; not only do we deserve it, but we’re also more likely to keep going instead of giving up completely. Reflect and correct Also, speaking of “keep going,” we built a template that can be used as a weekly check-in to make sure we’re keeping up with what is working and steering away from what isn’t. Using the Reflect and Correct template is a great way to track what is happening in the challenge—and as a diary for future challenges. Because this isn’t the first or last challenge we’ll face. Each success prepares us with confidence for the next and, if you use these templates, you’ll have a helpful reference resource to guide you as well. Take the first steps Okay, you’ve identified your goal, the habit you’re going to change, your accountability buddy, and how to deal with setbacks. Now it’s time to get started. For me, starting means no croissant. As I’ve written this today, I’ve probably thought about that croissant a hundred times. As well as the peppermint bark I turned down after lunch. This challenge is already…challenging. Remember your motivation Why am I doing this? Oh yeah, to lose a little weight and prove to myself I can. Overcoming a challenge like this is sure to boost my confidence , allowing me to take on other difficult things in my life. First things first though—29 more days without dessert! I’ll keep you posted on how my challenge goes with these weekly blogs. Let us know how your challenge is going in our Ever Better Challenge Facebook Group . A footnote about this challenge New Year’s is usually a time when people cast a new vision for themselves, but resolutions can be a loaded term, and very specific to that time of year. You can take on a new goal anytime. So, this challenge was designed to be used anytime and beginning at any point in a month; you can start on April 23 as easily as January 1. Whenever you get started, we’ll be here. For more information on how to save templates, click here .", "date": "2018-12-27,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "12 Powerful Stress-Busting Tips You Need to Know", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/12-powerful-stress-busting-tips/", "abstract": "If you’ve ever tried yoga or guided meditation, you know the routine: Before you begin, you close your eyes, check in with your body, and breathe. This simple exercise helps you recognize where you’re carrying stress and, by identifying it, begin to eliminate it. The act of awareness puts you back in control. So, stop what you’re doing right now, close your eyes, and just… breathe. How stressed do you feel? If you said “very,” you’re not alone. A recent Gallup survey found that 55 percent of Americans feel stress during most of their day. And while that number is higher in the U.S. than in most other countries, it’s clearly a global problem. These days it’s easy to feel like the world is spinning out of control. And lack of control—that feeling of powerlessness—is one of the biggest causes of stress in your life. As a result, you’re less happy, less healthy, and less productive than you know you can be. How can you flip the script? What can you do right now to make 2020 the year you reduce stress, reclaim control, and remove the barriers standing between you and what you want to achieve? Bring the focus in As humans, we tend to focus on bad news . It makes sense; your brain is wired to spot (and hopefully avoid) danger. As a consequence, you pay more attention to what’s happening around you than what’s happening inside you. While you may not be able to change the whole world (although more power to you if you can), you have more control over your life—meaning the factors that directly affect you—than you realize. Start by letting go of what you can’t control, and bring the focus in to the one thing you can control: you. Sadly, many people don’t try to change or even avoid negative situations for the simple reason that they feel powerless. Three areas, in particular, where most people say they’d like to make a change but feel unable to are: health, finances, and career. Not coincidentally, these are the three areas where you have the greatest potential for action. The key is to take one small step today. Your journey to self-awareness, growth, and accomplishment starts now. Just choose your path, take a deep breath, and begin. I want to reduce stress around my: Health Finances Career De-stress your health At the start of each year, goals like losing weight, quitting smoking or drinking, and exercising more appear on countless lists of New Year’s resolutions . Clearly, we’d all like to be a little healthier. So why do 92 percent of resolutions ultimately fail? The problem is that the goals you set may be too vague . It comes back to control. If you don’t clearly define what your goal is, you’ll never know when you’ve accomplished it. That uncertainty causes you to feel powerless and out of control, leaving you stressed and unhappy. This raises the level of cortisol in your body which, among other things, increases your appetite and pushes you to overeat. And so the cycle begins. You can reclaim control by being specific. What does a specific goal look like? “I want to lose weight” is not specific. “I want to lose 10 pounds by July 1st” is. The more clearly you can define and quantify your goal, the easier it will be for you to stay on target. Here are some things you can do today to get started: Use Evernote’s Get Fit template to track your progress toward your exercise and nutrition goals. Habit tracking is a powerful tool that many people, including comedian Jerry Seinfeld , have used to help them stay focused. Keep a journal to record the things that cause you stress, and your reactions to them. Like deep breathing, this can help you identify (and change) stress-inducing patterns that negatively impact your health. Use Web Clipper to save healthy recipes you find online. Tag them by ingredients, occasion, or style to find them easily later. Create a meal plan and shopping list for the week in Evernote. Pro tip: Share a public link to your Get Fit template with family and friends so they can see your progress and cheer you on. De-stress your finances You can debate whether or not money is actually “the root of all evil,” but it’s hard to deny it’s a major cause of stress. It seems there’s almost no income level that is completely immune to the effects of financial anxiety. If you ask someone earning $20,000 a year how much they would need to live stress-free, they might say “$100,000.” But ask someone earning $100,000 and they might say “$250,000.” Someone earning that income would no doubt mention a higher number still. And so it goes. Surprisingly, researchers have found that the actual dollar amount is not what’s important. Sure, being able to meet your basic needs (food, clothing, shelter) is a given, but beyond that, the key is “the ways in which you are able to direct your income to purposes that are likely to bring you happiness and satisfaction.” In other words, having the power to take control and spend your money how you want to. You can reclaim control by deciding where your money goes. The road to financial freedom is long. But regardless of your income, you can make it easier by tracking your spending now. Once you have awareness into where your money is going, you can decide what matters most and start to make changes that put you back in control. Here are some things you can do today: Create a budget with Evernote’s Save Money template , and set aside a little extra each month to save or pay off debt. Set reminders for bills and other money-related tasks you need to complete. Use your phone’s camera to take pictures of bills and receipts. Save them in Evernote and add tags to sort them by expense category. Make comparison shopping easier by creating tables in Evernote. Enter prices from different retailers and compare them side-by-side to make sure you get the best deal. Pro tip: Share your Save Money template with your spouse, or anyone else with whom you share financial goals or responsibilities, so you’re both on the same page. De-stress your career Few experiences in life are as stressful as the process of searching for a new job. From dealing with recruiters and online application systems, to preparing for interviews and negotiating salaries, the anxiety of the job hunt is universal. Once again, the main culprit is a feeling of powerlessness. Did they receive your resume? Who are you competing against? What if they don’t offer you the job? All these unanswered questions contribute to a sense that you’re not in control of your own future. Even if you currently have a job, the picture is no rosier. Workplace stress is pervasive—over 60 percent of Americans say they feel it three or more days per week on average—and is marked by a feeling that your time and your priorities are being dictated by others. Hospitality workers, journalists, and executives all complain of having too much responsibility and too little authority. The common theme is a sense that you have little or no control over your day-to-day activities. And when that happens, it doesn’t matter if you’re searching for a new job or unhappy in your current one, it can feel like you’re trapped. You can reclaim control by being proactive. Here are some things you can do today: Clip job hunting resources like LinkedIn postings, recruiter emails, and company culture pages, so everything you need is in one place. Practice answering interview questions in a note, and use it as a study guide before your big day. Prioritize your daily to-do list with the most important items at the top. Tackling these tasks early in the day creates a sense of accomplishment that makes the day feel progressively easier. Track your workplace successes so you can see your wins accumulate . Every time someone praises your work or you see concrete results, jot it down in a note. Pro tip: Your “wins” note doesn’t have to end when you leave a job. Keep adding to it year after year and look back with pride as your career grows over time. As you head into the new year, stop and take a moment to check in with yourself. While you may feel powerless right now, recognize that you have within you the ability to take control and reduce stress in your life. Small steps will add up to big wins, and you can use the momentum of those victories to make 2020 your best year ever.", "date": "2019-12-30,"},

Whether it’s organizing and accessing lecture notes, collaborating with a group on a class project, creating a book report, or even organizing after-school activities, Evernote is there to help you focus on what matters most, both inside and outside of the classroom. It’s simple to use and the organizational tools are flexible. Which means you can use Evernote the way you want to. The big picture is that you can put almost anything into Evernote. You can type in notes. Hand write notes. Capture audio recordings of classes and meetings. Take photos. You can even take a picture of any document or whiteboard, like assignments or class notes, and Evernote will store the text and make it searchable. Even handwritten text is searchable! In order to get a first-hand view of Evernote in the classroom, we decided to go straight to the source, and we didn’t have to go all that far. We sat down with one of our summer interns, Marcelo Coelho, to learn how Evernote helps him stay focused while pursuing his degree. Evernote: Where are you in school and what’s your after-graduation goal? Marcelo: I grew up in Brazil and I’m doing my Masters in UX Design at L’École de Design in Nantes, France. I’m planning on a career in tech after graduation. Evernote: How does Evernote help you stay focused with a heavy course load? Marcelo: So many ways. Actually, I used Evernote from the very beginning when I was just looking at different schools and trying to find the right Masters program. Then there was all the paperwork involved with getting a visa. I kept track of all the immigration bureaucracy and the application process in Evernote. So before I even got here, Evernote was an amazing help in making these big changes easier to handle. Evernote: Any specific features that helped you during the application process? Marcelo: Having everything in one place was great. Applications, letters, responses, program descriptions, letters of recommendation. It all went into Evernote. The other part is that all of that information was always with me. Laptop or phone. So when it was time to make an important decision like which country to move to, or which Masters program to choose, I had all the relevant info with me and well organized. I wasn’t wasting time at the last minute looking around my room for something important. It actually helped me make better decisions. It was amazing, after I got here and started work, I looked back at my notes and realized that I had gotten my Evernote design internship by using Evernote! Evernote: Do you prefer the desktop or the mobile version? Marcelo: Both, because the ability to access your notes everywhere is so important. But I mainly use the desktop version of Evernote, since it’s more comfortable for me to write there. The full-sized keyboard and big screen are a huge advantage for working on long docs. At the same time, the fact that I can always have my notes with me on mobile helps a lot when trying to remember essential things or documenting ideas that happen when I am away from the computer. Evernote: What advice would you give students thinking of adopting Evernote as part of their toolset for school? Marcelo: Set up Evernote on all your devices and start adding content, including pictures of your handwritten notes or paper documents from school. In the beginning, it may be hard to create the habit. But the fact that you can quickly search everything, wherever you are in the future, pays off! Here’s a close-up of some of the ways Evernote lightens the load for students: One class at a time Say goodbye to a notebook for every class, or one giant notebook with a bunch of tabs. You can set up a notebook in Evernote with a click. Give it a name, like biology or English, and everything having to do with that class goes in there. Student notes. Quiz schedules. Even papers you’ve written and other assignments. And if your school is on board, you can share these documents with teachers via email or a shareable link. With Evernote, the days of losing important class material are over. Imagine that. Less stress and chaos, no missed deadlines. You can’t forget anything With a busy schedule made even busier with endless distractions, it’s no wonder things slip through the cracks every once in a while. Or every other day. Evernote is there to help you remember. When you enter a note, you have the option of setting a reminder that sticks to that note and keeps you on schedule. From the pull-down menu in a note, you simply set the date and you’ll receive an in-app reminder as well as an email reminder. It’s like having a real live assistant. Everything everywhere If you’re going to a history class and decide you’ve got time for the chemistry lab right after, no problem. You have what you need. As long as you have your laptop or tablet, everything for every class is at your fingertips. And if you don’t have your device with you and there’s a computer available, you’re still good. Evernote is cloud based so all of your notes in your app are also available on a browser. Research made easy One of the most important features in Evernote is Web Clipper. In short, it lets you save anything you find on the web. You simply install the free browser extension and that’s it. To use it, look for the little Evernote elephant icon up in the address bar. When you land on a page you’d like to save, click the icon and save the whole page, part of the page, text only, or image only. However you’d like to reference that page in the future, Evernote Web Clipper makes that possible. Imagine you’ve been browsing for something for hours and you finally find it. You could bookmark it. But way better, save the contents into Evernote. You can store it where you can find it, and even if the live page changes or moves, what you have clipped will remain. Research heaven. What matters most Having a plan helps you set your priorities—you decide what needs to be done and by when. Some things are urgent, some can wait. Knowing which is which is half the battle. We like to think of it this way: Evernote helps you focus on what matters most, and one way to do that is with tags. For example, let’s say you have a math test on Thursday and you have a study guide for preparation. Enter the study guide into your math notebook and add the tag #tests to it. Then, when you need to find it again, simply search your tags for ‘#tests’ and it’ll pop right up. You can create tags for any keywords that make sense to you (such as the subject, course code, or day of the week). Then, when you make or review a note, simply add the appropriate tag to it. Evernote is any student’s best friend If you struggle with staying organized, or just want to get the most out of your day, it’s time to go back to school—with Evernote . It clears your mind of all the stuff you’re supposed to remember so you have time to learn.", "date": "2018-09-7,"},

However, it’s natural to get stuck staring at a blank screen sometimes, so we wanted to give you an easy way to get started. That’s why we created templates. Your ideas, plans, or processes can benefit from being structured in a certain way, but creating that structure can be frustrating.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Looking Ahead: Evernote’s Priorities for 2019", "author": ["Ian Small"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/looking-ahead-evernotes-priorities-2019/", "abstract": "On my first day as CEO of Evernote, I blogged about how excited I was to join the company and how much I was looking forward to inventing the future with you. I have spent the last two months learning about Evernote, both from the inside out and from the outside in. From the inside out, I’ve been meeting and talking with legions of hard-working team members dedicated to improving the Evernote experience for every one of you. I’ve been spending time with the management team, and with Evernote’s board, assessing where the company stands, and becoming really clear on Evernote’s strengths and weaknesses. I’ve also been reviewing the company’s financial health—which I’m pleased to report is extremely sound. From the outside in, I’ve been spending time listening to you: our customers, partners, and community—the people who know Evernote best. I’ve talked directly with a number of community members, and I’ve traveled twice to our site in Austin, which is the hub for our Customer Service and Customer Success organizations—the Evernote team members who are closest to you, and who most reliably represent your voice inside the company. And I’ve spent time looking at the overall competitive landscape, understanding how the category that Evernote created has continued to grow, and is now shaped by many companies. I continue to be passionate about inventing the future. Sixty days in, working with an incredibly talented team, we are starting to surface some ideas of what that future might look like, and in particular, we are starting to understand how each of you could come to experience a better and more powerful Evernote than you do today. But inventing the future requires being able to stand on a solid foundation. And whether I look at Evernote from the inside out, or listen to many of you from the outside in, it is clear that we have some work to do on those foundations. The loyalty that you continue to show Evernote demands that we be honest in return. And honesty requires us to state—straight out—that we can do better with the product you have today than we are currently doing. In fact, we can do better than we have been doing for some years. Frankly, it’s a bit disingenuous for me to try to get our most dedicated users all fired up about inventing the future of Evernote when exactly those same people are the ones who know best that sync doesn’t always work right. Or that Evernote on Windows is a bit tired, and is missing features that are found on the Mac version. Or that each version of Evernote seems to work slightly differently, and exhibits its own unique collection of bugs and undesirable behaviors. Or that Evernote on mobile devices sometimes feels like a pared-down version of a powerful desktop app, instead of a mobile-first view into a powerful cloud-enabled productivity environment. None of this is a surprise to the team that works here, or to Evernote’s board. There are reasons each of these problems exists, and for the hundred other things that we all wish were better than they are. But I’m not going to bore you with explanations, because even if I thought you would read a blog post that long, the explanations simply are not relevant. Because ultimately, by choosing to use Evernote, each of you gives us the privilege of serving you. Of trying to make your life more focused, more organized, and more productive. In return, it’s our responsibility and our duty to serve you well. So while I’m still excited about inventing the future, what I’m here to tell you today is that in order to invent the future of Evernote, we first need to improve Evernote’s foundations. And as we look forward into 2019, that’s going to be our focus not just as we start the year, but for a good portion of it. Our goals are simple but meaningful: We’re going to create a more coherent, more consistent Evernote experience for every version of the product we ship, starting from Evernote Basic on up—an experience that fixes the essential features on which all of us depend. We’re going to make fundamental changes to how we develop and deliver software—so that we can start to ship faster across all the devices we support, and so that all of us can experience the same Evernote, regardless of which device we use to experience it. And we’re going to make improvements to the core infrastructure that sits behind the applications you experience so that we can deliver an Evernote with the speed, reliability, and scalability that all of us expect. This is not an easy task. It’s one which the company has, for some number of years, not been ready to undertake. And even as we focus the vast majority of our development energy on these goals, undoubtedly we will still disappoint some of you—whether it’s because you don’t like the way we choose to fix something, or we don’t prioritize a particular bug that drives you around the bend, or because with an eye to coherence and consistency we redesign and streamline a particular feature upon which your workflow is built. Despite those risks, I am convinced that focusing on the basics is what we need to do first in order to best serve you not just now, but years into the future. With the board supporting this effort, I can also report that the team’s reaction to this plan has been nothing less than excitement at the prospect of building a new generation of Evernote that we can all believe in. As we enter 2019, we revisit that part of the year in which it’s traditional to focus on ways we can improve our lives. In the last few days, we’ve launched the Ever Better Challenge , a free 30-day plan for using Evernote to help maintain your focus on the things you want to change in your life. As we encourage each of you to become Ever Better, it’s important to let you know that we’re holding ourselves to that challenge as well. So here’s to 2019, a year in which all of us here at Evernote will work towards creating an Ever Better Evernote, starting first by focusing on the basics. —Ian", "date": "2019-01-3,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Making the Most of Working from Home", "author": ["Barbara Atkinson"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/making-the-most-of-working-from-home/", "abstract": "It wasn’t that long ago that telecommuting was considered a rare setup for an employee or contractor. That’s no longer the case. A significant number of US workers ( 37 percent, by some estimates ) fulfill their job duties from somewhere other than an office. But how is it possible to work from home and be productive with so many distractions and temptations? Your mindset and environment are just as important as good old-fashioned self-discipline as a recipe for remote work success. Research shows that productivity is generally not an issue for most off-site workers. A U.S. News & World Report found that offsite workers tend to be productive even when they’re sick, and typically work five to seven more hours per week than their on-site counterparts. Still, there are times when even the most well-meaning among us might accidentally ignore our co-workers or forget for an afternoon that “off-site” doesn’t mean “off the clock.” Here‘s how some successful telecommuters live the dream. “Go” to work: symbolically, it’s effective One of the biggest perks of working alone in your home is boundary blurring. Wearing your jammies all day, keeping the television on for company, hosting breakfast meetings for you and your cat—you get all that and more. Starting your work day should mean more than nudging aside the cereal bowl. Your mentality may be affecting your job performance, and ultimately, how you feel about your role. Though many of us don’t have an extra room in our homes to use an office, a dedicated workspace helps keep you focused. Working in a chaotic house full of teens or kids, or just an elbow’s length away from a sink full of dirty dishes are both distractions you don’t need. Some telecommuters shower and get dressed as if they’re heading into an office and then march into their office or guest bedroom. Others park themselves at the end of the dining room table they only use during work hours. “I’m a very big believer in having an office that is separate from your living space, although not everyone can do that,” says Julie Francis , BellaVia Research UX research and strategy founder . Francis has maintained a home office for more than a decade. ”For me, the second I walk in my office, I’m in work mode. There’s no transition.” If you can’t carve out a physical space just for you and your laptop, you can at least do so mentally. Invest in good noise-cancelling headphones, if that helps you shut out the outside world. Ignore the dishes until you’ve hit a project goal. Tell your kids to knock on your door at their peril. Your personal “do not disturb” policy may be your only way of treating your home office as a “real” office. If getting ready for each day is nothing more than showering and pulling on your “day jammies,” that’s up to you. Set your pace: sprint or marathon What keeps your engine running? To be successful, you need to be honest about what keeps you productive and work with, not against, your style. Are you a sprinter, or a marathoner? Sprinters: Work in small, intense periods of time, and can get work done in significant chunks. Need little breaks now and then in order to catch their breath. Might need five-minute mini-breaks every hour? Marathoners: Like to stay focused for longer stretches before coming up for air. Work best with long, uninterrupted blocks of time to get into the zone Some people are a mix of the two: long blocks of time in the morning, with short bursts throughout the afternoon. There’s no wrong approach, so work with your natural rhythm. If you’re a sprinter, breaking up your larger projects into discrete segments is going to make your day a lot more pleasant and keep you more effective. Bend with it: Being flexible is how you don’t break Flex time is how many high-intensity employees are able to meet all of the demands on their time. “I work from home three days a week and am able to keep work and home separate simply because I have a six-year-old that demands my attention once she gets home from school,” says Beth Faris , Senior Marketing Manager at O’Reilly Media . “However, I may work some more after she goes to bed in the evening.” Keeping flexible hours even part-time can be a way to maintain some semblance of work/life balance. Many off-site workers stay glued to their work space all day, even when they can take breaks. If you’re telecommuting and can take care of your other pursuits around that scheduling flexibility, all the better. Block out your lunch breaks to hit the gym or work on your Great American Novel. Can you call into non-essential meetings while walking the dog (with your phone on mute, of course), or getting your steps in on the treadmill? What can you do to make the job flexibility work for you? Mission Possible: Stay focused even away from your desk Whether you step away from work during the day, or power through your hours, you need to find some way to maintain your focus. “You do need to get out of the house,” says writer and editor Sandra Miller . “You need to mix it up a little bit to avoid cabin fever. Run out to the local deli to grab lunch, but don’t also wander into the bookstore down the street. Grab coffee with a friend, but keep an eye on the clock. If it’s still your work day, outings should have some sort of goal, and your goals should have time limits.” Breaking up the day doesn’t work for everyone, however. “I do not run errands during work hours,” says sales coordinator Lauri Lerner . “I don’t want my work day spread out over 12-14 hours. I focus on work during my eight, nine, or 10 hours, and only after that will I go out and do errands.” Ditch multitasking: Don’t do more just for the sake of more “Multitasking” has long been a corporate buzzword, as if it’s the desired state for ultimate productivity. But according to the American Psychological Association , doing more than one task at a time takes a toll on productivity. Not all of us are designed to be natural multitaskers. Some telecommuters prefer to limit how often they check their incoming emails to once an hour, rather than looking at each message as it arrives. Communication is key: Touch base early and often Though it can be frustrating to admit, if you’re not physically visible, you run the risk of being perceived as unavailable. It’s up to you to show ‘em you’re on top of tasks and dedicated to those deliverables. “Communication is key for me,” says periodic telecommuter Martha Garcia , an executive assistant at Logitech . “When I’m offsite, I’m still visible and reachable at all times. I make sure I remain in a position to reply immediately when someone needs me, even if I’m not actually sitting in my home office.” “Schedule video meetings instead of phone meetings as often as you can,” suggests Francis. “As much as we all hate to be on a webcam, it really does make meetings more efficient.”  If you use Slack, Google Hangouts, or any other type of chat tool, make sure your status is updated to indicate your availability. If you do go offline, leave a status indicating when you’ll be back. If you just need focusing time, put that into your message, don’t just say you’re away, or it will send the wrong message. Goals and deliverables: Be the boss of you Ultimately, working off-site is best if you’re disciplined. Francis firmly believes in what she calls “the golden rule of procrastination.” “Always do the thing on your to-do list that you least want to do. It’s often the hardest thing, and once it’s done, it’s a huge relief.” Always do the thing on your to-do list that you least want to do.  –Julie Francis How successful you are will always depend on how well you and your company manage your physical absence. “I work at a very flexible company that favors telecommuters,” says Garcia. “We use phone, email, text, and Google Hangouts —so you can literally work from anywhere as long as you have access to the internet and a phone. Not every company is like this, so I think it is much easier to be an effective telecommuter if your company gives their employees the flexibility and the tools to be one.” This article was originally published on the Evernote Blog on July 7, 2017.", "date": "2020-03-10,"},

This was not an easy decision. While you, our most dedicated customers, are all too familiar with some of Evernote’s shortcomings over the years, our decision to focus 2019 on foundational work meant spending months “running silent,” without releasing new features or even minor improvements. It’s been eight months since I wrote that blog post, and it’s time for me to follow up. When we embarked on this path, we set out three goals with far-reaching impact: We wanted to create a more coherent, more consistent Evernote experience; an experience that fixes the essential features on which all of us depend. We decided to change the way we develop and deliver software, so we can ship improvements and new features faster and with better quality. We committed to improving the core infrastructure that powers Evernote, so we can deliver a service with the speed, reliability, and scalability that all of us expect. We are making progress against all of these goals. As you’ve seen in our Behind the Scenes video series, we’ve been working to improve all levels of Evernote, from client to cloud: We’ve completely rebuilt and redesigned the note editor . We’ve created a new search interface on top of new high-performance search algorithms. We’ve created a new, converged design for our mobile apps. We’ve made tagging consistent across all our platforms . We’ve implemented new scalable storage architectures in the cloud. We’ve unified our sync algorithms across all your devices (oops, no video for that one yet!). And even all that is just scratching the surface. Frankly, there are not a lot of stones being left unturned in our quest to build a more consistent and coherent experience, a more scalable and reliable service, and a new foundation that we can use to innovate faster and with more quality at Evernote than we’ve demonstrated before. This has only been possible with your ongoing support and participation in the process. We’ve seen that support and participation in the feedback you’ve given to our Behind the Scenes videos. We’ve seen it in confidential previews—thousands of you giving us early feedback on rough prototypes. We’ve seen it in betas at both small and large scale—more than 200,000 of you are beta-ing our new note editor for everyday use in our modern web experience, giving us valuable feedback and helping us fine-tune its performance. And we’ve seen your support in how you’ve continued to stick with us through this journey. Thank you. I am humbled—our entire team is humbled—by your dedication and commitment to our product. In return for your support, you need to know that we’ll be here for you as long as you need us. Being financially independent and self-sustaining ensures that’s the case. Thanks to you, I can report that even as we work through this difficult year of “running silent,” you have supported us with record revenues. I’m also pleased to report that we are cash flow positive for the year-to-date and fully expect to keep improving on that position through the end of the year. We are building a stronger, more stable Evernote. An Evernote that is here—for you!—for the long term. We have been making real progress against the promises we made in January. We’ll soon be ready to take a number of our larger efforts out for a test drive, including new mobile, desktop, and web versions that all work the same way, look and feel the same, and let you move easily from device to device in your Evernote world. In just a few weeks, everyone will have access to a public beta version of our new editor for Evernote Web, after which we’ll have folks trying out our new interactive search capabilities, closing the loop on some early design work we showed you back in May. To really get these test drives going, we still need your help. Our latest Behind the Scenes video introduced our beta program and how your participation shapes the future of Evernote. Every one of you who joins our beta program gets us closer to releasing new clients. Every one of you who joins accelerates our path to innovating again. Every one of you has a voice that is heard, as together we build the great movement that is Evernote. To be a part of that movement, please watch the video and sign up here . The goal we set for this year was to create a foundation for building an ever better Evernote. We’re making good progress. And really, we’re just getting started. Let’s build an ever better Evernote. Let’s build it together.", "date": "2019-09-12,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "2020 Update: Our Progress and the Road Ahead", "author": ["Ian Small"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/2020-update-progress-road-ahead/", "abstract": "It’s January, a new year has begun, so it’s an appropriate time for an update on where we stand in our efforts to bring you a better Evernote. One year ago, in my early days as Evernote’s CEO, I said that to move Evernote forward we had to start by improving its foundations. I set three goals as our priorities for 2019: We wanted to create a more coherent, more consistent Evernote experience; an experience that fixes the essential features on which all of us depend. We decided to change the way we develop and deliver software, so we can ship improvements and new features faster and with better quality. We committed to improving the core infrastructure that powers Evernote, so we can deliver a service with the speed, reliability, and scalability that all of us expect. I’m pleased to say that we’ve made substantial progress against all of these goals, even beyond the progress we’ve regularly shared over the course of last year. I’ll get to that in a minute. But first, it’s important to be bluntly honest about where we stand. As we enter 2020, we’ve not yet achieved everything we set out to accomplish a year ago. We have yet to reach some major milestones in delivering against the three goals above. We’re not where any of us—the Evernote team, our customers, our community, or our partners—wanted Evernote to be at this point. The most visible hole in our delivery plan is our failure to ship new mobile and desktop apps in general release. My best estimate is that we’re running 3–4 months behind our plans. It’s certainly not for any lack of trying or a lack of focus. But some hills turn out to be harder to climb than you think when you set off on a trek, and we’ve had to do a lot of climbing so far in our journey. The result is that many of the improvements we’ve demonstrated in our Behind the Scenes videos are not yet available for you to enjoy. That’s disappointing for you, and it’s disappointing for us. We will continue to work hard to bring those improvements to market so we can all enjoy a better Evernote, and start to innovate quickly upon that improved foundation. But the past year has not been without significant accomplishments. Let me recap for a moment some of the highlights we experienced together in 2019: Your collective reaction to the new note editor , made available through our modern web experience, has been very positive. The methodical process we followed to beta test, gather feedback, make improvements, and incrementally release the new note editor was very effective. And this first release of the new note editor is just the start; we plan to continue improving it in the months ahead. Our new search experience , also made available through the web app, has had an extremely positive response as well. We modeled that release process on what we learned from the editor. During the search beta, we made changes to functionality and improvements to relevancy algorithms as well as finding and fixing bugs. We continue to get feedback from customers about how they imagine this search interface playing into their desktop experience; we will keep investing in search in the months to come. We created a new communications channel using our Behind the Scenes videos , balancing transparency about what we were working on with the pragmatic reality of where we were in the process. The entire company was inspired by the constructive way in which you received, reacted to, and engaged with these videos—in many cases providing feedback that refined the trajectory of the work even before our initial releases in market. And from a business standpoint, Evernote continued to grow. We ended 2019 with more subscribers than when we entered it, generating positive cash flow for the year. A healthy balance sheet may not at first sound like a highlight, but a financially sound Evernote is a company you can depend on to serve you for a long time. If you’ve been following along all year, nothing I’ve said above is news. So let me turn to some recent accomplishments we haven’t talked about much yet: a re-engineered modern web experience, the first preview release of our rebuilt mobile clients, and a successful data migration in the cloud. In December, we released a completely re-engineered version of our modern web experience to a small group of customers. And, as planned, they didn’t notice. On the outside, this version is almost indistinguishable from what many of us already use on a day-to-day basis. But on the inside, its codebase has been substantially renovated on top of a new code library that governs communication between client and cloud (more on this later). This is a major deliverable against the second goal I set for Evernote at the beginning of 2019. Our objective with this initiative was to swap out some old, rusty underpinnings for a gleaming new undercarriage, without anyone noticing. And so far, so good. We’ll continue to release in the coming months until 100 percent of web customers are on the new-and-improved client infrastructure. Again in December, we released the first version of our completely rebuilt iOS and Android apps to a small pool of beta testers. These apps (shown in a December Behind the Scenes video ) demonstrate how we’re trying to deliver on our first two goals, with mobile design and functionality consistent with the innovations we’ve made on the web client. This includes adapting the new note editor and new search for the small screen, consistent navigational cues, and improvements made on one platform applied to both mobile apps (for instance, tags are now first-class citizens on both iOS and Android). None of the above would have been possible without our Beta Program testers. Your feedback is critical to helping us build apps that meet your needs, so please keep it coming. We still have work to do on both functionality and performance, but we will keep ramping releases of the new mobile apps through the coming months. As I indicated above, both the new re-engineered web release and the rebuilt mobile clients share the same code library governing communication between app and cloud . While this might not seem relevant to you as a user, aligning our code bases and internal architecture across all Evernote apps is a huge step toward a better Evernote experience for everyone. It results in service behavior that is predictable and consistent across platforms (for example, sync should work the same way on different devices). It also minimizes bugs by reducing the volume of code we need to test and simplifies and speeds our ability to find and stamp out bugs when they do occur. And finally, what no one has noticed—and again, this is a good thing!—is that since late November, 100% of your note content is now synced and served from a completely new storage system in our cloud . This is a remarkable step toward our third goal. Moving more than 9 billion notes on a running service from one storage architecture to another, without anyone noticing and without any downtime, is like changing the wheels on a moving bus. It required a tricky migration from the (warning: geek speak ahead) legacy sharded architecture, which had for years formed the basis for Evernote’s server architecture, into a scalable, horizontal “cloud” implementation. There is yet more work to do on this front (next up: sharing permissions), but when we are done with this process, we will have eliminated one of the larger roadblocks to our ability to innovate—a constraint that has been hindering Evernote for years. These more recent accomplishments are foundational building blocks for delivering on the three goals we set out for Evernote at the beginning of 2019. At that time, I asked you to be patient with us, and as I stated above, we’re running late. None of us are happy to enter 2020 still asking you to be patient. But the good news is that we’ve now got ourselves (and you!) onto the launching pad. The re-engineered web client (in limited release), the new mobile clients (in first preview), and the (as yet unreleased) new clients for Windows, Mac, and (yes!) Linux, along with the ongoing re-architecture and data migration we’ve been doing in the cloud, will set up Evernote to be able to innovate and ship with quality at a pace we haven’t seen in a long time. And what’s most exciting to me—and, I hope, to all of you—is that the “finish” line to fixing the basics isn’t really a finish line at all. It’s the starting line of a new race : the race toward a whole new generation of innovation and improvement in the Evernote experience. In some quiet corners of Evernote, we’ve already started running that race, and I’m looking forward to sharing that work with you when the time is right. Thank you for your enduring patience and support. We are continuing to work hard to make you proud, to live up to and keep earning the trust you place in us, and to deliver an Evernote all of us can fall in love with all over again. Together, we will make Evernote #everbetter.", "date": "2020-01-14,"},

For more productivity advice, visit her website, ciaraconlon.com . In Evernote’s recent blog post “ 4 Simple Ways to Break a Bad Habit ,” you learned about the Habit Loop and the role it plays in your life. Understanding the Cue, Craving, Response and Reward of the Habit Loop can help you identify patterns of negative behavior that have become automated in your life, often without your conscious awareness. Once a habit is automated, though, it is difficult to break, because it occurs in the most primitive part of the brain: the basal ganglia . In reality, the most successful way to break a bad habit forever is to replace it with a positive one. So let’s delve a little deeper into the creation of habits and how you can change your behavior to make positive habits, such as planning your week, clearing your inbox, or even becoming a ‘morning person,’ easier and more consistent with each day. 21 days: myth or truth? You may have heard it takes 21 days to form a habit; it turns out this may not be entirely true. The idea was first suggested by a plastic surgeon who observed that it took his patients an average of 21 days to get used to their new faces. But more recent research on the subject, by Phillippa Lally et al. in the University of London , found it took people an average of 66 days to create a new habit, with results ranging from 15 to 254 days. One thing, however, remains true: The more we repeat a habit under the same circumstances, the easier it gets. While mastering the Habit Loop will help you build better habits in the short term, it doesn’t account for all the elements you need to consider before attempting to make life-long change—elements which, if absent, can actually sabotage your success. Here then are my 4 Ds of Habit Creation, otherwise known as The Habit Method : Desire, Decision, Design , and Discipline . Is the Desire there? Desire is the first, and possibly most important, component of habit creation. You must have a burning desire for the new habit, and understand why you want it. What is the goal you long to reach? Why is it so important in your life? Without true desire your resolve will be weak when the going gets tough. Your desire is what will fuel the fire when the light is burning low. Often our thoughts work against us, damaging our attempts before we have even begun. But when you focus on desire and are clear about what you want and why, your thoughts and beliefs will be in alignment, supporting you in moving in the direction of your goals. Try keeping a journal to capture your daily thoughts in relation to your new habit, to make sure they’re encouraging your efforts. Your positive thoughts will be the support system for your desire, propelling you toward your new habit. Has the Decision been made? Making the decision to move forward will carry your desire from thought to action. When you decide you’re going to do something, you must make a commitment. Move away from half-hearted decisions and promise yourself you’ll do what it takes to reach the goals you’ve set. Deciding what you want and making sure it’s your top priority are vital for success. But often we get confused about which direction to take and what to do next. The Eisenhower Matrix can help you identify your priorities and ensure the direction you choose is the right one for your life right now. Once you make the decision, this clarity will help you move forward fearlessly. Take time to Design your habit Now you know what you want, and have committed to getting it, you need to make a plan. How are you going to achieve this goal? What do you need to get going? Who will support you? Spending time to get clear on these now will leave less chance for opting out later. Thinking through your plan in advance and having tools and techniques will help you move into action. The Habi t Canvas is a resource that can help you plan out your new habit, paying attention to the 4 Ds and increasing your chances of success. Do you have the Discipline ? Willpower and discipline alone aren’t enough to form new habits, but the latter plays an important role in the process. Until your habit becomes second nature, you will need to rely on discipline to help you establish the new routines. Using Evernote’s Habit Tracker template will keep you motivated while you’re working toward automating your habit. For discipline to work, it also requires a strong command of your thoughts. Meditation can help you rein in the ‘ monkey mind ’ and better manage your unhelpful negative thoughts. Insight Timer is a great tool for both beginner and experienced meditators and claims to have the largest free library of guided meditations on earth. BONUS: Is your Environment right? It’s an element that is often overlooked, but your environment has a big influence on your state of mind and state of being. Even Charles Darwin admitted he hadn’t put enough emphasis on environment in his theory of natural selection ! When your environment is designed optimally, it will be easier for you to take the regular action needed to create your new habits. A challenging environment is not an excuse to opt out or give up, though. It may require more planning and adaptation, and a little more creative design and discipline, but if you have the 4 Ds in place, your actions will still lead you to success. No matter what, take daily action to ensure your environment is supporting you and not sabotaging you. A few positive habits to get started If you’re looking for inspiration, here are a few powerful habits that can transform your productivity and positively impact other areas of your life. Start a weekly review Use Evernote’s Weekly Review template to help you stay in control of your workload and your life. Create a recurring appointment in your calendar on a Friday afternoon to review the week and plan for the upcoming week. You can find David Allen’s weekly review checklist here. Plan your life Build the habit of planning with Evernote’s daily , weekly , monthly and yearly planning templates, to keep your work in order and bring focus to your goals. Taking the time to plan will reduce the chaos in your life and make it easier for you to reach your goals. Achieve Inbox Zero Stop using your inbox as your to-do list, and store your tasks and goals in Evernote instead. Integrations for Gmail and Outlook let you forward emails from your inbox directly to Evernote, giving you a place to store all your stuff, and stay more organized and in control. Merlin Mann, the guy who made us all believe Inbox Zero was a possibility, has lots of tips on his website to help you to reach this previously elusive state. Creating positive habits is about more than grit and determination; there is a proven method you can follow to greatly increase your chances of success. With some reflection and a little bit of planning you’ll be well on your way to creating the positive habits you’ve always craved.", "date": "2020-03-3,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Make a Plan and Get What You Want in Life", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-to-make-a-plan/", "abstract": "Imagine you woke up one day and decided to build yourself a house. How would you begin? Grab a hammer and some nails and just go for it? Or draw up blueprints, clear the ground, and prepare a solid foundation first? If the thought of starting without a plan sounds ridiculous, you’re right. It’s a recipe for disaster—or at least a very unstable structure. But it’s exactly what you’re doing if you’re not creating an action plan for your life. To be clear, having a plan is different than having a goal . Many people have goals, such as finding a new job, making more money, or losing weight. But without a plan for achieving those goals, research says 92 percent of them will ultimately fail. What do the eight percent who succeed understand that the rest of us (apparently) don’t? They’ve learned that “A goal without a plan is just a wish.” The benefits of planning Creating a plan may seem like an inconvenience when you want your journey to a better life to begin now. But traversing new territory is easier when you have a map—whether that’s taking a vacation, earning a promotion, or starting a new business. Here are four specific benefits of planning: Improved productivity. When you know how to get from one place to another, you’re less likely to suffer from “paralysis by analysis.” Planning prevents you from wasting your energy on unnecessary tasks and, as author Brian Tracy says , “every minute spent in planning saves as many as ten minutes in execution.” Increased focus. Planning helps you focus on the task at hand—you know what you need to do today, and why. This helps you feel more in control, by showing you what you can change and what is outside your control. Greater self-confidence. If your goals have always been just beyond your grasp, it may be because you’ve never created an effective plan for reaching them. Once you have a plan in place, you’ll be surprised by how much you’re able to accomplish. Greater self-awareness. To create a plan is to begin to understand yourself . It helps uncover your passions and priorities, and whether they reflect your true values. You come to learn about your personal tendencies, inclinations, and aversions—and how to overcome them! When you make a plan, you’re creating the blueprint to get from where you are now to where you want to be in the future. It takes your goal out of the world of fantasy, and into reality. How to build a plan that works Now that the importance of having a plan is clear, here are four steps you can take to create your own foundation for action. Write down your goal Once you’ve decided on your goal, write it down . Dr. Gail Matthews of Dominican University of California found that simply writing down a goal increases your likelihood of achieving it by 42 percent. Begin by picturing your goal. See it in your mind… feel it, taste it. Now capture it in as much detail as you possibly can, using the S.M.A.R.T. formula: Specific . This is the “who, what, when, where, and why” of your goal. Describe exactly how you define success, and the actions you’re willing to take to achieve it. Measurable . How will you measure your progress? For example, if your goal is to save money, by how much would you need to cut your spending? As writer Paulo Coelho says , “No one can hit their target with their eyes closed.” Achievable . Do you have the skills you need to reach your goal? If not, can you acquire them? This is not meant to discourage you; rather, it should motivate you to set realistic goals, and seek out help if needed. Relevant . Is this goal really what you want? Does it fit with your broader ambitions? Creating a ‘life map’ using the Swiss PDP Approach can help you recognize what truly matters to you. Time-bound . When will you complete your goal? Without a deadline, there’ll always be more time, so there’s no sense of urgency. Setting a time limit motivates you to act now , before it’s too late. Pro tips: Once you’ve decided on a goal, capture it with Evernote’s Yearly Goals template. Or if you’ve written it down on paper, scan it into Evernote so you can refer back to it at any time. Use Web Clipper to save any content you find online that motivates you and helps you get closer to your goal. Create a plan by dividing your goal into chunks Identifying your goal is a crucial first step. But big goals can be overwhelming, and it may seem like you just don’t know how to get there. Sadly, this is where many people give up. Instead, now that you know where you want to finish, break it down into chunks. If your goal is to have a successful business in two years, where do you need to be in one year? Six months? Next week? Create a plan that divides your goal into small, incremental steps. Write down each step and set a deadline for its completion. That way, you’re not overwhelmed by the mountain you’re climbing, you’re just putting one foot in front of the other. Each morning when you get up, you know what you need to do that day and why. Pro tip: Use Evernote’s Daily Planner and Weekly Planner templates to break down your goal into manageable chunks. Create an entry for each step you need to take—and don’t forget to reward yourself for the progress you make along the way! Review your plan daily A blueprint is no good if you never look at it. To stay on track, be sure to review it regularly—daily if possible. Read your goal aloud every day, preferably as soon as you get up in the morning. It’s a great way to set your intention for the day and keep your focus where it belongs: on the plan you’ve developed, and the specific actions that will move you closer to your goal. Pro tips : Set a reminder on your goal for the same time each day. When you get the reminder, take a moment to review your note and ask yourself what can do that day to make progress on your plan. Add your plan to your shortcuts in Evernote. That way, it’ll always be visible near the top of the list on the left side of your screen. Stay on target If your goal is big enough, you’ll need to stay focused to reach it—after all, we’re talking about a plan for life . As you complete each ‘chunk’ of your plan, take a moment to recognize the milestone. It’s an opportunity to celebrate your progress and reevaluate your plan: Is it still practical? Are there any adjustments you need to make? Refocusing on your goal will remind you of why you started in the first place, and give you a much-needed boost of energy. Pro tips : Share your plan with a friend. Having someone to hold you accountable can help you stay motivated when it might be tempting to give up, and gives you someone to support you through the tough times. Along with your goal, review your daily and weekly planners every day to ensure you’re making the most of your valuable time. A lifetime of accomplishment doesn’t happen by accident; it’s the result of careful planning and a determination to succeed. Once you create a solid plan for reaching your goals, you’ll be surprised at how your motivation increases. Accomplishment, then, is only a matter of time. Author’s note: Although I haven’t quoted it in this article, I’m indebted to Napoleon Hill’s classic book, “ Think and Grow Rich ” for inspiration. Despite being written in 1937, many of the principles he identified as being essential for accomplishment remain valid today. The language may be anachronistic by modern standards, but viewed through the lens of its time it’s still a great guide on how to plan your life for success.", "date": "2020-02-25,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Work More Effectively and Productively with the Eisenhower Matrix", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/work-effectively-with-the-eisenhower-matrix/", "abstract": "Dwight D. Eisenhower, the five-star general and the 34th President of the United States was heralded for his ability to lead and make decisions in times of conflict and duress. He prioritized people and resources above everything else. Even in the darkest hours and most pivotal moments of World War II, Eisenhower was intensely ambitious and steadfastly positive. And like many of our noteworthy luminaries, there remains a certain, almost apocryphal mystique behind how the legendary leader earned his own power-packed productivity tool. According to legend , the matrix below was attributed to Eisenhower who said, “What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.” Despite its questionable veracity, there’s not much difficulty in debating Eisenhower’s effectiveness in time management. It’s why the Eisenhower Matrix system exists today. His ability to manage his time and tasks was essentially a decision matrix—a framework for deciding what was important and what wasn’t. Most recently, the system has been popularized by Stephen Covey , author of The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Source: Stephen Covey, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People Time management solutions are a helpful antidote to days filled with increasingly blurred deadlines, incessant noise, and excessive disruptions. Today, one of the biggest business challenges (and personal challenges, too), is how we can decide what is urgent and what’s not. Once we clear that hurdle, procrastination melts away, and things start getting done. The Matrix Think of a task you need to do today. How do you decide when you’ll get it done, given all the competition from other items on your to-do list? Use the Eisenhower Matrix to help you figure it out Where you decide your task falls within a specific quadrant dictates where, when, and how long you should take to do that task. Take a look: Quadrant 1 – “Do it immediately” Type: Urgent and important These are the tasks and to-dos that need immediate attention. They are very important deadlines with the highest level of urgency. Quadrant 2 – “Decide when you’ll do it” Type: Important, but not urgent This is considered a strategic section of the matrix, perfect for long-term development. Items that belong here are important, but they do not require your immediate attention. Quadrant 3 – “Delegate to somebody else” Type: Urgent, but not important Phone calls, emails, and last-minute meeting requests belong in this quadrant. These types of tasks usually don’t warrant your attention because they don’t produce measurable output. The goal with these tasks is to make an attempt at eliminating and reducing the things that don’t help you do work. For some, delegation can be an attractive option by offloading work to others so that the calls, emails, and requests can still be handled, freeing you to focus on things that matter in other quadrants. Quadrant 4 – “Do it later” Type: Not important, not urgent Activities that belong in this quadrant are the time-sucking things that don’t contribute any value whatsoever. Simply put, this is the stuff of procrastination—the time-wasters that prevent us from accomplishing the more urgent and important tasks in the first two quadrants. It’s best for you to see them in this quadrant so you can work hard at completely eliminating them from your work day. Choose your own color To add a new dimension to your matrix, assign each of the sections in your system a color. The perfect color codes to implement can be modeled after those of firefighters . Assign each color priority level. For example: Red = urgent: Do this task immediately Yellow = important, but it’s not super urgent: Decide when you need to do it. Green = urgent, not important: Delegate this task! Grey = not urgent, not important: Dump this task! If you’re tackling the matrix for your professional goals, you may start to see that many of your to-dos are in quadrants one and three. The biggest payoff comes from actions in the second quadrant.These are the goal-setting and evaluation of business objectives that impact the long-term success of a business, yet, they are rarely classified as urgent. Be a steward of your most precious resource: time. Make a list of the things you need to do. Label each of the things with a number, one through four (matching the matrix). Now that you have written your list, you have an accurate representation of the things you need to work on, and what is most pressing. Urgent vs. important? It’s a huge challenge to understand the things that take you off your projected course compared to the things that will move the needle. But if we don’t get a handle on this fundamental time management issue, it could leave a lot of us wishing we could get things done instead of actually getting them done. Instead of focusing on solely the ‘urgent and important’ quadrant of the Eisenhower Matrix, ask yourself these questions to help set the future for your long-term decision-making strategies. When will you deal with the tasks that are important, but not urgent? When will you take the time to deal with the important tasks before they suddenly become urgent? If an emergency comes up, your priorities will change. For example, if you own a small business, and a customer calls and asks to speak to a manager about missed expectations, that suddenly takes precedence over other action items in your matrix. Things to be done President Eisenhower was able to delegate tasks to his staff. If you don’t have a staff, 25 percent of this matrix is useless. To solve the problem of being a staff of one, implement a to-do list. Assign a number on each task from the list to the quadrant to which it belongs in the matrix. If you need another way to think about what needs to be done and when, look no further than multi-billionaire, Warren Buffett. He suggests making a list of all the things you have to get done each day. Start with the very top of your list and scratch it off when you have completed it. To do more – design your time Here are a few more tips on using the matrix to your advantage so you can accomplish more. To-do lists help ease your mind. How you employ a list is up to you, but make sure you question (much like Mr. Buffett), what you need to accomplish first. Priority is key. The point of each quadrant is to add many actions and tasks, but it will get over-complicated if you have more than seven or eight action items. The goal is accomplishment. Try creating a separate list and matrix for your professional and personal life. Only you get to define the priority level of the action items on your list. Hit the to-do list every morning, and you’ll start to experience how it feels to accomplish your tasks at the end of the day or week. Use the Eisenhower Matrix in Evernote. Grab this template and save it to your Evernote account. Tip: If you’ll be using it frequently, make it a shortcut!", "date": "2017-05-2,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Case for Digital Notes", "author": ["Tiago Forte"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/the-case-for-digital-notes/", "abstract": "About the author Tiago Forte is the founder of Forte Labs and editor of the Praxis online publication. In his course Building a Second Brain , Tiago teaches people how to capture, organize, and share their most valuable ideas and knowledge to support creative work. He calls this collection of ideas and knowledge a “second brain,” putting everything you learn right at your fingertips so you can find it when it matters most. In previous articles on the Evernote blog, Evernote and the Brain: Designing Creativity Workflows and Bending the Curves of Productivity, I argued that each person possesses a unique stream of information from numerous sources, and that professional success increasingly depends on curating, tweaking, redirecting, and capturing value from this stream to use in your work. I call this process Personal Knowledge Management, or PKM for short. But why are digital notes apps in particular the best choice for personal knowledge management? The truth is, there are many kinds of software you could use to save your personal knowledge. Each category is best suited for something different. Word-processing apps like Microsoft Word are designed for special formatting options and for printing, but they aren’t very convenient for jotting down a quick thought. Social media networks like Facebook and Twitter are great for sharing, but make it hard to save things for the long term. Cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Docs work well for collaboration, but still require opening each individual document to see what’s inside. While all these categories have their uses, there is really only one category of software I can recommend as the centerpiece of your second brain: digital notes apps. I believe that notes are the best metaphor for how we think about our creative work-in-process. Unlike other common terms such as documents, files, entries, cards, or records, notes have a natural home at the heart of our creative process. Notes are personal, informal, quick and dirty . They are not for public consumption, but for your own personal use, like a leather notebook you keep in your backpack. Notes are open-ended and never finished . “Taking notes” is a continuous process, in which you can noodle on ideas without an immediate purpose in mind. Notes have low standards for quality and polish. They are easy to jot down, because it’s fine if they are messy, incomplete, or totally random. Notes naturally mix diverse types of media . Just like a paper notebook might contain drawings and sketches, quotes and ideas, and even a pasted photo or Post-it(R), notes naturally combine different kinds of media in one place. All these features mean that notes apps are among the most freeform and flexible of all creative tools. They can be customized and adapted to suit exactly your style and your needs. This flexibility is crucial, because notes occupy the earliest stage of your creative process, when your ideas are still infants and need to be nurtured to adulthood. Digital notes apps give you the most important benefits of technology – searching, sharing, access on multiple devices, backups, editing, metadata, linking, copy-and-paste, and many others – while maintaining the blank canvas that every creative person needs to let their imagination run wild. A notes app is a “universal inbox” There will always be times and places to use specialized apps, including all the other apps for managing information I mentioned previously. The point of centralizing your knowledge management in one app is not to stop using all the others. It is to give you a secure foundation that you know you can always come back to. Because the strength of a notes app is saving content from a wide variety of sources, it can function as a “universal inbox” for capturing any kind of information coming your way. By paying close attention to a “home base” that you know you can always depend on, you’re free to strike out towards the frontier of knowledge, and experiment with the most cutting-edge new apps. Your home base should be stable, secure, and not make any dramatic changes. This is why it’s important to have a popular, well-supported app as the centerpiece of your second brain. You are free to try out any fancy new app as an experiment, but it’s important that your primary platform is one you can depend upon. Common pitfalls Before we go any further, I’d like to point out a few of the most common pitfalls I see as people adopt notes apps in their work and lives. Switching frequently between apps Every day, hundreds of new apps are launched, armed with slick marketing campaigns and bold visions. It is tempting to view each new product as a silver bullet, trusting that a team of crack engineers and designers has somehow “solved” knowledge management once and for all. As you can probably tell, I don’t put much stock in these hopes. There is a cost to switching apps, and I think it’s much better to invest in a trusted solution than to spend energy migrating from one place to another. What really matters is your output: what are you creating or producing out of this knowledge to make a difference in your career, your business, or the world? It’s doubtful that any mere feature set will dramatically improve the results you’re getting. My recommendation is to instead pick one well-established notes app, and invest in it for the long term. Trying to find one app to do everything It’s tempting to look for one app that can do “everything.” But why would you limit yourself to only the innovation coming from one company? I often use Asana for managing projects, Google Docs for shared brainstorming, and Mindnode for mapping out new topics. The job of your notes app is as a storage location for the things you learn and discover through these other projects. If your knowledge is better suited to a specialized app, by all means, keep it there. But if you complete a project or stop using one of them, be sure to bring that content back into your notes as a record of the work you’ve done. My recommendation is instead to always use the best tool for the job, but at the end of the day, save everything you want to keep in your notes app. Focusing too much on the long term As important as it is to preserve your notes over the long term, this can also become a pitfall. I’ve seen people spend so much energy creating multiple, totally secure backups, or using file types that will never change, that there’s no energy left over for creating! Remember that all this work is designed to make it easier to produce meaningful results. Don’t make a hobby out of engineering a system so resilient that it can survive a nuclear war! My recommendation is instead to balance short- and long-term perspectives, prioritizing doing good work in the medium term of the next few years. Waiting until you have the whole system perfectly figured out to get started This is perhaps the most common one, and the most problematic, especially among perfectionists. It’s understandable to feel anxiety and fear when embarking on such an important undertaking. It’s so tempting to try and have all the details perfectly worked out before you take the first step. But ultimately, you can’t know exactly what will work upfront. An approach that works for someone else may not necessarily work for you. The only way to build a second brain is to start small, and make incremental improvements over time. Trust yourself that you will learn and grow right with it. Which app is right for you? From my in-depth analysis, I’ve settled on one app as your best all-around option for building a second brain. Evernote was first introduced in 2008 and has been updated regularly since then—and with 225 million users it has by far the world’s largest community of note-takers. Many newer notes apps lack Evernote’s backend infrastructure, something that may not be cool but is nevertheless essential for creative work. Features such as linking, private and public sharing, syncing across devices, and a web version won’t make headlines, but are necessities for a knowledge management tool. Evernote also prioritizes what I believe to be the two most important technical aspects of a notes app: capture and search. These are two functions that users cannot do for themselves, and that rely the most on advanced technology. There are so many ways to get information into Evernote, and many integrations with other popular apps and platforms, so you always have the confidence that you can capture anything and find it again later . Lastly, I’ve spent a lot of time with the Evernote community and staff, and I believe that their culture and values are well-aligned with the needs of their customers. Their 3 Laws of Data Protection enshrine privacy and security as core values, assuring me that I will always own my data and that it won’t be sold to third parties. Do what works I’ve presented my strongest opinions and recommendations based on my experience, but what ultimately matters is that your approach works for you. A note is a blank canvas, just like a brand new notebook. It offers endless possibilities for those willing to experiment. But its ultimate purpose is to empower you to imagine, to create, and to take on creative ventures. I encourage you to leverage technology to its maximum potential, but to remember at the end of the day that your creativity is the only irreplaceable piece of the whole puzzle.

If you’re like most people, your life is buried under inbox overload. Despite your best intentions, emails keep coming…and coming…and coming. It’s easy to get overwhelmed when you’re faced with hundreds of unread messages. You know the information you need is somewhere in that pileup, but you don’t know where. Wouldn’t it be great if you had those emails organized in Evernote with the rest of your important information, so you can find them fast and take the next step? Bring the best out of your email The new Evernote for Gmail add-on allows you to select the important content from your inbox and place it in a note.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How Excessive Pressure Steals Your Productivity (and How to Take it Back)", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-pressure-breaks-habits-and-steals-productivity/", "abstract": "This is the fourth post in our series on productivity thieves, those habits and distractions preventing you from achieving your full potential. Check out our previous posts on ‘ fractured focus ,’ ‘ decision fatigue ,’ and ‘ toxic habits .’ If sticking with your same old routines is a walk in the park, then developing better routines is a journey into Mordor —at least, it can feel that way. Maybe increasing demands at work have shrunk your daily hour of distraction-free time to a mere twenty minutes. Or maybe you’d been hitting the gym regularly for months, until a stressful situation caused you to skip a few days—or weeks. In previous posts, we’ve suggested actions you can take to help boost your productivity. We’ve also offered ways to make these actions habitual, so you’re able to do them almost automatically. But what about when you have a good habit going—then life happens and it feels impossible to continue? What breaks your good habits? New routines are fragile. They might work fine at first, but under stress you tend to fall back into your old ways. If this has happened to you, go easy on yourself. It also happens to some of the most high-performing people in the world. Take the 2000 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Head coach Tony Dungy brought the team from perpetual losing streaks to within one game of the Super Bowl. He did this by altering their habits , so they responded to familiar situations with new (and better) routine behaviors. Why didn’t the Bucs make it all the way to the Super Bowl? Charles Duhigg, whose book “ The Power of Habit ” we’ve looked at before , points out that the players reverted to their old routines in the heat of high-stakes situations. In the book, Tony explains, “…we’d get to a big game and it was like the training disappeared. Afterward, my players would say, ‘Well, it was a critical play and I went back to what I knew.’…What they were really saying was that they trusted our system most of the time, but when everything was on the line, that belief broke down.” According to Charles Duhigg, belief is the key word here. He stresses the importance of trusting that your new routines will work even when there’s a lot riding on your performance. Of course, this is far more easily said than done—but there’s hope. How do you believe in your good habits? In short, join a like-minded community and think beyond yourself. Charles Duhigg points to research showing that group support helps people stick to new routines. One UC Berkeley study looked at group dynamics in Alcoholics Anonymous. Psychologist and researcher Lee Ann Kaskutas says, “People might be skeptical about their ability to change if they’re by themselves, but a group will convince them to suspend disbelief.” Community can also shift your focus to something outside of yourself, which can help you to stick to more productive routines. We said earlier that coach Tony Dungy never won the Super Bowl, at least, not with the Buccaneers. He won in 2007 with the Indianapolis Colts. The victory followed a devastating tragedy in Tony’s personal life: the loss of his son in 2005. In response, the players shifted focus from their individual self interest to their coach’s wellbeing and their team’s cohesion. One of the players explained, “I had spent a lot of previous seasons worrying about my contract and salary…When Coach came back, after the funeral, I wanted to give him everything I could…I kind of gave myself to the team.” Putting community ahead of self fostered trust among the team and, eventually, led to their success. This experience points to a crucial aspect of habitual behavior: Shifting your focus to a purpose beyond self interest helps you ingrain new routines. How do you make your productive habits more durable? Building belief in yourself and your new routines will help strengthen your willpower so that when high-pressure situations arrive (and they will), it’ll be easier for you to stick with your good habits. Here are some ways to do this: Talk to yourself This is not as strange as it might sound. You probably do it already—the “you idiot” under your breath when you spill a drink, the “I suck at life” when you’re rushing late to a meeting. Why not flip the script and say something different? According to University of Pennsylvania psychologist David Sarwer, addressing yourself with neutral language can improve self image . Using your name—rather than “I”—has been shown to help people see themselves more positively . And by getting away from negative self-talk, you can help reduce some of the pressure you put on yourself. So instead of saying, “I feel worthless because I’m too lazy to go to the gym” you might say, “[your name] is skipping the gym because she’s focusing on work today. The sky won’t fall if she goes tomorrow.” This might help you maintain belief in yourself when times get tough—and it’s no weirder than calling yourself a moron for dropping a cup of coffee. Avoid naysayers It turns out that beyond simply disliking other people’s negative behavior, you might be adopting it. Research from psychologists Elaine Hatfield and John Cacioppo suggests that people often mimic the body language, facial expressions, and word choices of others. The latter is especially true when the word choice is negatively charged . To protect your newly formed habits of productivity, avoid letting the bad habits of others rub off on you. It isn’t always practical to sever all negative relationships, but you might be able to minimize exposure to chronic naysayers. This is especially important if they tend to put down one of your new routines when you’re already feeling stressed. Sync up with others If your new productive routine is reading daily to foster a clearer mind , consider joining a book club. If you’re trying to quit smoking, find others who want to kick the habit with you. Participating in a community with like-minded individuals who share similar goals and experiences is one of the best things you can do to make a delicate new routine more automatic, and thus, easier to sustain in the face of unexpected challenges. As Lee Ann Kaskutas puts it, “There’s something really powerful about groups and shared experiences…A community creates belief.” Think beyond yourself Consider productive routines you might like to adopt. Want to avoid procrastination? Trying to improve focus or eat healthier meals? You’re probably not the only one who’ll benefit from a better you. What about your kids, or your partner? What about the people whose lives your work will change? When life throws you a curveball that makes it hard to stick with your new routine, think about them. In Charles Duhigg’s observation of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), the smallest personal sacrifices sometimes sparked life-long change. One reformed alcoholic mentions a pivotal moment at an AA meeting: “…someone asked for volunteers to help put away the chairs…I raised my hand. It wasn’t a big thing, it took like five minutes, but it felt good to do something that wasn’t all about me . I think that started me on a different path.” We’d like to come back to a thought we introduced at the beginning of this series: Act on what you know. You’re aware of the challenges you’re facing, and now you have new ideas and suggestions to help integrate more productive routines into your life. Set the wheels in motion and enjoy putting the best version of yourself in charge.", "date": "2019-08-30,"},

Well, today we’re going full nerd and offering you not just a few helpful tips, but eleven different ways to save things in Evernote. Each one will help you cut through the noise and focus on what you want to achieve. 1. Drag and drop This helps you gather important items in Evernote, so you can work with them in one place that’s relatively free of distraction. Grab a document, image, or other file on your computer, and drag it into Evernote. Drop the file in the note list, and Evernote saves it as a new note. To place the file inside a particular note, just open the note and drop it right in. Check out our tutorials on adding content to Evernote for Windows and Mac . Learn about attachments in notes » 2. Clip the web Ever click on a bookmark, only to find the page had changed—or disappeared completely? We feel your pain. Next time, use Web Clipper instead. Web Clipper is a browser extension that lets you save pages to Evernote. This preserves the page the way it was when you found it—no changes or maddening “Page not found” errors. Evernote even gives you image previews, so you can easily find the page you’re looking for, even if you forget its title. Pro tip: If you clip a page from Gmail, Amazon, YouTube, or LinkedIn , Web Clipper automatically saves what matters, trimming away the sidebars and other non-essential bits. Learn about Web Clipper » 3. Take a picture You’re at a café and you see a poster on the corkboard for a farmer’s market. You think, “I like heirloom tomatoes,” so you take a picture. But in no time, that picture is buried in your photos app, and you don’t see it again until tomato season is long gone. Instead, take a picture from within Evernote. Now you can add a reminder for the day of the farmer’s market. And you can search for any word in the image so you can easily find it later. Learn about adding pictures to notes » 4. Capture audio Ever been taking notes in a meeting or lecture and missed certain details? Maybe you were capturing an important insight but didn’t catch what was said next. Try using Evernote to record audio if you want to remember what was said while still giving the speaker your full attention. You can add comments in the same note, either while the audio is recording or when you play it back later. Learn how to record audio in a note » 5. Sketch on your phone or tablet For the times you’re thinking visually (or just want to give your thumbs a break), add sketches to your notes. Use sketches to draw diagrams in meeting notes or to capture moments of inspiration that don’t come in words. Just tap the pen icon in any note to get started. Learn about sketching in iOS or Android » 6. Send stuff from Gmail to Evernote (and vice versa) Say you’re taking a trip. Your travel details are spread out over a bunch of emails, and you have a trip checklist in Evernote. Rather than switching back and forth between Evernote and your inbox while rushing through the airport, bring the emails you need into Evernote, and see all things trip-related in one spot. Pro tip: Need to share your travel plans with someone else? Add the note with your trip details to an outgoing email, and send one message with everything in it to avoid cluttering the other person’s inbox. Learn about Evernote for Gmail and Outlook » 7. Integrate with Google Drive, Slack, Salesforce, and Microsoft Teams Switching between apps is a fact of life—it also kills your concentration.

Evernote’s integrations with Google Drive, Slack, Salesforce, and Microsoft Teams bring that world a little closer. Add Google Drive files to Evernote without leaving the note you’re working on. Each file shows up as a box with useful information like the filename and the last time it was modified, instead of links, which can be vague about where they lead. Does your company use Slack for private chats or group conversations? If so, you can create notes, find existing notes, and clip conversations into Evernote while you’re working in Slack. Access Evernote content from within Salesforce . Gather everything you need, from scanned business cards to sales collateral, in one convenient place. Notes sync automatically, and they’re searchable in both Evernote and Salesforce. Get information from Evernote into Microsoft Teams without leaving a chat thread.

You can check out our first post, on ‘fractured focus,’ here . Ever sat in a meeting and had the awful realization you don’t need to be there? You were told to be there, but what’s going on just doesn’t pertain to you. While some lucky few can leave , you’re more than likely stuck watching the clock. Unfortunately, you’re probably losing more than time. As you listen to your colleagues problem-solve toward a decision, maybe part of your mind joins in. Or maybe you furtively glance at your inbox and debate whether or not you can fire off an email without being noticed. It’ll just look like I’m taking notes, right? Either way, this deliberation over choices that don’t really matter makes it harder to devote your most creative reasoning to the choices that do. Today we’ll look at what happens when you take on superfluous decisions and offer you five ways to pick your battles, so you can accomplish your goals. What is decision fatigue? Decision fatigue, also known as choice overload, is the diversion of your finite mental resources to excessive or nonessential problem solving. Think about how often you’re faced with extraneous decisions—the unnecessary meeting that asks you to chew on a problem that isn’t really yours, the surprise assignment from your manager that forces you to weigh options for reallocating your time. The more things like this happen, the more you might have a nagging feeling that your most important work is suffering. Science agrees with that nagging feeling. In his book, “ The Shallows ,” Nicholas Carr explores the work of prominent brain researchers to find out how splitting up your problem-solving energy across multiple decisions affects your quality of work. One such researcher is Stanford professor Clifford Nass, who conducted a study to find out what happens when you deliberate on multiple problems at once. Clifford and his team gave cognitive tests to a group of people who routinely engaged in multitasking and another group who did relatively little multitasking. The result? The heavy multitaskers were more easily distracted and found it harder to concentrate—to the point that Clifford called them “suckers for irrelevancy.” Nicholas Carr also points to research showing that even seemingly insignificant decisions can have a real effect on your productivity. These can be so subtle, you might not even realize you’re exerting mental effort. For example, in 2008, UCLA psychiatry professor, Gary Small, found that experienced web surfers had increased activity in prefrontal areas of the brain associated with problem solving and decision making, as compared with people who read more print media. The takeaway, according to Nicholas Carr, is that “Whenever we, as readers, come upon a link, we have to pause, for at least a split second, to allow our prefrontal cortex to evaluate whether or not we should click on it. The redirection of our mental resources, from reading words to making judgments, may be imperceptible to us—our brains are quick—but it’s been shown to impede comprehension and retention, particularly when it’s repeated frequently.” How can you fight decision fatigue? We’ve just discussed the two ways decision fatigue steals your productivity: One is obvious, robbing your mental energy in broad daylight by giving you decisions that require conscious effort. The other is more of a burglar, sneaking off with it by presenting you with countless barely perceptible decisions online. With this in mind, here are five ways to direct your problem-solving ability where you want it to go: Clearly define a problem, then walk away from it. The old idea of “sleeping on” a problem really can help you solve it. In fact, even just switching your focus to a less demanding task can help, if you do it the right way. Work from Dutch psychologist, Ap Dijksterhuis, suggests that when we shift our attention away from a tough problem, we continue working on it unconsciously . But this only happens if you engage with the problem first. So spend some time trying to solve the problem, then have a goal in mind before stepping away. Schedule recurring tasks for the same time. Many of your decisions relate to things you do on a regular basis. Every day you decide when you’re going to plan for dinner or when to catch up with email. In the book “ Deep Work, ” author Cal Newport suggests removing scheduling decisions for recurring tasks to take unnecessary problem-solving off your plate. For example, you might respond to email at 4 p.m. every weekday or hit the gym every Monday and Wednesday at 6. Establishing these kinds of routines can help you do more and deliberate less. Choose a daily highlight. Do one thing every day that you’ll look back on and say, “That was the highlight of my day.” This idea comes from Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky, whose book “ Make Time ” gives practical suggestions for improving focus. They suggest finding a task each day that is either the most urgent, satisfying, or joyful thing you can do, ideally in about 90 minutes. This practice can help you focus on the decisions that really serve you and avoid spreading your problem-solving ability too thin. Use reading mode on your browser. So many web pages siphon off your attention by asking you to perform small but constant deliberations. You tend to have better retention when you absorb a single piece of content from start to finish before moving on to something else. More and more browsers now offer some type of “reading mode” that blocks multimedia content and makes it easier to pay attention to what you’re reading. Read books on paper. Reading print material on a regular basis rests your decision-making mind and frees you to focus on one unbroken train of thought. Nicholas Carr touches on this when he says, “By allowing us to filter out distractions, to quiet the problem-solving functions of the frontal lobes, deep reading becomes a form of deep thinking. The mind of the experienced book reader is a calm mind, not a buzzing one.” You don’t have to quit online reading completely. But for a few minutes every night, close your laptop, silence your phone, and enjoy a good (physical) book instead. Remember, these tips aren’t an all-or-nothing proposition. We love giving you lots of actionable advice, but we don’t want to create the very kind of overwhelm we’re trying to help you avoid in the first place. Try the strategies that look promising to you.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "5 Journaling Prompts for Self-Reflection and Discovery", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/journal-prompts-self-reflection-discovery/", "abstract": "Most of us don’t blurt out every thought that enters our minds—which is probably for the best. But just because you don’t share certain ideas or feelings doesn’t mean you shouldn’t express them at all. Journaling lets you explore things you otherwise wouldn’t. This self-reflection can lift your mood and improve your problem-solving ability. Unfortunately, the freedom to say anything can often be paralyzing. For many people, staring at a blank page is so daunting they never actually start writing. So here are five journal prompts to help you on your own journey toward self-discovery. A daily sentence Yep, that’s it—one sentence a day. It might be a brief description of your emotional state or a childhood memory that keeps nudging its way into your consciousness. This prompt is helpful if you want to journal regularly but struggle to find the time. According to James Clear, author of “ Atomic Habits ,” keeping the workload light can help establish journaling as something you do day in, day out without much effort. Once you ingrain journaling as a habit, you might find it’s easy to write more than your one requisite sentence. If you’re really pressed for time, try keeping your journal in Evernote. That way you can add your daily sentence wherever you are, on any device, without having to carry a physical notebook around with you. Since each entry is short, you can type it on your phone whenever you have a spare minute. Pro tip: You can record your daily sentence as a voice memo . This lets you journal even when writing isn’t an option. Get an idea while walking the dog or making dinner? Record it in Evernote, and it saves to your journal automatically. Morning pages Write three pages as soon as you wake up. Yes, before your shower, before your espresso forte, and definitely before your battle with the morning commute. This strategy comes from Julia Cameron, author of “ The Artist’s Way .” She explains that most of us have mental defenses that suppress negative thoughts and feelings. Once in place, these defenses take effort to maintain, requiring you to spend precious mental energy throughout the day. Morning pages are a way to purge this negativity before your defenses have a chance to kick in. With these negative thoughts out of the way (or at least off to the side), you might discover a new state of mind that serves you better. Three pages sounds like a lot, but this writing is strictly a stream of consciousness. Switch topics. Repeat yourself. Commit atrocious spelling errors. The grammar police aren’t allowed to comment. If it still feels daunting to meet a page count, a time limit can be just as effective. Try setting a timer for five minutes and write as much as you can before the buzzer. Daily recharge Keeping a journal and re-reading it periodically can help you identify patterns in your behavior and observe how you grow over time. If mornings are out of the question or you want something more structured, try doing some self-reflection in the evening with a daily recharge. This involves writing about specific events that occurred throughout your day. You might address your achievements, challenges, relationships, or any self-discoveries that occur to you as you write. Psychotherapist Maud Purcell recommends re-reading these kinds of journal entries later, saying that “certain portions of the journal will seem more relevant to your life as a whole, and easy access to these areas will be helpful, especially during times of life confusion or distress.” To get started quickly, check out Evernote’s daily recharge template . It sets up multiple prompts for you, so you don’t have to confront the abyss of the empty page. Just apply the template to any note and start journaling. Pro tip: After you write an entry in Evernote, tag it with a few of the topics you covered. When you’re ready to re-read your journal later, you can see every entry that mentions a particular idea, issue, or emotion. Gratitude journal Write five things you’re grateful for every day. These can range from the simplest pleasures to the most important people and events in your life. For example, you might list things that made you laugh throughout the day or describe something a friend or family member did that you admire. Studies from the University of Minnesota and the University of Florida suggest that listing positive events that occurred at the end of each day can help reduce stress and promote a sense of calm at night. So this might be a good practice if anxious thoughts about the day’s events tend to keep you awake. Evernote’s gratitude journal template prompts you to reflect on the people and events that have made a difference in your life and to draw lessons or takeaways from your experiences. Pro tip: In addition to suggestions for writing at the end of the day, the template also includes a morning gratitude prompt, so you can gather thoughts from the start and end of your day in one place. Address the negative (in doses) Journaling about negative thoughts, feelings, and experiences can help you overcome them. According to psychologist James Pennebaker, writing about troubling or traumatic experiences can improve your mood even more than journaling about everyday topics. But he cautions against habitually ruminating on negativity. He explains that journaling about a difficult experience over and over in the same way usually doesn’t help people feel better. In order for journaling on these topics to work, James says, “There has to be growth, change, or closure in the way they view their experiences.” He recommends writing about negative experiences or thoughts for 15-30 minutes for three or four days. If you don’t start feeling better, look for other ways to cope . Keeping a journal and re-reading it periodically can help you identify patterns in your behavior and observe how you grow over time. According to Maud Purcell , the benefit of this kind of self-reflection is that “When current circumstances appear insurmountable, you will be able to look back on previous dilemmas that you have since resolved.” Apply these five journal prompts today to make expressive writing and self-discovery part of your daily life.", "date": "2019-10-16,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "6 Ways to Save Money in College", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/college-budget-living/", "abstract": "While it’s tough to squirrel away extra funds in college, it doesn’t get much easier after you graduate. Americans at almost all income levels have a hard time setting money aside. But it is possible to save money in the face of growing college expenses and constant spending temptations… even if you’re not necessarily swimming in cash to begin with. Here are six tips to help you save money in college, no matter how hard it might seem. Set a goal That feeling when you check your bank account balance and see a much smaller number than you expected? To say the least, it sucks. Fortunately, there’s a way to avoid it: Set a spending target and stay under it. The best way to stay under your target is to create a budget. This will help you see how much money you have coming in, how much you need to spend, and how much you actually spend. Thankfully, there’s an Evernote template to help you, so all you have to do is fill in the blanks. Once you know what’s left over after you take care of your monthly expenses, set a weekly spending target—one you hopefully won’t exceed, but that allows you a reasonable level of comfort. Pro Tip: Even though you’re tracking monthly expenses, we suggest setting a weekly target. It requires you to check your finances more often, which makes you more aware of your spending habits and can help you save money. Reward your success Review your finances each week. If you spent under your target, deposit what’s left over into your savings account. Most banks have an app to make this part easier. Then record your success in a visible way. Maybe you make a checkmark on a wall calendar, or put a small sticker on your laptop, or use Evernote’s habit tracking template. Now, whenever you look at your calendar, laptop, or habit tracker you’ll see your wins accumulate. This might seem like a small thing, but finding ways to gamify your finances can make saving money feel good , which helps encourage you to stick to your plan. Get cheap (or free) books Textbooks are one of the heftiest college expenses any student will face. Before you drop a bunch of cash at your college bookstore, head to the library first. Try to figure out your required texts as early as possible and check them out before other students beat you to it. A lot of professors even put their textbooks on reserve in the campus library (check your syllabi to see if they mention it). And don’t forget to check your local library, too—you can usually do that online. While you’re reading your syllabi, see if you’re able to choose between physical books or e-books—this can open up a world of cheaper options . Many libraries offer e-books for various tablets or e-readers . Some titles you’ll probably have to get at the college bookstore. An easy way to save money here is to pick up used copies. Most college bookstores put out discounted used books, if available, alongside the new copies. Many will also buy certain books back from you at the end of the term, so check with yours to find out if they have a buyback program and which of your texts might be eligible. Use student discounts When you’re a student, people often throw discounts at you without your even knowing it. Of course, you have to be careful. A five-percent discount on a Sony PlayStation isn’t saving you money as much as it’s baiting you to spend it. But if you stick to buying things you really need, student discounts can really help you out. When you see a student discount, ask yourself, “Is this a college expense I’d have to buy even if it were full price?” If so, it might be worth it. If you’re buying something you need at a shop near campus, check to see if they have a student discount. It’s also worth searching the web for student discounts on things you purchase online. Here are two thorough lists from The Simple Dollar and College Info Geek . Pro Tip : If you’re a current Evernote Basic customer, or have been thinking about signing up, here’s a student discount you can’t ignore! Save automatically You check your bank account and see more money just arrived, maybe from financial aid, a student job, or helpful family members. Whatever the source, when you’re faced with a fresh lump sum of cash, it can be a real challenge to put some of it aside. There’s a simple hack for this: Save your money before you see it. Most banks have plans that transfer part of your income into your savings account automatically. There are also savings apps that will round up your debit card purchases to the nearest dollar and save the difference for you. Let’s say you buy a coffee for $1.25. The app will round that purchase up to $2.00 and deposit $0.75 into an account without you having to do a thing. Pro Tip: Not enough savings? Most of these apps let you round up to higher amounts. But you might be surprised how quickly your savings accumulate even if you’re just rounding to the nearest dollar. Cook your own meals According to Money Under 30 , a meal that costs $13 at a restaurant costs only $4 to prepare at home. The temptation to eat out is especially high in college, where you’re either studying so often it’s hard to break away and make dinner, or you’re out with friends a lot and visiting restaurants becomes a fun social activity. But cooking at home doesn’t mean you have to survive on energy drinks and instant ramen. If you’re constantly pressed for time, try setting aside one or two days per week to cook a lot of portions of simple meals at once. Stack these up in portable containers in the fridge (with your name on them if you have roommates). Then you’ll have something you can grab quickly for the next few days on your way out the door, and you’ll be saving money on every meal you prepare yourself. If you don’t want to miss out on eating as a social activity, try arranging a group to cook and eat together. If it’s hard to get people motivated, learn to make a popular dish really well and share it with your friends. You might find this helps sway them into having a ritual practice of dining in. If any of these methods help you save money during your college years, take one final step and try not to spend it! If you can, use the following rule of thumb: whenever you save money on something, figure out what you would have spent had you paid full price, then deposit the difference into your savings account. Do that on a regular basis and your future self will thank you.", "date": "2019-09-26,"},

Check out our previous posts on ‘ fractured focus ’ and ‘ decision fatigue . ‘ Have you ever gotten to work and not remembered how you got there? You must have brushed your teeth, taken a shower, and fought through traffic, but you don’t recall doing any of it. This can happen because your morning routine is a habit requiring barely any conscious thought—and it’s probably not the only one. What about the mid-morning cheese danish, the procrastination before a big project, or the hours of social media that beat out visits to the gym? If you consciously choose routines like these because they bring you fulfillment, then have at it! But if you do them without really thinking or when you’d rather do something else, ask yourself: What if, instead, you could put the productive behaviors you want to adopt on autopilot? Today, we’re exploring how you can make productive habits more automatic and giving you four steps for creating better routines. Note: If we had you at “productive” and you’re ready to dive into action, go right ahead . How do we form habits? “When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in conscious thought.” —Charles Duhigg In his book “ The Power of Habit ,” author Charles Duhigg looks at the science of habit formation and describes it as a behavioral loop with three parts: A cue that triggers your brain to behave automatically A routine that consists of some kind of action A reward that reinforces the loop by giving you a good feeling So a cue might be an anxious feeling you get when an involved project lands on your desk. The anxiety causes a craving for relief that you satisfy with the routine of, say, eating a cheese danish. The danish gives you a reward—a feeling of pleasure that momentarily relieves the anxiety. The more you satisfy a given craving with the same routine, the more your brain relegates that habit loop to some of its more primitive regions, which are able to override your conscious (that is, better ) judgment. Nicholas Carr , who we’ve referred to before in this series, points out that “…as we repeat an experience, the synaptic links between the neurons responsible for it grow stronger and more plentiful.” He adds that even though this repetition helps us gain new skills, “it can also entrench undesirable habits.” Charles Duhigg explains this entrenchment further, saying, “When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in conscious thought.” How do you break the habit loop? The good news is that the habit loop is an ancient system that isn’t changing any time soon. That makes it predictable. And because it’s possible to make almost any routine an automatic behavior, the same ability to act unconsciously that can cause you to look at your phone for hours after you tell yourself to stop can also work for you. According to Charles Duhigg, “…to change an old habit, you must address an old craving. You have to keep the same cues and rewards as before, and feed the craving by inserting a new routine .” (emphasis added) With that in mind, here are four steps to change up your routines: Observe and record First, simply be aware of your routines. Notice when you take an unproductive action by force of habit. In that moment, ask yourself, What cued me to take that action? What reward is that action giving me? Then write it all down. Studies from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggest that logging your behavior can significantly increase your chances of changing it . Researchers studying weight loss at the NIH found that when people kept a daily log of everything they ate, they lost twice as much weight as those who didn’t. For the logging itself, there’s an app for that . Win small You’re more likely to change an unproductive habit if you set your sights on one routine to reform. The new routine should be something specific that will present you with small wins—tiny but noticeable improvements. According to Charles Duhigg, small wins help you see results on a regular basis. This helps convince you that progress is possible. It also makes it more likely that the routine you’re about to reshape leads to other productive habit changes. For example, setting a routine like “make healthier choices” might not work so well. It’s too vague. A more specific routine like “take a walk every time a danish craving strikes” will be more likely to stick. Switch routines Now that you know what routine you want to change, you can substitute it into your habit loop. It’s important that you do the new routine in response to the old cue and that you receive the same reward. So let’s say your current habit loop is: Cue: a feeling of anxiety when a major project lands on your desk. Routine: eating a cheese danish. Reward: a momentary feeling of relief. Your new habit loop could be: Cue: a feeling of anxiety when a major project lands on your desk. Routine: going for a walk. Reward: a momentary feeling of relief. No, going for a walk won’t taste as good and it won’t give you a sugar rush, but it doesn’t have to. All it has to do is give you a small sense of relief. Make a chain Once you’ve started doing your new routine in response to an old cue, give yourself a visible way to acknowledge your success. Jerry Seinfeld famously placed a big red X on his calendar for every day he wrote new jokes. Soon the Xs formed a chain. “Just keep at it,” he says, “and the chain will grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.” Think of ways to associate your new routine with objects that add up over time. For example, if your new routine is to journal every day, maybe you tear a corner off a journal page and tack it to the wall every time you do your daily writing. Whatever your chain might be, put it somewhere prominent, so it serves as a reminder of your achievements. The power of habit is that it can turn challenging life changes into automatic behaviors. Major shifts won’t happen overnight, but small wins can. If you’re trying to adopt advice from previous posts in this series or wanting to embrace any new productive behavior, the steps above can help you make it happen without it feeling like an uphill battle.", "date": "2019-08-20,"},

That sounds easy, but doing it requires more than simply reading another book about focus. The more we look into productivity —how to achieve it and why we keep losing it—the clearer it is that a lack of information isn’t the problem. The problem is acting on what you already know, on putting that informed and inspired version of yourself at the helm. We all have habits that rob us of our concentration and waste our time. To help you overcome them, we’re doing a series of posts that break down the worst of these productivity thieves and give you concrete actions to help you do more with less effort. What exactly is fractured focus? Fractured focus is the division of your attention across multiple tasks. And nothing divides our attention quite like the internet. Let’s establish that we love the internet. No amount of trolling, or unprovoked DDoS attacks , or hard-hitting exposés is going to change what’s good about the web: It’s the most powerful tool for human exchange ever created, spurring the sharing of knowledge and expression more than any other technology. Evernote exists in part to help people discover their own superpowers by capturing relevant parts of this knowledge and making them their own . But capturing the right information means separating the signal from a ton of noise. The online attention economy incentivizes everyone, not just advertisers, to capture eyeballs and rack up quantifiable bits of engagement. Hence the steady stream of banner ads, auto-playing videos, eye-catching animations, screen-filling pop-ups, bright red notifications badges, and cheerful chimes signaling potential good news. The point here is not that these things are bad or wrong—just that they’re diversions . In his book, “ Deep Work ,” author Cal Newport points out that so-called “directed attention,” the kind of attention you use when doing intellectual work, is a finite resource. Like any other resource, you deplete it as you use it. And if you overuse it, it can be exhausted, making concentrated focus practically impossible until you rest and recharge. So if your directed attention is a river, each tiny distraction (a text, a notification, a pop-up) is a rivulet that diverts part of the flow. If your only rivulet was the occasional phone call—splitting off a small slice of your attention a few times a day—not a huge problem. But chances are, you deal with a lot more than that . Think about how many distractions you experience in a day—in an hour. Does your focus resemble a wide stream with one or two tiny spurs diverging from the main source? Or is it all spurs, all thin little rivulets scattered in different directions? If you’ve ever felt like you’re always starting and restarting on a project, continually leaving it to answer email or check social media, never able to really dig in and make progress, then fractured focus might be a problem. Author Nicholas Carr describes this problem in his book “ The Shallows .” He explores the growing consensus among brain researchers that the kind of constant distraction we get from the web fragments our thinking, making it harder for us to stay on task. According to Carr, “The Net’s cacophony of stimuli short-circuits both conscious and unconscious thought, preventing our minds from thinking either deeply or creatively.” What can you do about it? If you’ll indulge us in one last grandiose water metaphor, there’s some good news: Your focus is not evaporating into thin air, it’s just deviating from your most important work. Here are four ways to take your focus back and pay attention to what’s important: Do your more mentally demanding tasks early in the work day. If you have to fire off a couple quick emails first thing in the morning, fine. But get to the focus-intensive stuff before you get sucked into a string of shallower low-intensity activities. According to Newport, it takes very little willpower to switch from a deep focus task to a shallow focus one. But going the other direction—from shallow to deep focus—is much harder, so save tasks that don’t require a lot of mental effort for later in your day. Carve out distraction-free time. We’re not suggesting you check email just four times a year—although that’s a thing . Instead, start small, but start now. Pick a day this week to give yourself one hour with no distractions. During this time, turn off the phone, close the email application, and shut down everything that might randomly tap you on the shoulder. Choose a project you’re working on and set a goal you can realistically achieve in an hour. When the hour is up, take a look at your results. If you like what you see, can you push it to two hours next time? Maybe a few times a week? Quit distractions you don’t need. Twitter might legitimately help you accomplish something vital to your goals. If so, use it! Same goes for any social media or networking tool, but do you really need ALL of them? And do you need their notification settings dialed to full blast all the time? Probably not. Take a close look at the tools you’re using and ask yourself, “Has this tool furthered my career or life goals in the last six months?” If not, delete the app. Don’t worry, you can always add it back later, but notice if your focus improves when you streamline your tools. Go for nature walks. Enjoying a stroll in nature has been shown to help replenish your stores of attention. Why nature and not a busy city street? Cities confront you with stimuli that demand your directed attention—interpreting flashing signs, making eye contact with drivers to read their intentions, avoiding shoulder checks from people pouring out of subway exits. Assuming your nature walk is not in a particularly treacherous environment, it doesn’t make these kinds of demands. Instead, it occupies your focus just enough to prevent it from zeroing in on something else. This gives your directed attention a chance to regenerate. Okay, but… Some days you can’t just unplug. Some days there are sick kids, office emergencies, and need-to-know information that might arrive any second. So the inroads to your attention must, alas, stay wide open. For these times, we recommend a strategy from Tiago Forte, who takes a distinctly different approach from the practitioners of deep focus. Instead of trying to avoid distractions, he advocates accepting them gracefully. He suggests adjusting your goals so that you work in short bursts towards objectives you can achieve in small amounts of time. For example, instead of trying to write a ten-page proposal in one sitting, try to finish just the attention-grabbing opening lines or the key bit of research that supports one of the main points. Forte calls these easy-to-finish objectives “intermediate packets.” They aren’t completed projects. They’re pieces of projects that can be assembled later into a coherent whole. By shrinking the amount of work we bite off at a given time, we make it easier to make concrete progress, and, crucially, our jobs become a little more tolerant of distraction, a little less disturbed by the noise on the days where silence isn’t an option. As you explore ways to reclaim your productivity, take action early and often. And remember: The suggestions above are not steps . Don’t feel like you have to do them all or in any particular order. Take what sounds doable for you, work it into your routine and stick with it awhile. Disregard what doesn’t work and try something new, until your own path starts becoming clear.", "date": "2019-08-5,"},

This belief guides his work as the founder of Forte Labs, creator of the Productive by Design™ methodology, and editor of the Praxis online publication. Tiago draws on his background in design and technology to help organizations apply design thinking to day-to-day productivity challenges. He will be teaching an online class, Building a Second Brain : Unlock Your Creative Potential Using Evernote, beginning January 16. Note-Taking Apps as the Next Frontier of Creative Productivity Consider a typical working session of a couple hours. You set aside the time, silence your phone, and clear your desk, determined to finish some Work of Real Value. We know that time always passes at the same, unforgiving pace. And since time costs money, we could graph the two of them together like so: Now consider the state of flow that you hope to get into to produce this Work of Real Value. We know that the first stage of flow is “struggle,” as your brain situates to the environment and “loads” the information relevant to the task at hand. So your experience of flow over a couple hours looks something like this: Notice how the flow curve dips below the time/money curve at the beginning. This is why setting aside a big block of time feels risky. If you’re going to spend that much time, you’d better have something to show for it. Now let’s consider your energy level. This obviously depends on a lot of factors, but it’s safe to say that it starts towards the top of the range, and ends toward the bottom: Notice where the energy and flow curves intersect. Essentially, your goal in the beginning of the session is to use your high energy to overcome the “struggle” stage. You’re hoping to leap onto and climb the cliff of flow before your energy drops too low or time runs out: Now let’s add “value created.” This is definitely the most uncertain, but I would argue that virtually all the value in the typical individual working session is created at the very end: One minute before you export that design and send it to the client, no value has been created. One minute before you attach your report to an email and send it to your boss with an explanatory note, no value has been created. One minute before your lovingly crafted product has been opened by your customer, no value has been created. The goal of any employee’s working session, from your employer’s point of view, is for the value curve to intersect the time/money curve. If it doesn’t, you’ve spent more time and your company has spent more money than the value that was created. If value created exceeds time/money, that is what’s known as a “very productive day.” With this simple (if totally unscientific) graph in hand, we can understand the modern productivity landscape. Every major “school” of productivity thought can be defined in terms of which curve it attempts to bend, and how. The “Energy School” offers a variety of ways to get that energy curve higher. Better diet, more or different exercises, stretching and yoga, better sleep. If you can just keep your energy level high enough, their argument goes, your productivity will be great. The “Focus School” is all about getting into and staying in flow. Meditation, goal-setting exercises, prioritizing schemes, avoiding distractions, no-meeting or no-phone days, accountability mechanisms, noise-canceling headphones, and many others. They argue that the best strategy is to pick a task and then hammer away at it until it’s finished, extending that flow curve as long as possible. The “Efficiency School” is obsessed with the logistics of work. It advocates using technology or other people to automate tasks, learning keyboard shortcuts, improving reading and writing speed, ruthlessly cutting out all unnecessary activities, moving to Bali to cut down expenses, and other methods of cramming more productivity into the given amount of time and money represented by the time/money curve. Now watch what happens when we don’t have a big block of time to set aside, or that block of time gets interrupted. In other words, the typical situation faced by most workers on most days: Breaking our day into smaller segments has no effect on the time/money spent. You’re paid a fixed amount to be there a certain number of hours, regardless of how they’re divided up. And there isn’t much effect on the energy curve either. You’re still tired at the end of the day, no matter how many or few sessions you’ve had. The real impact of breaking up our day into smaller segments is on flow, or the lack thereof: Since we don’t have enough time in one stretch to get into flow, we spend most of our day in struggle. We feel as if we’re interrupted from the current interruption by yet another interruption. This is how you can work hard all day, yet walk away with the distinct impression you didn’t get anything done. Here’s a radical idea: what if this new workplace environment we find ourselves in is actually a good thing? What if we saw the constant stimulation not as interruptions and distractions, but as opportunities for rich feedback and connection? What if we used online networks as platforms for learning and collaboration, not as procrastination devices? In other words, instead of fighting the direction the world is moving — drinking more coffee, cutting off our access to technology, and trying to force ourselves to focus — wouldn’t it be easier to flow with it? Or possibly even use it to our advantage? I’d like to start a new school of productivity, the Value School. Its objective will be to shift the curve that usually gets taken for granted: the “value created” curve. What we need to do is change the shape and size of the value curve to match the pace at which modern work moves. Instead of delivering value in a big package that spans huge amounts of time and money, we deliver it in smaller chunks at more frequent intervals: This idea, of course, isn’t new. In the world of manufacturing, it is the equivalent of small batch sizes, a key part of the Just-In-Time vision that has propelled Toyota through 7 decades of growth to become the world’s largest automaker. In the world of software, it is known as continuous integration and deployment, a practice that has revolutionized the speed and quality with which the software we use every day is developed. In the startup world, Eric Ries has shown us in his book The Lean Startup how delivering value quickly in small chunks is essential for learning and innovation. But we lack a framework for how individual employees can use small batch sizes to their advantage. If each worker in this new economy really is a Company of One, wouldn’t it make sense for us to use the same approach that has revolutionized manufacturing, software development, and startups? What is keeping us from realizing this vision, I believe, is a mistaken assumption. This assumption is revealed when we ask the question: What is the “inventory” of  knowledge work? What is the information age equivalent to the raw materials that flow through a factory? The typical response is that “tasks” are the inventory of knowledge work. Many productivity strategies (like kanban boards) set “limits on work-in-process inventory” by limiting the number of open tasks that are allowed to be worked on at any given time. “Focus on one thing at a time!” we’re told. But tasks are not inventory — they are nothing but abstract units of organization. No company “sells” tasks to their customers, and no employer will pay you for a completed to do list. The inventory of knowledge work is ideas. What you are selling, as a “worker of knowledge,” are the ideas you’ve “processed” through the focused application of your attention. I think this makes people uncomfortable, because ideas are hard to quantify. We often hear that “ideas are cheap; only execution matters” and thus feel more comfortable in the execution of tasks than the generation of new ideas. Tasks are simpler, with only two possible states: done and undone. Whereas ideas exist on a much murkier spectrum of grays. Even our job titles designate certain people as “creatives,” with the rest presumably not expected to have any ideas. If ideas are the inventory of knowledge work, then reducing our batch sizes requires changing not how we manage tasks and projects, but how we manage the information content of those projects . We need to change our conception of what we are producing, from final deliverables to what I will call “intermediate packets.” Instead of seeing the final product (the deliverable we sell to the client) as the only repository of value, we package up all the intermediate steps — the research, notes, brainstorms, examples, outlines, prototypes, drafts, and even crazy ideas we choose not to pursue — as reusable components for later consumption. At the end of the project, instead of making one final crazy all-night push to load every single part of the project into our brain for final delivery, our task is much easier: final assembly of the previously built packets. This approach has numerous benefits: 1. Create value in any span of time If we see our work as creating these intermediate packets, we can find ways to create value in any span of time, no matter how short. Productivity becomes a game of matching each available block of time with a corresponding packet of value. Actually finishing things is critical to our motivation and morale. Why not redefine our work in smaller units that give us this feeling of completion at a more consistent pace? 2. Less intimidating Big, ambitious projects are risky, because all the time you spend on it will feel like a waste if you don’t succeed. Often we don’t even attempt the big ones, because the path from here to there seems impossibly long and tortuous. But if your only goal is to create an intermediate packet and show it to someone — good notes on a book, a Pinterest board of design inspirations, just one module of code — then you can trick yourself into getting started. And even if that particular Big Project doesn’t pan out, you’ll still have the value of the packets at your disposal. 3. Become interruption-proof Organizing your work in intermediate packets has an extraordinary effect: you become interruption-proof. Because you rarely even try to load the entire project into your mind at once, there isn’t much to lose if someone taps you on the shoulder. You can even start to see interruptions as a good thing: they remind you not to take on too much at once, to check in with others, to clear your mind and take a break once in awhile. 4. Better feedback Another impact of breaking up your work into smaller chunks is that you can stop more often to get feedback. This is a critical skill as the pace of change in the marketplace accelerates. Part of the packaging of an intermediate chunk is that it becomes legible — others can get a sense of what it is and what it means, unlike your 25 pages of messy notes in a Google Doc. And a much less appreciated consequence: people are more willing to give honest feedback on something that is merely work-in-process, whereas they’re hesitant to critique something that looks highly polished. 5. Productivity flywheel After you’ve been working this way for awhile, there is a final benefit: you gain the ability to complete entire projects merely by assembling previously created packets. There seems to be a critical mass in a given industry or area — once you reach that mass, each additional packet added creates exponential value in the connections it creates with others. This is the mythical productivity flywheel—a system that produces value almost on its own, while you take a back seat as curator, manager, and gatekeeper. So what is required to make this new approach a reality? It requires us to get much, much better at packaging our work mid-stream. Here’s what makes it difficult: we can’t afford to do this packaging during the project, because every spare moment is needed to race toward the deadline. And we can’t do it after the project ends, because by then we’re already off to the next one. No, this packaging has to be embedded into the actual way we work moment to moment, so that it doesn’t take any extra time whatsoever. This need for a new way of defining, packaging, and delivering knowledge work is why I believe the humble category of note-taking apps represents the next frontier of productivity. Their purpose is much different from file storage services like Box, Dropbox, and iCloud, as well as cloud-based suites like Google Drive and Microsoft Office 360. They don’t optimize for finished documents ready to be printed, or for convenient groupings of project files, or storage space or speed or collaboration or any of the other things one could optimize for. Instead, they optimize for productive randomness , for serendipity, for seemingly bizarre juxtapositions of apparently unconnected information to train our capacity for connecting it. Each person possesses a unique lifestream of information from numerous sources, and success increasingly depends on curating, tweaking, redirecting, and capturing value from this stream to use in our work. Instead of hiding our insights and learnings in neatly labeled folders and files, we want to expose them as intermediate packets of ever-evolving, intermediate work. Note-taking apps, simply put, are our best option for “bending” productivity to the ebb and flow of our days, and for managing the work-in-process inventory of ideas that represents our main asset as knowledge workers.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "6 Ways to Have More Productive Meetings (Yes, it Can Happen)", "author": ["Emily Esposito"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/6-ways-productive-meetings-yes-can-happen/", "abstract": "Bing! That’s right. You just got another calendar invite. Your last free block of time to do actual work is gone. Don’t get us wrong – there can be great value in meeting with your team face-to-face rather than sending half a dozen emails. However, there are also those meetings where direction is lacking, no decisions are made, and you’re left wondering what the point of it all was. (Not-so) Breaking news: we all attend too many meetings Just like email, conference calls, and less-than-great coffee, meetings have always been a necessary evil in the workplace. However, there are signs that the meeting epidemic is getting worse. It’s estimated that there are 11 million meetings in the U.S. each day, and according to research, at least a third of them are unproductive. In a survey conducted by Evernote and YouGov*, one in five U.S. respondents said that they have either somewhat or far too many meetings at work, the highest of any country surveyed. What can you do to avoid back-to-back meetings every single day? And how can you make the meetings you do attend worthwhile? Here are six simple tactics to make meetings more productive and manageable. 1. Take back control of your calendar We all have those pockets of time when we do our best work . For some, maximum productivity hits first thing in the morning, right after that cup of coffee. For others, mornings may be the time to catch up on emails, while afternoons are saved for peak creativity. Whatever your rhythm is, don’t let meetings get in the way. Block your calendar to maximize your most productive time of day and save meetings for the lulls. Or, schedule all your meetings on certain days of the week (like Tuesdays and Thursdays, for example), so you are free to work uninterrupted for the rest of the week. At Evernote, some teams try to stick to a “No-Meeting Wednesday” policy to facilitate deep work. 2. Consult the dictionary Meetings have taken on new definitions: check-ins, brainstorming sessions, or project status updates, to name a few. And this definition changes from team to team, and company to company. Redefine what meetings look like for your organization and reserve them solely for that purpose. For example, questions can be answered and problems can be solved in a less formal setting. Instead of blocking 30-minute meetings by default, try a 10-minute huddle at your coworker’s desk. If the issue still isn’t resolved, then a meeting may be required. This doesn’t mean you need to avoid brainstorming sessions or check-ins entirely; it just means that those may take on a new form, like syncing up over coffee. 3. Set the stage and make a strong exit People can get so caught up on the core purpose of a meeting that we forget about the other major parts: the beginning and end. While these parts may seem more like housekeeping tasks, they can dramatically affect the productivity of your meeting. First, every meeting should have an agenda (this is where Evernote templates are your friend). At a minimum, your agenda should list the meeting objective, meeting topics, and time allotted for each topic. Then, make sure someone takes notes during the meeting and shares them afterward so you can determine next steps. Before you wrap up, spend five minutes talking about action items, owners, and the timeframe to complete each one. 4. Strategically hit the “invite” button Ah, the guest list. Invite too many people to your meeting, and the conversation goes sideways. Invite too few people, and you won’t have all the necessary stakeholders to make a decision. Luckily, there are magic attendee numbers for certain types of meetings. Consider these tips next time you schedule one: To solve a problem, invite four to six people To make a decision, invite four to seven people To set an agenda, invite five to 15 people To brainstorm, invite 10 to 20 people Or you could follow Jeff Bezos’s famous “ two pizza rule ” — if the group is larger than you could feed with two pizzas, your meeting is too large, period. The main thing is to invite only those people who truly need to be there: those who have something to contribute, can get something out of it, or are directly affected by the outcome. 5. Keep laptops closed and ears open Meetings have become a time to check emails, catch up with Twitter on the sly, or wrap up a project. Oh yeah, and half-listen to what is actually happening in the meeting. No one can truly multitask (as much as we may tell ourselves differently), so consider banning open laptops in meetings except for presenters and notetakers. The lack of distraction will help you move through your agenda faster and reduce the need for follow-up meetings. Take notes by hand (how old fashioned!) or hold walking meetings to keep the focus on your conversation, not your devices. Walking meetings can also boost your creativity, energy, and happiness . Pro tip : Use the Evernote camera to snap a photo of your handwritten meeting notes, share them with colleagues, and store them in a safe place. 6. Chart the right path It’s hard enough to get everyone in the same room to pay attention and contribute. And when you have remote colleagues across different continents? Anyone who has joined a 15-person conference call knows that virtual meetings can quickly go off the rails. While in-person meetings are not always possible with distributed teams, you can mimic the same kind of engagement and productivity with a communication charter . This charter allows you to lay down the ground rules for how your team will communicate . You may include standards for things like meeting etiquette, where everyone agrees to limiting background noise and side conversations, talking at a reasonable pace, or not dominating the conversation. The charter can also help clarify when you should use certain kinds of communication channels. For example, your team may first default to calling, then chatting, and finally, emailing as a last resort. When your team has agreed on the guidelines, everyone signs the charter, which is then printed out and posted. Remember – You hold the keys to your calendar We are constantly looking for ways to make meetings more bearable. We try to rebrand them, calling them check-ins or stand-ups. We serve lunch to make them more appetizing. We add animation to PowerPoint presentations to engage our colleagues. But, regardless of the name, menu, or slide transition, meetings will always be painful unless we change the role they play in our working days. If it feels like having meetings is your entire job, it’s time to turn the tables and make meetings work for you. The real way to finally have better meetings? Stop making them your default. Avoid blindly accepting each and every invite, and remember that you can control how a meeting unfolds. And, if all else fails, just hit the decline button and do something more productive with your time. Like actually getting stuff done. *All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc.

Visit our template gallery to browse pre-made templates you can add to your Evernote account. Learn more » One of the advantages of Evernote is flexibility. When you get a brand new account, it comes as an empty vessel to fill up with your ideas. That being said, sometimes a blank slate can be a puzzling blocker, rather than an inspirational challenge. What exactly should you be filling it with? Alternatively, if you already know how to use Evernote, you may notice yourself capturing similar types of information or tackling the same tasks repeatedly, whether it’s taking meeting notes or making packing lists. How can you simplify everyday tasks? Thankfully, a good template solves both of these dilemmas. You may have heard whispers about the magic of templates in Evernote, but to many, templates are one of the hidden secrets of power users. After an overwhelmingly positive response to a free set of business templates for entrepreneurs we recently shared with you, we realized we needed to take things even further. In order to fully demystify templates, here’s  a definitive guide on what they are and how to use them, rounding up our favorites so you can take your productivity to the next level. The skinny on templates Templates can provide inspiration by showing what’s possible in Evernote, and can help  you streamline processes you repeat often. The beauty of templates is that they allow you to use your powerful brain and precious time for things other than set-up and formatting. How to use templates: copy, rinse, repeat When you come across a template you love, click on the link to open and preview the template. Then click Save to Evernote to easily add the template as a note to your Evernote account. Create a notebook just for templates to make things easier, saving all the ones you might need in there. Pro tip: Add your templates notebook to your shortcuts in the sidebar so you can get to it quickly. When it’s time to use a particular template, simply right-click (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Mac) and choose ‘Copy to Notebook’ from the pop-up menu. Save a copy of the template in the notebook of your choice. Then you can rename the template and get to work, leaving the original in your templates notebook so you can reuse it later. If you’d prefer to use templates custom-built for your needs, the good news is that making templates is easy. Just create a new note within your templates notebook and give it a title, such as ‘Template – Meeting Notes.’ Then, add anything from checklists to tables to give your template some structure. When your new template is ready to go, create a copy of it. This way, you preserve your original template note to use again. To learn even more about building a library of templates that you can use, reuse, and share, check out this how-to. Evernote Certified Consultants also have some great videos to walk you through the process, such as this one from template master Barbara Fuller of Simplify Days .

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Stacey Harmon: “Why Michael Hyatt is Wrong about Organizing Evernote with Tags”", "author": ["Stacey Harmon"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/stacey-harmon-michael-hyatt-wrong-organizing-evernote-tags/", "abstract": "If you’ve been following Evernote’s blog and Medium publication for any length of time, you know that we don’t prescribe a “best” way to organize your notes. Part of Evernote’s strength lies in its flexibility—offering you multiple techniques for keeping your life on track. Over the years a lively debate has sprung up between advocates of notebook-based organization and fans of tagging individual notes. We’ve often shared the viewpoint of Michael Hyatt , an outspoken proponent of tags. Now, Evernote Certified Consultant Stacey Harmon makes the case for notebooks. Who’s right? That, dear reader, is up to you. In my years as an Evernote consultant, it has been many times that I’ve seen Michael Hyatt’s blog post, How I Organize Evernote , linked to online and discussed on social media as the de-facto solution for how to organize Evernote. In his post, Michael goes into detail about how he organizes his Evernote account. He uses only four notebooks in his entire account, and the rest of his organization is based on a fairly complex system of tagging, so he can retrieve notes once he’s created them. The problem is… tags aren’t the only way to organize Evernote. Yet, the visibility and success of Michael Hyatt often makes it seem to many like tags are the “right” way to organize Evernote. Despite my admiration for Michael Hyatt (I’m a fan!), I disagree with his perspective on organizing Evernote. Tags are one way to organize Evernote, but for me, they aren’t the right way . The right way for me — as well as the vast majority of the people I have coached over my years as an Evernote consultant — is by using notebooks and stacks as the primary organizing blocks of Evernote, with tags being used not as an organizational tool, but a find feature in Evernote. In this post, I give my perspective on why using tags to organize your Evernote account isn’t practical, present some advice on what you should you do instead, and give some examples of how using tags might be useful in very specific circumstances. What’s Wrong with Using Tags to Organize Evernote? I believe there are several major disadvantages to using tags to organize your Evernote account. Tags Don’t Work the Same Way on All Devices – Which Makes Them Far Less Useful Tags display differently, depending on which device you’re on. If you’re on your desktop, you can nest tags on the desktop to provide some visual organization, but those nested tags won’t display in the Evernote app on your iPhone. Instead, on your mobile device, you’ll see an alphabetical list of all your tags, nullifying any advantage you have to the desktop organization of your tags. And, this will be a big hindrance for retrieving information from your mobile device via tags. I coach people that the Evernote mobile app is best used for capturing and retrieving information, not organizing it (this is best saved for the desktop app). So why would you organize your data in a way that isn’t supported on the mobile device? You are putting yourself at a disadvantage to find what you need, right out of the gate. If You Fail to Tag a Note, Your Whole Organizational System Fails If you’re using tags as the sole organizational system for your Evernote account, it’s incredibly easy to mess up and forget to add a tag (or a few tags, if you’re using a complex tagging system). That means one small error could cause trouble. One of the biggest fears of new Evernote users is that their notes will “get lost” – meaning their notes will fall through the cracks and become unfindable. Given that fear, why would you create an Evernote organizational system that’s so fragile? Relying on notebooks to organize your notes makes your system considerably more hardy and less susceptible to failure when you make tiny mistakes (which you inevitably will). It’s Too Easy to Create New Tags Productivity teacher Tiago Forte addressed this problem beautifully in a 2015 post he wrote on why tagging is broken (and with which my perspective very closely aligns). He says: “In Evernote and most tagging systems, all it takes to create a new tag is to type one. If the tag is not recognized as already existing, it is created. Thus the most problematic behavior is implicitly encouraged and enabled. Grrrrrrr. It could be a misspelling. It could be a slip of the finger. It could be a different capitalization, punctuation, or tense, whatever. No warning or indication is given, and a divergent tag is created, for you to hopefully notice and fix later, hopefully before you rely on it.” For example, you could create these four tags inadvertently: You may never notice this mistake, and years later you’ll be looking for particular piece of information and you won’t be able to find it because you accidentally tagged it as “reciept” instead of “Receipt.” Because you can create tags so easily, it’s easy for your list of tags to get completely out of hand. Yes, you can create 100,000 tags – but do you really want to? A tag-based system of organizing your organization simply isn’t scalable once you start putting your entire life into Evernote (as I have). You Need a Perfect Memory to Properly Utilize a Tag-Based System This is another point that Tiago eloquently made in his post that I totally agree with: Humans suffer from memory fatigue. Using a tag-based system relies completely on our own memorization skills — and as humans, we need to be realistic about the amount of information we can actually hold in our brains. As David Allen says: “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” When you use tags to organize your Evernote account, you need to remember every single tag you’ve ever used, including how each tag is punctuated and spelled. This may not seem daunting when you’re at the beginning of your Evernote journey, and you’ve only created 10 tags, but after you’ve used Evernote for years, your tag list may grow into the thousands. Can you remember that many tags, and use them perfectly? No human can. You also can’t rely on Evernote’s autofill feature to jog your memory. The autofill feature doesn’t work on all devices, so if you’re using autofill on your phone, you’re out of luck. Tags Don’t Work When You’re Sharing and Collaborating in Evernote A tag-based organization in Evernote can completely fall apart when you start collaborating and sharing your information with collaborators. You can’t share a group of notes with someone that is based on tags. If I wanted to share a group of notes tagged “Social Media” with my assistant, it wouldn’t be possible. You can share a notebook with others. You can share a note or several notes with others. But you can’t share a group of notes that all share the same tag. This is a point that I haven’t seen in previous discussions about Evernote organization, and it’s a major disadvantage to organizing by tags. Most people use Evernote for their own personal organization, but they don’t share their notes and notebooks with friends, family members, and colleagues – and that’s a huge missed opportunity. It’s one of the major ways people underutilize Evernote. There’s another problem with collaboration and tags: When you share a notebook with others, your tags will appear in that person’s account. See the example below. This is not my tag (“Stacey Harmon Sales Page – Radical Productivity with Evernote”), but this note is in one of my shared notebooks, so the tag appears in my account because one of my collaborators created it. Sharing and collaborating is one of the biggest reasons I love using Evernote, so for me, these problems are one of the most compelling arguments for not using a tag-based system. What You Should Do Instead of Using Tags to Organize Your Evernote Account Here’s my organizational system in Evernote, in a nutshell: I use notebooks and stacks to organize my information and provide visual structure to my account. Stacks are key to keeping my notebook structure visually clutter free, collapsing my nearly 250 notebooks down to 8 tidy stacks. I have my notebook/stack list displayed on the left hand sidebar on the desktop app to act as a visual roadmap to my data. I drag key notes, notebooks, and searches to the shortcuts area of Evernote for quick access to my most frequently accessed data. I often prep my notes so I can find them later in search. That means I work to give each note a meaningful title, and add searchable keywords to the body of the note if necessary. Here are the biggest advantages of using this process to organize your information in Evernote: Advantage #1: You can use the search function to find anything, and it’s nearly instant. When you stop relying on tags, you’ll start using the search function to find what you need. This is exactly what I do, and I can find whatever I seek in Evernote in just a few seconds….even with 26,000+ notes in my account. There are many ways to search in Evernote. You simply need to know how to search correctly, and become a bit more fluent in search techniques, and you’ll be able to retrieve anything. If a word or phrase is somewhere in Evernote (including in note titles, notebook titles, the text of the note, in your images and documents within a note, or in your handwriting on a scanned note) Evernote search will be able to find it for you. Even Michael Hyatt acknowledges the power of Evernote search when he’s talking about using tags. He says: “It is tempting to tag every note with a several tags. However, I broke myself of that habit once I realized that Evernote indexes every word in every note. So if you have a great quote on “purpose,” for example, you don’t need to tag the note with “purpose,” so long as the word appears in the note. This only adds more clutter. The key is to remember that less is more.” Advantage #2: A notebook-based organizational system makes things easier and faster to find. When you organize your account with notebooks and stacks, you’ll have natural groupings to your data, most of which your brain will remember (just like when you had lots of manilla folders and you knew that the meeting notes were in a particular project folder). And, your brain can often instantly see the notebook you are looking for when scanning your notebook list on the left-hand sidebar, or typing a few characters in the notebook search field from your mobile device. This provides you the option to go right to your data as your brain knows which notebook holds what you are looking for. A notebook based approach also benefits you when you navigate Evernote using advanced functions such as “ Jump to ” which bring up a note and notebook list that can be filtered with a few keystrokes, and more often than not, brings you directly to the exact note you are seeking. And, should either of these approaches fail you, the full power of Evernote search will uncover what you seek. Because search is so powerful, it is possible to simply create a system of notebooks and stacks that makes sense for your workflow, start adding notes, and rely on the search function to retrieve information. Advantage #3: Using notebooks works the same everywhere, on every device. No matter what device you’re using to access Evernote, your notes, notebooks, and stacks will display in the same organization as you see on other devices. There’s no need to worry about not being able to find something when you switch from your phone to your laptop, or vice versa. Objections to a Notebook-Based Organizational Approach Michael Hyatt brought up a few problems associated with using notebooks in Evernote, and these are the main objections I hear from people who are currently using a tag-based system. Let’s address them, one at a time. Objection #1: “Notebooks are limited to 250 per personal account. I need more!” The constraint of 250 notebooks for non-business accounts is true, but you can absolutely make 250 notebooks work for you – if you actively manage the notebooks you use. That means you’ll need to regularly review your account, and collapse (or consolidate) notebooks you’re no longer actively using. If you absolutely must have more notebooks, you can upgrade your Evernote subscription – you can have 5,000 notebooks with a Business account – but this isn’t essential or my recommended advice. Smaller constraints are actually better, and with fewer notebooks, you’ll be able to work more efficiently and will have a stop-gap in place to avoid any challenges associated with digital bloat. Objection #2: “Notebooks can be stacked, but not nested. I need more organizational levels.” We’ve all been trained (through email, and computer technology) that the right way to organize things is to use hierarchies that are many levels deep – but it’s not necessarily the best way. If you’re using the search function correctly, it doesn’t matter if you can nest your notes and notebooks. The power of my Evernote organization system is its flatness and flexibility. If you prep your notes for search success (note naming conventions are key here), it doesn’t matter where your notes live – you’ll be able to locate them. Objection #3: “A note can only exist in one notebook at a time. What if it fits into two different categories?” This objection is really best addressed by creating a proper workflow that meets your needs for how you want to interact with your information, rather than addressing how the data is organized in Evernote. As stated, I advocate organizing the data in notebooks and stacks. If you’re prepping your notes for search success and you’re fluent in Evernote search, you can find anything you need at any time. It doesn’t matter that a note only exists in one notebook. When your workflow is clear, you can then deploy more advanced Evernote features such as note links (hyperlinks from one note to another) to create structure within your account and easily reference notes that are related, but live in other notebooks. Tags Can Be Useful Under Specific Circumstances I want to make it clear that I’m not anti-tags. I just think they are best used in workflow design vs. as the foundation of your Evernote organizational system. For most people, they should be used as a tool for finding things, rather than a tool for organizing your information. Tags can be useful as a find feature, so I recommend treating them like the icing on the cake when you’re setting up your Evernote account (instead of using them like the entire cake, as many people do). For example, here are some good use cases for tags: Collapsing or archiving notebooks. If you’re regularly managing your notebooks (see above), you can use tags to convert your Notebooks to tags when you’re no longer using them. Simply tag all the data in that Notebook, and put it into an Archive notebook. Pulling “dashboard” data from across multiple notebooks. For example, you could have a note in each client notebook called “Progress Report for ” and this note could be tagged as “Weekly Meeting”. This would allow you to pull all the progress reports from across your entire Evernote account if you wanted to review the status of all your client projects during a regular weekly meeting. Tracking status. Tags are best used when there is a limited number of set items to track. For example, movement of something from Active, to Pending, to Completed. Creating a static set of tags to represent the process and then updating the tag as the note moves through the process is an good use case for tags. Using third-party applications. Evernote integrates beautifully with thousands of third-party platforms, and many of those applications use tagging as part of their integrations. For example, TaskClone uses tags to share tasks from Evernote directly into their app. Using Notebooks to Make Your Evernote Experience Faster, Easier, and More Efficient Tags can be an important tool in the Evernote world, but overall I think basing your Evernote organization on a structured system of notebooks and stacks is an easier and more efficient way of being able to pull up any note you need, from any device, at any time. If you are interested in exactly how I organize my Evernote account using notebooks and stacks (not tags!), check out my EverDone® Guide . In it, I detail out my personal system for using notes, notebooks, and stacks to deploy David Allen’s Getting Things Done productivity philosophy in Evernote.

Sharing should be effortless Note and notebook sharing should feel more natural, the way you would expect it to be. If you haven’t noticed, we share things all the time. We share photos of food. We share links to cat videos. Now, when you save those things to Evernote, you’ll be able to share them more easily. Did you pull a great quote off of a blog post or think of a new way to grow your business? Once you’ve saved these to Evernote, easily share them as a link in an email, a text, or a Slack message directly from Evernote, all without opening your messaging apps. The best thing about it is that you can share notes with anyone, even if they don’t use Evernote. Learn more » Easily find what’s been shared with you Once your friends, family, and co-workers get into the habit of sharing notes with you, you’ll want an easy way to keep track of everything that’s been shared. We’ve designed a new ‘Shared’ section which lists all the notes and notebooks that have been shared with you. Quickly find what you’re looking for by: Filtering the list by name or type (note or notebook) Sorting the list by title, name, and date Learn more » Share notebooks and save time If you’re working with others on a project or planning a family trip, you may find yourself sharing more notes than you normally do. Save time by placing all your project briefs, travel itineraries, and planning notes in a notebook, then sharing it with others. Instead of sending email attachments every time you want to share notes, simply send out a quick message reminding your group to check the shared notebook for new and updated notes. This shared notebook isn’t just another shared folder sitting in the cloud. It’s more like a digital journal with pages you can attach files to and add notes and comments to. Move beyond simple note-taking and file sharing by attaching any type of file to a note, then add relevant comments, tasks lists, or annotations. Examples: Use Microsoft Excel to track your family finances, then attach it to a note, with a bullet-point list of upcoming purchase and travel plans. Annotate PDFs of sales materials in Evernote, then attach them to a note, alongside similar documents you share with customers or clients. Invite others in the group to contribute. Once they receive an email invite, participants will need to sign in to (or sign up for) Evernote to join the notebook. Once they’ve joined, they’re free to add images, audio recordings, web articles, and any other thoughts and ideas to it. Anyone with access can re-share individual notes from the  notebook with clients, vendors, or potential leads. Learn more » TIP : If everyone in your group (or team) uses Evernote, a shared notebook can become a resource hub or an information library. Documents in the shared notebook can be created or saved outside of Evernote, then attached to or linked from a note.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Introducing Evernote for Microsoft Teams", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/introducing-evernote-microsoft-teams/", "abstract": "Over the years, Evernote has made teamwork easier by building integrations with a host of powerful apps, including Microsoft Outlook, Salesforce , Google Drive, Gmail , Slack , and many others. Today we’re pleased to add another big name to that list. Introducing Evernote for Microsoft Teams Microsoft Teams is the communication hub for productive companies, where teams can chat, share messages, and move projects forward. As part of the Office 365 suite, it enables colleagues to share emails, documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, and manage the flow of information. Our latest integration brings Evernote into the context of your conversations in Teams so you can easily reference specific notes within a conversation, and access notes without having to leave the Teams experience. With Evernote for Microsoft Teams , you can seamlessly share, pin, edit, and search your Evernote content—right from the Microsoft Teams app. This helps you work without interruption and keeps everyone on the same page. We sat down with Mansoor Malik, Principal Product Manager for Microsoft Teams, and Leo Gong, Senior Product Manager at Evernote, to get their thoughts on this new integration. We asked them why the partnership between Evernote and Microsoft is so exciting, and what it means for customers and the future of teamwork. Q: What does integrating with Evernote bring to the Microsoft Teams product, and how will users benefit? Mansoor Malik (Microsoft): Microsoft Teams democratizes information. It makes it available, brings transparency to it, and ensures everyone has access to it. With this integration, users can now access their Evernote content and share it with the whole team—in one place, and in the same channel. You don’t have to remember a URL or switch back and forth between Teams and Evernote. It’s all right there. Leo Gong (Evernote): For a lot of our customers, Evernote is their second brain. It’s where they collect all their information and the ideas they’re working on. Combining these two places allows them to easily tap into that knowledge hub and share it with everyone. Let’s say you’re trying to plan logistics around a product launch in Microsoft Teams. Being able to access Evernote allows you to keep a record of what people are agreeing upon, and what the current plan is—in parallel to the conversation. Q: What is the problem that this solves for users? MM : You may have to-dos that you want to add in Evernote, and you may want to start talking about them. You can either share a snippet of it in Teams and start a conversation that way, or you can pin it as a tab and have the conversation around that tab. What’s cool is that the conversation you have, in context with the note that’s pinned, happens right there. It can also be persistent so it stays within the chat. So anyone from the team can either jump into that conversation in real time or, if they come in later, reply to it in the same thread, with the same context. LG: Many people use Evernote as a repository for their business’s information. This integration helps them very easily share that information whenever they’re asked. Also, the same questions often get asked again and again. The Pinned tab allows you to pin a note in the channel with answers to all those frequently asked questions, so it’s easily accessible for others. Finally, there can often be 10 to 20 different messages that you need to consider when you’re making a decision. It gets unmanageable very quickly. So it’s good to have a tab, one place to keep a list of “What’s the decision we just made, and what are the next steps?” Q. What do you think people struggle with the most when it comes to sharing information within a team setting? MM: Before, if you wanted to share something, you’d have to open up your email and attach a Word document or a file, and send it to somebody—even your colleague who’s sitting in the next office. Then you’d have to wait for their reply, then revise it, and so on. This integration means that those conversations, those decisions, can be documented, edited, and captured in real time, so you don’t have to wait for the back and forth. LG: I think it’s the friction around sharing information. Even beyond this initial launch, we’re interested in making that easier. How can we automate the sharing of information? That’s something we think about. Q: In your experience, how have workflows evolved over time? Do you find that people are asking for integrations with their favorite tools often? MM: Employees today are on twice as many teams as they were five years ago. The amount of time that employees spend engaging in collaborative work—in meetings, on phone calls, or answering emails—has increased about 50 percent. It takes up to 80 percent more of employees’ time. Notwithstanding that, productivity experiences are getting fragmented over time, leading to reduced productivity, change fatigue, and reduced employee sentiment and morale. This integration tries to reunify the experience to address these issues. LG: Workplaces are evolving to include more specialized tools, so more than ever we see a lot of different teams, and a lot of individuals, wanting and expecting choice at work. Even with note editing, which is a relatively simple use case, there are so many tools out there and each of them has different strengths. Integrations allow customers to use the tools that will make them effective, because they’re able to bring their own tools into their collaborative work. Evernote integrates with all types of documents and helps people share notes very easily, so that they can choose the tools they need to make them effective. With Microsoft Teams, you don’t have to use a specific database or a specific task management tool. Teams becomes the glue that helps you and your team work together—even if they’re on different systems. Q: When integrating with another product, is there a typical checklist you go through? What makes this partnership a good fit? MM: We look at how we can add value to our mutual customers. Specifically, we look at common teamwork productivity scenarios and ways to make it easier for people to get their job done, to make their experience more valuable, and enhance it so that they feel like it’s easy. Evernote is a great fit for Teams because people are already working together in teams. Having Evernote integrated there just makes sense, to help them get their job done faster. The other thing we look at is shared vision with our partners around the digital and cultural transformation that’s happening in the modern workplace. We certainly have to snap to that. LG: It’s the same for us. The top bar that we need to clear is: is there a natural fit in the users’ workflows? Does this measurably make their lives better? And second, what do we have to offer Microsoft? How does this make Evernote users more successful as well? And lastly, it’s a feasibility consideration, which is: Can we build it and how quickly? Q: From a strategic product perspective, how do you keep up with the needs of an increasingly demanding customer? MM: We’re always listening to our customer feedback, whether it’s on Twitter, UserVoice, or within our end product feedback tool. We also look at the way people are working and features they’re asking for, whether it’s apps for mobile, or even desktop. We’re also trying to envision what the future of work will look like on a longer-term horizon. As the workforce changes, as Millennials get on board, they definitely have new demands. We look into that, we prioritize it, and we put it in the backlog. Whatever is most asked for gets done first, and we go down the stack from there. LG: One, it’s having an ear to the ground. We spend a lot of time talking to our customers, and often we’ll see opportunities for improvement. Two, is doing pretty extensive testing with features that we want to launch, and making sure that we’re doing it in a way that’s actually helpful to our users. You don’t want to necessarily implement exactly what the customer is requesting because often it’s a symptom of a greater or undiscovered need. So we think about what they’re really trying to say, and what they’re really struggling with. Q: I imagine that can be hard at times, like doing a bit of detective work. LG: Exactly. MM: Yep, totally agree. Q: There has been a shift from having competitors to the idea of “playing well with others.” What is your view on adopting this approach from the technology standpoint? MM: We’re building a product for collaboration, so we have to be collaborative. By working and playing with others, we help our customers and users get the most value. And in this particular case, it really helps increase their productivity, and users love it. So if we can increase productivity, if we can keep the user engaged, even if it’s working with a competitor or a partner, so be it. That’s why we are open and willing to let people use the tools they want to use. Because we believe that tools and technology facilitate productivity and enable customers to get more done faster. LG: Playing well with others has always been a core value for Evernote. We help you capture your thoughts and information—wherever it comes from. As to how we adopt it from a technology standpoint, it means building our product in a modular way so we’re not just supporting a single document type. We’re architecting the app in a way where it can accept any document type as a module, so you can plug-and-play additional ones in the future. It’s a win-win because building a product in a way that supports integrations speeds up your own development. Your developers will thank you because when they’re trying to extend functionality into the product in the future, they will also benefit. Q: Advancements in technology have made it possible for people to work anywhere, from any device. How can we keep up with the demands of such a highly connected workforce? MM: Every team is different. Every individual is different, and they have their unique preferences and needs. As a platform, Microsoft Teams enables people to bring anything they want in terms of the apps and services they use the most. By doing so they can customize Microsoft Teams to fit their needs better for their increased productivity. By allowing these types of integrations, by working well with other partners and competitors, we’re meeting the demands of a highly connected workforce. At the same time, we’re making sure, as Evernote is, that we’re cross-platform, cross-device, multi-screen. We want to make sure that wherever you are, however you’re connected, you can get your work done. LG: In a way, the causation is a little fuzzy because having integrations enables you to work from anywhere and from any device. At the same time, integrations help you live better in a world like that. I think where Microsoft Teams is really helpful is that it provides a hub for you to manage a lot of complexity. Because if everybody’s using 20 different apps, it becomes very difficult to manage. But if there’s some way for you to start centralizing your communications, with all of your sharing in one place, it helps people manage the overload of information. Q: What do you see changing in the next five years with regard to the way people are working? And how are you looking to solve that with new product features and/or updates? MM: Everybody is looking to get stuff done faster. What we are thinking, with these integrations, is how we can use machine learning or AI to help them do that. For example, imagine you’re making a note that you need to send marketing materials for review and approval. It’d be cool if, as you’re typing or talking about it, an AI bot senses that this is actually a task that needs to be created and assigned to somebody, and then followed up on. Those are ways that we can improve productivity by doing things for people on their behalf. Call recording, transcription, and translation is also something that we are looking into. All this stuff can get done automatically. LG: I see there being two related trends. One is that there’s a rapid acceleration of the amount of information that people are consuming. Number two is that technology has gotten to a point where it’s actually possible to help users manage that overflow of information, so we’re at a really interesting time. The first thing that will really help people is better aggregation and integrations. I see Evernote being the place that helps you manage your information by integrating with the tools you use to create information, and collecting all of that in one central hub. The second piece of technology is, as Mansoor mentioned, AI and machine learning. The interesting thing that we’ll be able to do in the next five years is apply machine learning to help users make sense of information that they’re getting. Because it’s really important to be able to sift through it all and figure out what’s important. The analogy I love to give is: If I walk into your kitchen, it might be really tidy, but I don’t know where anything is kept. Machine learning allows us to surface your items in your kitchen, in a context that makes sense with regard to how I organize and how I think.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "CEO Notebook: Say Hello to a Refreshed Evernote", "author": ["Chris O'Neill"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/ceo-notebook-evernote-brand/", "abstract": "In June, we celebrated an important milestone in our history, our 10th anniversary. Today is another pivotal moment: we are pulling back the curtain on an evolved Evernote mission and a refreshed brand. As CEO of Evernote, I have had the privilege of overseeing a company and set of products that improve people’s lives and work. Every day, we hear from customers and community members who tell us how Evernote is changing their worlds, in big ways and small. These stories tell us that Evernote is a part of something bigger than itself, and that’s what motivates us to build the best company we can. Our new brand reflects the optimism, clarity, and confidence that Evernote instills in our customers, and that they, in turn, give back to us. We believe that people should spend more time on the things that matter most to them. This means we’re modernizing the way we design and build our products. We are working to improve the customer experience. And we’re finding new ways that Evernote can play an essential role in people’s lives. That role has changed dramatically over the past ten years, and we want our brand to reflect the ways we’ve grown. Remembering everything is as important today as it has ever been, but Evernote is about more than that. We help people manage information overload and find their focus. We are now more clear about that purpose and will be intentional about incorporating it into everything we do. At the beginning of the year I said that we would concentrate on three areas— Engage , Extend , and Explore . Here’s what those words mean for our company and our new brand: Engage with what matters Evernote has been an ingredient in the success of our community and customers, and we are dedicated to aiding that success. We aspire to help you work smarter, not harder, to make progress on your goals. To do this, we are constantly improving the core product and we’re selective about which companies we choose to partner with. From enhanced integrations with Apple, Slack , Salesforce , and Microsoft , to polishing up the look and feel of our apps, we’ve made it easier to focus on your thoughts without interrupting your flow. We’ve also worked this year to improve the functionality of our products, specifically around how people are searching, collecting, and sharing information. Extend impact When you have the ability to focus on what is most important to you, something magical happens. You become more productive, more balanced, and even happier. Ideas spark actions. And when those ideas are shared, opportunity grows to impact other individuals, teams, and entire communities. The problems that Evernote addresses cross borders, time zones, and languages, impacting millions of lives every day. We’re tackling the challenges of sharing and collaboration directly in our product development. As today’s workplaces and organizations continue to evolve, effective collaboration is the key to success . So we recently launched a new collaboration feature in Evernote Business called Spaces , which improves the way teams organize and share information. But Spaces is just the beginning of a larger initiative. Evernote’s goal is to enable people to seamlessly share information, see the big picture, and keep everyone on the same page, so they can focus on doing their best work. Explore what’s possible When people have a safe space to create, find, and share information they can be confident in their capacity to thrive. Determination and the self-assurance to explore what’s possible are at the root of what Evernote is all about. It’s about giving people the freedom to focus, which also means not getting in the way. We don’t dictate how to use our products or how you should organize. Evernote lets you use the tools and methods that work for you. We believe that people can accomplish the most when they are free to be who they are and work the way they want to. Integrating with other tools is the best way we know to allow people to work they way they want. But you will also see this principle at the heart of many of the product enhancements we plan to announce over the next twelve months. Stay tuned. Our purpose is simple: we’re here to help people focus on what matters most. That idea underlies all of our work here at Evernote, and we will never stop striving to deliver on its promise. Throughout the process of evolving our brand, we have looked to our past for inspiration for our future. We started as a place to remember everything, and that will never go away. But bringing ideas to action and helping people to work together have become equally important to our customers, and therefore equally important in the products and experiences we build. Our brand now reflects our broader purpose and is a public declaration of our excitement and optimism for Evernote’s future.

Every day, Evernote customers create millions of notes that contain links pasted from Google Drive, and they asked for a better way to connect the ideas they keep in Evernote with actions they take in Google Drive. Today, we’re proud to announce that Evernote and Google Drive now work better together, making it easier than ever to capture, organize, and collaborate on whatever is on your mind. Google Drive and Evernote: A natural pairing More than half of all Evernote users also have a Google Account. Now, everyone using Google Drive can access their Drive files in Evernote. Get ready for a rich, intuitive experience where your ideas can flow. There’s no more switching between apps, so your thinking isn’t interrupted. How does it work? All the files you keep in Drive are now easier to access in Evernote. Now, instead of seeing only URL links, anyone can browse anything created or stored in Google Drive right in Evernote notebooks. With this integration, Evernote customers can add any file in Drive to their notes without leaving Evernote. And any changes to files in Google Drive will dynamically update in Evernote. “Making Drive content available in Evernote was very natural for us,” said Alex Vogenthaler, Group Product Manager for Google Drive. “Evernote is a great productivity tool and we want anyone using Drive to have access to their content whenever and wherever they’re trying to get stuff done. That’s the cloud at its best.” This integration opens the door for millions of Google Drive customers to experience the power of Evernote. Use Google Drive to store your ideas, memories, and work. Then, take advantage of Evernote’s powerful organizational features to make sense of them all and inspire new ideas. “Once people see how well Evernote and Google Drive work together, they’ll use both products intuitively,” says Evernote CEO Chris O’Neill. “For Evernote enthusiasts, this is a natural progression. Google is organizing the world’s information, and now Google Drive and Evernote are helping you do just that with your information.” Coming soon to a device near you This new relationship paves the way for greater collaboration between Evernote and Google, and this is just the beginning. Today, this beta integration is available for the web on Chrome, and for Android. Other platforms will follow soon.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Introducing Spaces in Evernote Business: Collaboration Made Easier", "author": ["Erik Wrobel"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/spaces-evernote-business/", "abstract": "Today, information is increasing in both velocity and volume.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Why Deep Work Matters in a Distracted World", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/why-deep-work-matters-in-a-distracted-world/", "abstract": "From the moment we wake in the morning, we’re tempted. Reach for the phone. Check texts. Read email. Scroll through social feeds. Add a few clicks to news stories and before long, you’ve logged what will likely be the first of more than 76 daily interactions with your mobile device. Even though mobile devices have increased our access to information and ability to communicate with others, they’ve also introduced barriers that could negatively impact our work. By understanding how to distance ourselves from distractions and improve time management, we have a better chance to dive deeper into our thinking and reach new heights of productivity. Battle for our attention Today, we are engaged in a battle for attention—from a cascading waterfall of social streams, news articles, chatter, and digital noise. We unlock our iPhones an average of 80 times and rack up more than 4.7 hours actively engaged with our mobile device each day. Thirty percent of our daily media consumption is spent surfing the internet. It’s not just social noise, either. The average American watches 35 hours of television a week, and our viewing habits have taken a dramatic tilt from televisions to devices. In the ultimate sign that change is afoot in response to our shifting spans of focus, the National Basketball League (NBA), a stalwart of the American sports scene, is exploring ways to speed up the end of games to satisfy shrinking attention spans. According to a recent survey commissioned by Microsoft, we lose our focus faster than a goldfish . The glaring takeaway was a quote in the report by Microsoft chief Satya Nadella, who signaled the trait most essential to modern employees seeking success: “The true scarce commodity of the future will be human attention.” Deeper connection to our work The idea of ‘deep work’ is nothing new. The term was recently coined by Cal Newport, a professor, scientist, and author of “ Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World .” According to Newport, deep work is classified as ‘professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limits.’ It’s been practiced in some ways or another by everyone from Carl Jung to United States President Barack Obama. President Obama, a well-known ‘night guy,’ logged time deep into the evening from his office, reading, writing speeches, preparing memos, examining documents, and thinking. He’d be able to finish things during the late night hours that drew constant focus from the leader of the free world during the day. “Everybody carves out their time to get their thoughts together. There is no doubt that window is his window,” said Rahm Emanuel , Mr. Obama’s first chief of staff. “You can’t block out a half-hour and try to do it during the day. It’s too much incoming. That’s the place where it can all be put aside and you can focus.” Carl Jung was so passionate about decoupling from the trappings of the world, he built a stone complex in Switzerland he could retreat to when he needed to reflect, think, and write. In his memoir, Jung credited the escape as being important to helping him be satisfied, sufficient, and restful. These two examples seem almost contradictory. In fact, they are classic illustrations of escaping to a place of comfort as a way to get stuff done. If deep work is a vehicle for concentration and thinking that produces work, it can happen in the Oval Office or in the mountains of Switzerland. It’s the ritual, scheduling, and location of the work that matter. FOMO Newport examined the cognitive impact that social media and office distractions have, and the importance of undivided attention in completing meaningful work. By removing distractions, he argues, we can move beyond “shallow work” to reach new levels of productivity and produce a substantial amount of work. Of course, social media is not bad, and we’d be silly to suggest otherwise. Most of us have an irrational fear of missing out , (FOMO)—so we’ve become dependent on social media, groomed to always check in. But, if we understand that distraction can negatively impact our deep work, then we can start to take steps to help us focus on complicated cognitive functions. What do we get out of that? We’re rewarded with mastery of complicated tasks, better information processing, and producing more in less time. “We have a growing amount of research which tells us that if you spend large portions of your day in a state of fragmented attention—where your regular workflow is constantly broken up by taking frequent breaks to just check in with social media—that this can permanently reduce your capacity for concentration,” said Newport . Much of social media is specifically built to fragment your time. Not unlike a slot machine, it rewards you with “shiny things”—likes, hearts, retweets, comments, and other positivity in exchange for time . Before long, your day becomes disrupted as you push, pull, and swipe for updates and notifications. Even a quick glance at Twitter or reviewing an email has a negative impact on your ability to focus on tasks. In fact, that one quick glance costs you about 15 to 20 minutes of attention loss . Our brains are simply not wired for that level of distraction. The barrage of the social media world is changing the landscape of our brain’s reward centers . In addition to impacting our cognitive ability to get work done, it also concerns medical professionals, who are seeing increased rates of anxiety other psychological issues among college students . Distractions are a growing part of interruptions knowledge workers experience in the office on a daily basis. It’s not just self-imposed interruptions from social media. In the office, we’re bombarded with instant messages, chat and communications from colleagues using collaboration software, email notifications, co-worker “drive-bys,” last-minute meeting requests, and even distractions caused by open floorplans designed to bring us closer together . The New Economy A new competitive information economy is here. And Newport argues that it’s one that will reward workers who understand that the currency is work that produces ‘ unambiguously rare and valuable output . “Our work culture’s shift toward the shallow … is exposing a massive opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth…:” Newport writes in Deep Work . The rarest commodity of all is the employee who’s able to devote significant time to deep work and its byproduct — high-quality material that is incredibly difficult to automate or to replicate by a machine, an algorithm, or globalization. “Anything a six-year-old can do with a smartphone is not something the market will reward,” Newport says. Deep work is a tool you need to build and produce things like a craftsman. Think of the time it takes a glassblower to perfect a beautifully-sculpted vase, or how a master woodworker uses both art and craft to create furniture worthy of display in a museum. Computer programmers, visual designers, academics, and writers all have a huge competitive advantage because of this ability to concentrate and turn out that rare and valuable commodity—the craft that drives the information age. “If you can write an elegant algorithm, write a legal brief, write a thousand words of prose, look at a sea of unambiguous data—If you can do these types of activities to produce outcomes that are rare and valuable, people will find you—regardless of how many Instagram followers you have.” — Cal Newport How to create meaningful work Deep work does not have to be tedious. In fact, it can be enjoyable, creative, meditative, and thought-provoking. Here are some tactics to integrate the principles of deep work into your schedule: Work deeply. It takes great patience and practice to get to the point where you can integrate long stretches of deep work into your schedule. Newport created an equation to explain the intensity required of deep work and compared it to students who pulled all-nighters in college. Work accomplished = (time spent) x (intensity) Work at a high level with dynamic and intense intervals that increase over time to produce a desirable outcome. Get in the zone for at least 90 minutes and build up to periods that last anywhere from two to four hours, or more. Protect your time. Maintain a set of rituals and routines to ease deep work into your day more easily. Try implementing scheduling tactics into your workflow like: Tallies – Keep a tally of the hours you spend working, or when you reach important milestones like pages read or words written. Deep scheduling – Try scheduling deep work hours well in advance on a calendar, like two or four weeks ahead of time. Scheduling and tracking time has a huge benefit of giving time back. Many academics, authors, and scientists have been able to produce ample amount of work while working normal hours and having time for personal pursuits or family on evenings and weekends. Finding ways to increase efficiencies, for example spending less time searching for documents or easing collaboration with your team, can also help improve workflow . Train your brain to do nothing. Try for a moment, to sit still and do nothing. How long do you find it takes until the social stimuli and buzzing signals of your mobile device prove too much? If you can embrace sitting quietly meditating or thinking, or even staring into space, then you can train your brain to spend more time in deeper work. Quit swimming upstream. Decide for yourself what restrictions you can place on email and social media by removing it from your work week altogether, or by logging out and staying off for an entire day. Evaluate your personal and professional life and experiment where social fits and where it doesn’t. Your result may be a month-long digital detox, or completely cutting the cord on social. Cut the shallow work. Endless meeting requests and instant email responses are turning knowledge workers into ‘human routers’ that create the shallow work that defines many of workplaces. We’ve been groomed to reply and respond because it feels like we’re accomplishing something, when in reality, we’re not. “Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness,” Newport warns, “and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.” How are you diving deeper into your work and avoiding distractions?

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Why Journaling Is Good for Your Mental Health", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/why-journaling-is-good-for-your-mental-health/", "abstract": "When you were a teenager, maybe you kept a diary filled with your deepest thoughts, feelings, and fears. It’s easy to think of journaling as something that belongs to the past, but it doesn’t have to be that way. No matter your age, a journal is a safe space where you can express your thoughts and emotions, free from judgment or scrutiny. It can even help improve your mental health . The links between journaling and mental health If you struggle with anxiety, expressing yourself in writing can help you worry less about stressful ta s ks . Keeping a journal allows you to express overwhelming emotions and observe your thought patterns, rather than simply reacting to them. According to the University of Rochester Medical Center , the benefits of journaling include: Giving you a way to track causes of stress or symptoms associated with mental illness. You can recognize repeating triggers and find ways to reduce their impact on you. Helping you prioritize your problems, concerns, and fears. This can make it easier to figure out what is upsetting you most and focus your attention accordingly. Providing a space for you to work through negative thoughts and behaviors. Crucially, this is a place where you don’t have to worry about what others might think. If you’re new to journaling, the concept may seem daunting. Here are three tips to help you get started today. Choose a journaling method that works for you Most importantly, pick what feels right. If the traditional pen-and-paper method gets your ideas flowing, then use it. There are however two main advantages to using a note-taking app like Evernote. First, Evernote allows you to write whenever you feel inspired because it’s always with you. It lives on your phone, computer, or any other device, making it easier to write in your journal on a regular basis. Evernote can also help you gain more insights from your journal. Rather than reading your journal entries chronologically or opening to a page at random, you can use se a rch or tags to view your entries by keywords. This lets you see each time you mentioned a certain idea or feeling, which can help you identify patterns in your thoughts and experiences. Follow two best practices Write often, and write in your own style. Setting aside enough time to write on a daily basis can help you keep better track of your emotional state and how it changes or develops over time. It might be tough to stick with writing every day at first, but you’ll find it gets easier the more you do it. Also, your journal doesn’t need to abide by traditional rules, even when it comes to spelling and grammar. Write whatever needs to come out—however it needs to come out. Let your thoughts flow without evaluating them or worrying about how they’re written. You might find that taking liberties with language helps you articulate things that are otherwise hard to put into words. Combine journaling with other healthy choices While journaling can provide benefits for your mental health, the University of Rochester recommends you combine it with other aspects of a healthy lifestyle. In order to reduce your anxiety, stress, and any other mental health conditions, try to make time to relax or meditate every day. Exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet will also contribute to your overall well-being. Stay away from alcohol and drugs, and be sure you get enough sleep each night. A consistent journaling practice can reduce stress, boost your mood, and help you make better sense of your thoughts. Take a few minutes each day to write down whatever comes into your head—you’ll be better able to understand your emotions in a safe, healthy way.", "date": "2019-07-19,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Write Effective Meeting Minutes", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-to-write-effective-meeting-minutes/", "abstract": "Meetings can challenge our focus—to put it gently. That’s why meeting minutes are crucial. Good minutes help everyone remember what was said, track any decisions, and clarify action items. Without them, confusion can set in as everyone’s attention starts to wane. If taking meeting minutes is your responsibility, you’ve no doubt faced the eternal dilemma: Write too little and you risk missing a vital detail. Write too much and you saddle your colleagues with the unhappy task of separating what’s important from what’s totally irrelevant. Assuming you don’t want to willfully torture your co-workers, here are five strategies to help you capture the essentials and make your meeting minutes more effective. 1. Set an agenda Ever been in a meeting that strayed so far off topic you silently asked the universe, when will this end? We have too. Here’s where a good agenda comes in handy. According to Dr. Tabitha Hart at San Jose State University, agendas give structure to your meetings. This helps everyone focus on what matters so you don’t have to wade through as many irrelevant ideas while you’re taking minutes. To create your agenda, write down every step of your meeting and make sure each item is: Specific and realistic within the scope of the meeting Results-oriented and helps guide the discussion Assigned a reasonable amount of discussion time 2. Use a reliable note-taking app It isn’t always clear in the middle of a meeting how everyone’s ideas should be structured on the page. Writing down meeting minutes by hand makes it hard to re-organize them later. Using a reliable note-taking app like Evernote will make taking minutes much more efficient and ensure the meeting details are legible and easy to update. You’ll be able to record minutes quickly and share the information with co-workers, as well as search previous notes. 3. Include a few key components in all your meeting minutes Minutes should be clear at a glance, so anyone who reads them days or weeks later can quickly find what they need. To achieve this, include: The names of all participants in the meeting The agenda items A calendar of due dates and action items The main points of the discussion Any decisions made during the course of the meeting 4. Think about the future This is a simple but powerful strategy to help you easily avoid the trap of taking down every little detail. While you’re taking minutes, ask yourself if what you’re writing will matter in the future—if not, leave it out. Summarize conversations if they’re truly important and keep emotions out of your notes. 5. Don’t be afraid to speak up You’re taking minutes in a meeting and someone uses a code word or abbreviation you haven’t heard before, or maybe they’re not as articulate as they could be. Do you chime in and ask for clarification? Yes! As the meeting minutes recorder, it can be intimidating to pause the conversation. However, you should speak up if you’re unsure of what someone said or what the group just discussed. If you’re behind, you’re probably not the only one. Here are some phrases that can help get everyone on the same page: “I believe you just said [statement]. Is that correct?” “Sorry if I’m behind the curve here, but could you clarify [concept]?” “I’m not sure I’m following this part of the conversation. Could you recap what you said about [concept]?” “I apologize if this is obvious to everyone, but what does [concept/word] mean?” These tips should help you avoid feeling like you have to fiercely click away at your keyboard to take down everything that’s said. Apply these strategies to your minutes to convey more important ideas with fewer words, and your teammates will thank you.", "date": "2019-07-12,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Trick Your Brain Into Being Productive", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-to-trick-your-brain-into-being-productive/", "abstract": "Ever feel like you’ve worked all day but accomplished almost nothing? You’re not alone. With all the distractions in our lives, from jarring notifications to addictive social media apps, it’s no surprise we struggle to stay productive. For those of us who can’t simply unplug from our digital lives, here are five ways to get the important work done. 1. Eat the frogs According to Forbes contributor and co-founder of TalentSmart Travis Bradberry, “frogs” are the least appealing, most daunting tasks you have to complete. The longer you leave them untouched, the more time you’ll stress over them. If you “eat” (or complete) these tasks as soon as possible, you can stop worrying and devote more time to work that inspires you. To help you tackle your biggest “frog,” create a to-do list in Evernote and set a reminder to get started on it at the beginning of the day. 2. Sprint, rest, repeat Let’s say you’re working on a project that bores you to tears (we’ve all been there). Maybe it’s a long report for which you have to prepare not just text but charts and infographics. Instead of thinking, “I have to write this impossibly long thing,” break the project down into small, digestible tasks. Then you can focus on only the introduction or the first graphic. This allows you to “sprint” until a given task is done, then take a break before moving on to the next one. 3. Be kind to your memory Ever met someone at a party and forgotten their name two minutes later? Or listened carefully to that presentation at work, then left the room and— poof —an important detail escaped you? Our short-term memories have limits , which is why we take notes in the first place. You might be a dutiful notetaker, but if your notes are scattered across a bunch of Word documents or sheets of paper, it’s easy to forget where they are. Evernote keeps track of your notes for you. And if you forget where you saved a note, its powerful search feature will always help you find it. 4. Let yourself (kind of) quit The hardest part of jumping into your work for the day is simply starting. However, once you taste the satisfaction of finishing a task, it’s easier to do more. If you struggle in the morning, pick one important job and tell yourself you can stop working once you finish it. When you complete the task, you may instead feel a sense of drive that will propel you to keep going. Even if you do stop for a break, you can still enjoy a sense of accomplishment. 5. Reclaim your attention Your phone buzzes. It’s a social media notification. You tell yourself you’ll check it quickly then go right back to work, which (let’s be real) is a bald-faced lie. Next thing you know, you’ve been swallowed up into the digital abyss. When something like this happens, it takes time to refocus on what you want to accomplish. As a result, you might struggle to finish (or even start) a task. The solution is simple: Turn off your smartphone or put it in Do Not Disturb mode. That’ll help you avoid distractions and focus solely on your work. Today’s intrusive technology can zap your productivity potential. But with these tips, you can trick your brain into boosting your time management skills, and avoid the distractions that stand between you and your goals.", "date": "2019-06-27,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "A Low-Stress Guide to Wedding Planning", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/low-stress-guide-wedding-planning/", "abstract": "Your wedding should be a reflection of your personality (and your fiancé’s), but fine-tuning every detail can make even simple choices not so simple. If you’re just starting your wedding planning adventure, don’t be afraid to skip certain details . And for the things that truly deserve your attention, here are five tips to help streamline the planning process. 1. Make it a team effort Great ideas will come when you and your future spouse are together as well as when you’re apart. Either way, remember them by keeping them all in one place. Rather than jotting down wedding ideas on scattered scraps of paper, create a “Wedding” notebook in Evernote, share it with your fiancé, and literally get on the same page. It’ll sync with all your devices , so when you add something your partner can see it right away. You can also tag notes to organize them by category, such as “photographer,” “entertainment,” and “honeymoon.” This makes it easy to share timelines and checklists with vendors, venues, and even your entire wedding party. 2. Create your wedding checklist When you’re newly engaged, keeping the important stuff on your radar can be tough. Creating a checklist helps you divvy up tasks with your partner and avoid feeling like you’re forgetting something. Wedding experts at Brides magazine have a full wedding planning outline , starting a year before your wedding date, which you can clip and save in Evernote. In addition, this party planning checklist can help you focus on what matters. Try it out and include the details you have in mind for your big day. 3. Set your budget and guest list Many of your decisions will depend on how much money you can afford to spend and how many people will be attending the wedding. The Knot has a quick and easy budget planning tool to help you break down your wedding costs. Draft a guest list with the approximate number of people you want to invite, then create your budget. Once you know how much you have to spend, you can plug the details into our event budget template and move on from dealing with finances to enjoying the fun stuff . 4. Decide on your vision, theme, and color scheme What’s your entertaining style? A luxurious, upscale affair at a five-star hotel? Or are you more of a backyard barbecue couple? Whatever your vision, gather inspiration from things around you, rather than trying to dream it all up from scratch. If you’re at a restaurant and see a place setting that inspires a theme idea, take a picture and save it to a note shared with your fiancé. If you find a color scheme you like online, Web Clipper can save it alongside all your other ideas. 5. Finalize your date and venue Once you have a clear vision for your wedding day, start thinking about which season would be ideal. Avoid dates close to major holidays and choose times of the year when the weather is appropriate. For example, a beachfront wedding won’t be as much fun in mid-winter. The most popular times for weddings are late spring, summer, and early fall. The Wedding Spot is a great resource to find venues within your price range, and The Knot has an extensive database as well. Your wedding should be one of the happiest days of your life. Keep it low stress by following these planning tips, and remember: the more you accomplish before the big day, the more relaxed you’ll feel when you walk down the aisle. Keep calm, stay organized, and your future self will thank you!", "date": "2019-06-13,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "5 Remarkably Easy Time Management Tips", "author": ["David Perez"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/5-remarkably-easy-time-management-tips/", "abstract": "Do you struggle with productivity at work? If so, you’re not alone. Research shows the average worker is productive for less than three hours a day. And with constant distractions , looming deadlines, and surprise to-do items materializing on your plate, it’s getting even harder to manage time in the workplace. Here are five simple ways you can stop fighting the clock and get more done. 1. Keep important information in one place Think about all the information related to your last big project. Can you see it all at a glance, or is it spread out over multiple apps, websites, files, and scraps of paper? Evernote helps you keep the important parts together. In a single note, you can add text, images, emails, web pages , and more . Your notes are then synced automatically across all your devices, so you can access them anywhere. This helps you see the things that matter side-by-side, without having to switch between countless sources of info. 2. Set a time limit for each task Forbes magazine contributor and Due company founder John Rampton says one of his go-to tips for time management is setting a time limit for each task . By giving yourself a set amount of time to finish something, it’s much easier to cut down on procrastination or outside distractions. Because this time limit is self-imposed, the pressure to finish “on time” feels less like a hard deadline and more like a fun way to challenge yourself. 3. Prioritize your tasks To-do lists help us manage our time…in theory. But what if you’ve tried them and tasks still keep falling through the cracks? It’s tempting to start with the easy stuff, but this can eat into the time needed for more involved projects. It can also leave you trying to tackle the hardest job at the end of a long workday. Instead, try doing more challenging items on your list first. Evernote makes it easy to create checklists in any note. Use this to schedule your more difficult tasks first, and make your workday feel easier and easier as it goes. 4. Plan ahead for your workday Going into work without a clear idea of what you want to accomplish is a recipe for procrastination. The more time you spend jumping between activities to figure out where to dive in, the less time you have to get real work done. Try one of these planning strategies instead: At the end of each day, update your to-do list for the remainder of the week. This helps you prioritize your tasks and allows you to decompress after a long day of work. If you’re more of a morning person, get to work early and plan your to-do list first. Prioritize the most pressing tasks, and create a roadmap for the rest of your day. No matter which option you choose, you can stay on task by setting a reminder in Evernote to update your list. 5. Get rid of distractions from your phone Do you really need an alert every time someone you follow tweets a cat video? If so, no judgment, but it doesn’t have to derail your focus. While taking time to adjust your notification settings can help you avoid distraction, there’s a simpler way that takes literally one second. Silence your phone, and place it screen down while you work. After you’ve finished one of your tasks, go ahead and take a five-minute break to check your phone. But we mean it—five minutes. Managing your time effectively can be a tricky balancing act, but these tips should help you walk the line. Focus on what matters, plan with priorities in mind, don’t let small stuff sap your attention—and get ready to enjoy some hard-earned free time.", "date": "2019-06-20,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Web Clipper: How to Improve Your Browsing Experience Forever", "author": ["Neal Cavanaugh"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/web-clipper-improve-browsing-experience-forever/", "abstract": "Finding what you’ve already found There are over 1.4 billion websites with 140,000 more added every day. That’s a lot of URLs. It’s why Google handles 5.5 billion searches a day, and why so many of those searches return millions of results. So finding the right information is tough. And once you’ve found it, you better not lose track of it. You might be thinking that’s what bookmarks are for . Fair enough. But is a bookmark all you need? If you’re looking for a photo you found on Google images a month ago, or that one paragraph from a long article in The New York Times , or a great deal you spotted on Amazon, a bookmark isn’t enough. Which bookmark is which? Why did you save it? What if the content of the page changed? What if the page isn’t there anymore? Face it: a bookmark is sort of old school. Evernote’s Web Clipper takes the idea of saving and using web resources to a higher level. Save exactly what you want and know exactly how to find it again. Isn’t that what the Internet was for in the first place? Web Clipper is fully integrated with your Evernote account and it’s compatible with all major browsers. With Web Clipper, Evernote becomes a search engine for your saved stuff. How to get started In whatever browser you’re using, simply go to evernote.com/webclipper . You will be directed to a download page to get the Web Clipper extension for your browser. Once installed, you will see a small icon of the Evernote elephant near your browser’s address bar. Click it and sign into Evernote to link Web Clipper to your account. Congratulations. The web is about to become much more useful. PRO TIP: If you’re using a mobile device, clipping works a little differently. Here’s how to clip from iOS and Android » Clip as much (or as little) as you want Thankfully, it takes less time to become a Web Clipper expert than it does to describe it. Once it’s up and running you’ll be clipping in seconds. When you find something on the web that you’d like to be able to find again, you’ve got options. Click on the Web Clipper icon and a pop-up asks you which clipping tool you’d like to use. There’s an option for everything. Here are your choices: Article. In this mode Web Clipper will zero in on the main text and graphics of an article. Highlight what you’re looking for and reduce the clutter. Simplified article. For an even cleaner result, this option simplifies the text formatting and gives you a simple, easy to read version of what you want to save, without things like menus and ads getting in the way. Full Page. Exactly what the name implies. Click this and save the entire page with all text, images, headers, footers, and sidebars. It even digs down to grab stuff that isn’t visible on your screen. Bookmark. This is more than you think. If you choose ‘Bookmark’ you not only save the URL, Evernote adds an image from the site and the text from the page’s meta description. This alone can save you a lot of browsing time. Plus these bookmarks are saved in Evernote, not in your browser’s bookmark file, so you can easily keep them alongside related notes. Screenshot. This is no ordinary screenshot. When you choose this option, crosshairs are displayed. Click and drag to choose as much or as little of the screen as you want. After you’ve made that selection, things get really interesting. A full set of markup tools are displayed. You can highlight, underline, crop, add arrows and pointers, or even pixelate sensitive material out of the content you’ve chosen. Custom Clips. Clipper has special formats for some of the sites you use most often, like Amazon, YouTube, and LinkedIn. When you’re on one of these sites, a special clipping option for that site appears, helping you save just the right information. Choose exactly where to save it You’ve chosen what you want to save and how you want to save it. At this point the Clipper asks you where in Evernote your clip should go, and if you’d like to add tags to the note you’re creating. Notebooks are collections of notes in Evernote, and make it easier to keep related information together (a big help when you need to find things later). When you’re clipping something from the web, Web Clipper shows you a list of all of your notebooks and you simply choose where you’d like to save your new web clip. And if you don’t know at that moment, it will automatically place the new clip in a default notebook and you can move it later. Tags give you another layer of organization in Evernote. Let’s say you found a dining room table you’re thinking of buying. It might go into your “House” notebook and you could add tags like, furniture , dining room , antique , custom made , etc. All of your tags are searchable in Evernote so if you search for the ‘dining room’ tag you’ll find everything you’ve ever tagged related to your new dining room, no matter what notebook it’s in. A new way to see the web Whatever you save via Web Clipper is searchable in Evernote. Everything you clip from the web is stored in one convenient place, organized your way, and easy to find the moment you need it. This really can change your entire relationship with the web.

You’ve got your work email and calendar, your company chat tool, maybe even a security product to help you log into said apps and tools. It’s causing app overload—and more than a little frustration. To unpack this trend, we partnered with data analytics firm YouGov for a U.S. survey, and found that: 83 percent of respondents use 1-4 devices daily. 65 percent use up to 9 different apps every day. Nearly 1 in 4 said they use their apps either equally between personal and professional use, or more on the professional side. Over 60 percent reported feeling ‘somewhat’ or ‘very frustrated’ when they cannot find something they need related to apps and the internet. You probably feel this in your own life as well. You’ve got projects, deliverables, notes, and conversations happening all over the place. Your team might spend as much time managing the process, switching between tools, and hunting down info as you do actually doing the job. All of this can take a toll. Because success isn’t just about what your team does; it’s also about how you do it. When it comes to workflows , it’s all about streamlining how you get things done while still fitting your team’s working style and the tools you already use. This is why it’s important to look for tools that play well together. The good news is that with Spaces , the new Evernote Business feature, and a few pretty handy integrations, you can connect the apps you already use and build a workflow that works for your team. Start a free trial of Evernote Business » Here are five ways you can use Evernote Business to get the most out of your apps at work: 1) Slack By connecting Evernote to Slack , you can save important conversations or pull up relevant notes to tie together your communication, ideas, and work.

For example, you could clip an entire conversation about a project from Slack, saving it as a note in Evernote that can then be pinned to your team’s space.  Bringing the two tools together helps you take a step out of your workflow, making it easier to access and share your ideas from one place. Learn more about using Evernote for Slack » 2) Google Drive If your company uses the Google Drive suite, you can keep the files you create in context alongside your notes and ideas in Evernote. Drop docs, slides, and sheets right into notes in your team’s space.

With Spaces, you can add important files to a note and pin it in your team’s space so it’s always handy. You can also use the ‘What’s new’ feature to see recently added documents. What’s more is that Google Drive files automatically update in Evernote, so you don’t have to worry about having the latest version. By using the two tools together, you can track projects from ideation to iteration, even if it doesn’t neatly fit into a single document.

Take the next step. How do you know when it’s time to put a ring on it? There are a lot of compelling reasons to upgrade to Evernote Premium, and they’re as unique as the ways you use it. How do you know when the time is right? 1. You want Evernote with you wherever you go. The free version of Evernote lets you sync across two devices. For most people, that means a computer and a phone. But what if you want it on your home computer, work computer, work phone, personal phone, and your tablet? If you depend on Evernote to keep you synced everywhere, Premium lets you add it on unlimited devices. Pro tip: Accessing your account from the web on any computer doesn’t count toward your devices, but there are more fish in the sea. Why limit your options? You can do a lot more with the desktop or mobile app. So be sure to install the Evernote on all your devices. 2. You’re putting more and more of yourself into Evernote. Evernote isn’t the garage where you store old stuff you might need someday. Evernote is more like a personal search engine to help your information stay vibrant and relevant to your life every day. That being said, the free version of Evernote caps your uploads per month at 60 MB. If you’re hitting your quota early, it’s time to upgrade. With Premium, you get a 166 times more room every month for ideas, thoughts, photos, or whatever your heart desires. 3. You’re torn between your passion for PDFs and your love for Evernote. PDFs and Microsoft Office documents come from everywhere. Contracts, scripts, user guides, white papers and studies, and ebooks arrive via email or the web daily. Send them to Evernote to read later, but if you need to find something within a PDF or an Office document—say, a quote, or a phrase—you need Premium to help you search. And if you mark up PDFs to highlight sections, draw, edit, or annotate them, Evernote Premium will let you do that. 4. It’s time for Evernote to meet your friends and colleagues. Everyone has and hands out business cards, and nobody wants to keep or organize them. With Evernote Premium, you can not only scan those cards, but they’ll automatically save to your contacts . What you do with the physical card after that is up to you. 5. You and Evernote want to deepen your communication. You already rely on Evernote to help you find the stuff you’ve saved, but things get even better when Evernote suggests other notes related to your search. If you’re writing a paper about Thomas Jefferson, for example, and you’re searching for your notes, Evernote Premium will remind you that you’ve clipped a few articles about him and that cool rap from Hamilton , too. Pro tip: With Evernote Premium, you also get support via chat and email. 6. You’re willing to be in a long-distance relationship with Evernote. If you find yourself using Evernote without internet access, having Premium can be a money-saver. Premium lets you download notebooks you use often, so you don’t need internet to consult your notes. If you add anything to a note while disconnected, Evernote will sync it back up when you connect. Ready to take the plunge? Upgrade to Evernote Premium today.", "date": "2018-02-14,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Evernote: The Engine of Productivity for Freelancers", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/the-engine-of-productivity-for-freelancers/", "abstract": "Flexibility. Freedom. Engagement. Respect. Earning potential. Work-life balance. These are just a few of the factors that have influenced the growing crop of freelancers in the United States and beyond. Today, more than 55 million people in the United States identify as freelancers, workers who have an earning potential of more than $1 trillion. Representing all sorts of professions like designers, marketers, analysts, and writers, the number of freelancers has grown three times faster than that of the entire United States workforce since 2014. By 2027, more people will identify as freelancers than any other American job category. For many freelancers, Evernote is the primary tool to help manage their workload. Here’s how Evernote can help you along every step of your freelancing journey. Accomplish more by starting and staying organized Getting organized even before you get started with a freelance client or project is key to your success. There’s no wrong way to set up your system in Evernote, but committing to a consistent one will make your workflow easier. Separate your clients by creating a notebook for each one. Keep every note, email, document, photo, or audio file in that notebook. To organize even further, make notebook stacks , which are collections of notebooks that you group together. For example, you might keep all your drafts for the client in one notebook; finished, approved work in another; and invoices and checks in another. When they’re all stacked together, you’ll always know where to find the piece you need. You can even narrow down your search to a particular notebook and find what you need that much faster. Another way to organize with Evernote is through tags . When you land a new client, assign tags to each piece of content that relates to that client. How you tag is dependent on how you prefer to use Evernote, but here are a few suggestions: Tag, you’re it. Use tag(s) to identify key contacts and collaborators on the project. Assign each individual to the project name or title so that you can find them fast when you need to find relevant notes. The home for random ideas. Never forget the ideas that come when you least expect it. When you’re inspired, save ideas, photos, audio clips, or scanned images into Evernote and tag them as ‘story ideas’ so you can rediscover them later. The next idea you capture could be your next big pitch. Freelancers can have virtual assistants too Many people think of Evernote as just a place to take and store notes, but for freelancers, it can be so much more. When you freelance, it’s all up to you, so why not bring in some help? After all, Evernote can be your reminder service, research assistant, idea factory, communication and sharing center, and even a way to keep all your tax documents safe and together. Here are just a few ways Evernote makes your freelance life smoother: Don’t let anything fall through the cracks. Add reminders with due dates so you can track milestones and deliverables. You’ll find reminders in a to-do list pinned at the top of your note list. You can sort them, annotate them, or mark them complete as you work on the project, so you always know where you left off. You can set it up to get email alerts when each item in your reminders list is due. Create a research repository. With the help of Web Clipper , instantly transfer your internet research directly to Evernote. You can send the stuff you save right to a note to help you along with your other freelance work. Or clip your published work as an archive of work samples. Handle communication. Don’t let email get lost in the shuffle. Forward it directly to Evernote. By sending email to Evernote , you can collect all the details into that client’s notebook to find later. Pro Tip : Jump right into the particulars of your work using templates in Evernote. It’s all set up for you—whether it’s brainstorming ideas or meeting to kick off a project —thanks to a whole host of helpful, reusable forms. All business, all the time For a freelancer, there’s typically just one person running the show: you. With the help of a few Evernote integrations, you can plug some powerful apps into your workflow to save time. Here are just a few: IFTTT can be particularly helpful when it comes to working together with clients who prefer services other than Evernote to moderate and manage projects. A few IFTTT applets you could choose include: Automatically create a new Trello card when you add a new note to a specific Evernote notebook. Use Evernote with Siri. Create a note with Google Assistant . When you close out a project, archive notes to Google Drive by using the ‘Drive’ tag. Zapier : Like IFTTT, Zapier automates tasks outside of Evernote. For example, Zapier lets you create a Google calendar event from an Evernote reminder, get Slack notifications, and save Google contacts to Evernote, just to name a few of these timesavers. Pocket: Curate, review, and save articles to Evernote with the ‘save to Evernote’ feature in Pocket’s native app. Slack: If you’re an enthusiast of this all-in-one communication platform (we are here at Evernote!) you can now create private notes and share note links right from within Slack. Best of all, your notes stay private until you decide to share them. Accounting 101 Once you’ve finished a contract, it’s time to get paid. Evernote can help you with that, too. Use the Evernote camera on your smartphone to scan checks, invoices, receipts, and other payment documents and save them into Evernote. You’ll need them when it comes time to pay your quarterly taxes. T ag any notes that are related to contract money ‘payment.’ At the end of the year, you can pull up all your pay-related documents with one search. That’ll make tax preparation much simpler. Pro Tip: If you want to organize even further, create a note link that connects to your contract or client note so you can track payments back to their sources. On the flip side, freelancers need to monitor expenses. Tag notes with “expenses” or “expenses + year,” and at the end of the tax year, you’ll have a record of all your payments in one place. Export those into a PDF or move them into a spreadsheet for tax purposes. Finding your next freelance gig Landing your next opportunity is one of the most time-consuming aspects of freelancing. Looking for work becomes part of your daily job, so it’s vital to have a process in place to track opportunities and network with potential job leads. Stay connected. From conferences and conventions to meetups and happy hours, your next gig could be a handshake away. Use Evernote on your smartphone to scan business cards to exchange information and gather contacts—all before you leave the event. Social opportunity. A lot of freelancers are using social media channels to connect with influencers and find new gigs. There’s so much to take in, how can you keep track of it all? In Evernote. Here’s how: Within a note, create a table to track not only your work search activity, and all the social channels where you network. Add hyperlinks or even include a document directly from Google Drive . Keep a portfolio of your work in Evernote, and share single notes or an entire notebook link with potential clients in seconds, from wherever you are. Drag and drop files, images, or links directly into a note and then create and paste a public link (URL) for the note to share it. Clients can view the note from any device or browser whether they have an Evernote account or not. Pro Tip: Try Postach.io , an Evernote-based blogging platform that lets you create a personal portfolio website. Include clippings, files, images, and screenshots that provide potential clients with a view of your best work. Creating a post to your Postach.io blog is as easy as creating a note in Evernote and tagging it ‘publish.’ Connecting the dots Freelancing isn’t just for creatives. Contractors and freelance workers come from every walk of life; from office employees to medical and technical professionals to service workers. As more of us join the ranks of gig-seekers, Evernote helps keep us focused, organized, and productive. With Evernote, you can gain a real professional edge in a competitive landscape.", "date": "2017-11-7,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "8 Tips for Mastering a More Paperless Life with Evernote", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/tips-for-a-more-paperless-life-with-evernote/", "abstract": "Even in the digital age, paper is still very much a modern reality. Don’t let it be a burden. Instead, manage it all with Evernote. Scan receipts, business cards, and documents as they come to you. Or, address a large cluttered pile in a single sitting. Whatever your approach to paper may be, Evernote’s powerful paperless features let you handle it all with grace. Here are eight tactics to help you manage and minimize the paper in your life. 1. Configure your workflow Before you begin, it’s helpful to ask yourself a few questions about your paper-based documents and decide what you can do with them. This chart is a great place to start. 2. Don’t stress it, scan it Scanning allows you to preserve documents. Scanning them into Evernote is as simple as using your smart device’s camera.While in the app, just tap the camera icon, point your device at the item you want to scan and collect everything from instruction manuals, the kids’ homework, and bank statements to work documents and meetings notes. You can decide later if you need to keep the physical copy, or if you’d rather toss it. 3. Manage business cards like a pro At any gathering or conference, business cards only get out of hand if you let them. Mitigate the likelihood of losing cards, or misplacing your own, by scanning them immediately into Evernote . Evernote Premium recognizes the elements of a business card (name, title, company,  phone number, and email address) and creates both an image of the card and an editable contact entry automatically. 4. Collect your digital files In addition to paper documents, your company likely has digital documents and files scattered across a plethora of personal computers and shared drives. Collect them in Evernote so everyone can find the files they need and collaborate with the team. You don’t necessarily want or need to move every file into Evernote. Instead, think of the files and identify documents that are regularly shared among the team, or ones that multiple people could benefit from accessing. Pro Tip : Files you may want to move into Evernote are ones related to specific projects, company policies, product reference information, and sales tools. 5. Own paperless productivity with IFTTT, Pocket, and Evernote See something you like that you’d like to save to read later?  Pocket lets you grab links, images, and videos and save them for later. But how can you search through all the material you’ve saved and find it again quickly? That’s where IFTTT comes in. This IFTTT recipe syncs everything you save to Pocket into a notebook of your choice in Evernote. You can also tell IFTTT to only sync items you’ve starred in Pocket, so you only move the things you’re sure you want to keep permanently. Learn more about how IFTTT works with Evernote » 6. Automate Evernote Did you know that you can use a few simple tricks to automate items from your social media and IRL activity and save them into Evernote? From tracking your tweets to recording health information, there’s a way to automate that. Here are just a few: Keep a record of all the tweets you’ve favorited. Use this IFTTT recipe to save tweets to a notebook of your choice. Track your physical activity from your Fitbit with a simple IFTTT recipe . Keep meeting minutes and other important information in Evernote, and refer to it wherever and whenever you need it. Note: we do not recommend that you use Evernote to store passwords. Use a password management app like Dashlane or LastPass . Write and manage a blog using Evernote and Postach.io. 7. Templates make repetitive work bearable Do you have processes or forms that you repeat often? Evernote can help you streamline them. Or, if you’re at a loss where to start when Evernote presents you with a blank slate, templates can provide inspiration by showing what’s possible. The Evernote website is a great place to start finding templates for tasks many businesses and students do every day, but there are also many designers online who offer templates that cover topics as diverse as shopping, travel, exercise, habit tracking, and much more. When you come across a template you like, click on the link to open it. Then click Save to Evernote to easily add the template as a note to your Evernote account. In fact, Evernote Business can help you and your team eliminate most of the paper that meetings invariably generate. Meetings tend to revolve around the same types of documents, like minutes, agendas, and presentations.  Use Evernote Business to create templates for these notes. They’ll give your team a pre-formatted structure to save them time. Pro tip: Create a notebook and store all your templates in it. When you’re ready to use one, just open the notebook, select the template you want, and then copy it to a new note or notebook. That way you’ll always have a fresh copy when you want to use it again. Read more about templates and download a few. 8. Paperless meetings Printing presentations, documents, or web pages with important research wastes time and paper. As you’re getting ready for a meeting, attach presentation files and documents directly to your meeting agenda note, and the team members you’ve shared that note with will automatically get access to those files. Clip important Internet research using the Web Clipper , share those notes with your team as well. If you’re using an iOS device, Evernote is the quickest way to capture documents. It’s super fast, and a beautiful way to archive your content. Learn more about running meetings with Evernote »", "date": "2017-10-10,"},

He’s the ambassador to the Evernote community, and if you’ve ever been to one of his live events, you know they’re always jam-packed with productivity enthusiasts from all walks of life, ready to soak up the latest tips and tricks from Josh and his hand-picked panelists of Evernote Certified Consultants . November saw Josh in Australia and Singapore, presenting an evening of productivity expertise, tips, and tricks for small business to sold-out crowds. We hosted about a dozen live events in 2016, and there will be more in the coming year. These meet-ups are a great way to network with your local community and get expert advice on bringing the most out of Evernote. Find upcoming events in your area by visiting the Evernote Community Calendar. Sydney: Sophistication and startups Josh’s whirlwind trip began with events at WeWork and General Assembly sites in Sydney. WeWork provides a shared space for new, up-and-coming startups to get off the ground. General Assembly, a global tech training company, organized each of the events, which drew as many as between 400 and 600 registrants in each city he visited. (L-R)  Speakers Helen Crozier, Maxime Groenewoud, Josh Zerkel, Stas Svamin, and Ivor Lok in Sydney “I have to admit, I was pretty tired when I arrived,” Josh said of his 24-hour journey from Evernote HQ in California. “But Sydney is so vibrant,” he added. “There’s an energy there that I can only describe as boisterous. The people re-energized me.” Sydney, the largest city in Australia, has a slick and sophisticated atmosphere with massive high-rise buildings, and a thriving start-up culture. “Almost everyone in the room said they were Evernote users,” he remembered. “The audience came from startups, both tech and non-technical, and they rely on Evernote for their business. They had so many questions, especially how to best use it for teams.” Watch Josh’s post-show Periscope as he talks about the Sydney event Melbourne: where the “cool factor” drives a tech economy Melbourne’s “bohemian” style came as a surprise to Josh. The city is in the process of creating its own Silicon Valley, with companies located in older buildings, warehouses, decorated with exposed brick and lights. “It’s very San Francisco-like,” Josh mused. “There’s a perpetual battle going on between Sydney and Melbourne about which city is better, which is more liveable, cooler, and which has the best tech.” Josh is not taking sides. “Both cities are trying to do it their own way. Both have charm and appeal, and both are filled with people who are thrilled to be in small business in the tech space.” They were so thrilled, in fact, that more than 600 people registered for Josh’s Melbourne event at Inspire9 , a co-working space for startups, freelancers, and other creative professionals. The audience came to learn more about small business productivity, and to discuss how to stay productive with clients by using Evernote. Barbara Clifford of The Time Tamer, a productivity and time management consulting agency, told audiences how she uses Evernote to manage client relationships, turning it into a “mini CRM.” When she captures a business card using Evernote, Barbara can then do additional research on that person and save it all in Evernote. She uses those notes as an ongoing place to record ongoing interactions, meetings, and phone calls. Paul Murray, a Melbourne IT consultant, focused on the GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology, and how he has experimented using different implementations of GTD in Evernote. Paul explained that even small customizations in GTD can make enormous differences to his effectiveness, without sacrificing the fairly strict GTD methodology. He told the Melbourne crowd that he periodically revisits his notebooks and tags to make sure that the nomenclature and setup is still best for the current needs of his business. “We talked about GTD a lot,” Josh recalled. “One thing that that came out of this discussion is while there are guidelines in GTD, there is no one right way. Everyone seems to customize it to suit their needs.” Listen to Josh reflect on the Melbourne event on Periscope . Singapore: Diversity in culture, business, and ways to use Everno te Singapore is a crossroads of nations, a city-state located only one degree north of the equator. In Singapore, it’s possible to find century-old shops co-existing with sparkling new mixed-use skyscrapers. The spirit of diversity is reflected in not just the architecture, but in the myriad of cultures that live and work together in this tropical city and tech hub in Southeast Asia. It’s also a center of fun and adventure for the young on a Friday night, with endless entertainment options, nightclubs, restaurants, and bars. When he arrived in Singapore, Josh was astounded to find a rare temperate Friday evening, with no humidity, and the air and water so clear the buildings reflected on the city’s famous waterfront. It was such an unusual change in weather that Josh was, at first, concerned that no one would come to his event at the National Trades Union Congress ( NTUC Centre ). He was in for a pleasant surprise. Adrian Koh addresses the Singapore audience “The place was packed!” Josh exclaimed. His far-reaching agenda might be the reason. Topics ranged from content management to product development, business team tracking to client management. The topics were as diverse as the audience, and, like Singapore itself, provided a wide range of options that all worked within a single space. “It was amazing to see new ways people are using Evernote to help them work,” Josh observed. “It’s especially gratifying to hear what differences Evernote is making all over the world.” Review the Singapore event with Josh’s Periscope video", "date": "2016-11-29,"},

She presented two templates to help small businesses ensure that their office is ready for the new year, and to help shut down the office for the holidays. Katie recommends capturing all your tasks in one long note, and then separating the list into items you need to do right away, things you can delegate, and items you can do later. Katie’s Pro Tip: “Convert those three lists into three separate notes, and attach checkboxes and reminders to each task list. Let Evernote remind you—and the people you’ve delegated tasks to—when they’re due.” Get Katie’s small business templates » Frank Gerber of BlueShift Partners has plenty of tricks up his sleeve for making year ’round travel as painless as possible. Because he lives in California’s Bay Area, he’s always asked: ‘Where are some great places to go in San Francisco? Where should I eat?’ To help his friends navigate the almost endless choices of a San Francisco visit, Frank wrote a guide to San Francisco and shared it as a public notebook. By sharing it, he’s giving his friends an insider’s guide right on their devices. And when he finds a new treasure, he updates the notebook once, and the changes go out to everyone. For Frank, Evernote was the perfect application to share suggestions with friends and family quickly. Since he loves to travel, he created travel and hosting templates to help make traveling and visiting a breeze. Get Frank’s San Francisco Bay Area guide » Get Frank’s travel templates » Frank’s Pro Tip: “Credit cards often come with travel benefits that you don’t remember you have. Create a note for each credit card you carry and list all the perks you get with each one. If you review those before you go on a trip, you can save a lot of money.” SiNing Chan , Evernote’s Senior Technical Writer, sees Evernote as an invaluable organizational tool for everyone, regardless of productivity style. “What’s more important to you?” she asked audiences. “Maximizing your time, or maximizing your energy?” Knowing your productivity style can help you enjoy a more stress-free holiday. For ‘time-maximizers,’ she recommends using Evernote for planning holiday projects such as holiday cards and gifts.

Evernote’s Engineering Manager, Kathryn Kohler , shared how anyone can appear as if they have organization superpowers with Evernote. She uses Evernote as a repository for everything that comes into her head. “Set it and forget it,” she said. “Everything goes in there.” Kathryn uses this system to stay informed during her one-on-one meetings with her team. To her, it’s too stressful to try to remember everything you said and did and promised. “Write everything down in Evernote, and then later you can go back and see what you promised.” It’s a technique that she uses with her husband, too. “If there’s a disagreement, I can just pull up my phone and say, ‘no, on this date, I said this and you said you’d do that’,” she said with a laugh.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Steve Jobs: Three Steps to Making Connections that Matter", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/three-steps-to-make-connections-that-matter/", "abstract": "William James wrote that “The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.” If that’s true, Steve Jobs may have been one of the wisest men of the late 20th century. Jobs may not have been a “creator,” but his sense of design touches almost all of our daily lives—even if you’ve never used an Apple product in your life. It’s hard to think of a product released in the last few decades that hasn’t emulated Jobs’ and Apple’s aesthetic of simplicity. In the mid-1970s, Jobs dropped out of college to travel through India. While recovering from dysentery, he read Paramahansa Yogananda’s Autobiography of a Yogi , which began a fascination with Eastern religion that would last the rest of his life. According to his friend Larry Brilliant, “Steve had been flirting with the idea of being sadhu , ” meaning becoming an ascetic who has renounced worldly goods. While this might seem an odd career path for someone who eventually headed one of the most pervasive technology companies in the world, those interests, and that mindset led to a lifelong quest to make things so simple and obvious in their design and function that they were almost intuitive to use at first glance. 1. Making things simple is more than just making things easy That simplicity is the first lesson we can take from him. Simplicity is more than just making things easy. If that were the case, iPhones and Macs would have on/off switches. Simplicity means anticipating how a user will perceive a product and how the product will make sense to people. The process of taking a product or an idea to its most basic and necessary elements takes time, though. In 1988, Jobs told Business Week “That’s been one of my mantras—simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.” People’s lives are complicated enough. We don’t want to read instruction manuals on how to use a product. We buy it, take it out of the box, and want to use it right away. So it behooves a designer or a writer to take the time to figure out the message a product or content is conveying and how customers receive it. An informative message will go unread if it’s too complicated or confusing. The most powerful phone or computer in the world will sit on a desk gathering dust if it takes an advanced degree to run it. Along with that simplicity, though, must come innovation. Think of the first time you saw or used a smartphone. The attraction wasn’t just that it was easy to use (a rubber band is easy to use), it was that it was innovative. It was something people had never seen before, yet presented in a way that was both new and intuitive. “Well, of course! Why didn’t anyone ever think of that before?” “You can’t ask customers what they want and then give it to them. By the time you get it built, they’ll want something new.” —Steve Jobs 2. Enrich Your Life With New Experiences…and Ask Questions It’s easy enough to say “be innovative” (or “ Think Different ,” as Apple’s famous tagline proclaimed), but how does a person do it? Unfortunately, while there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to that question, having that very problem is actually a strength in Jobs’s view. In 1982, in accepting an award from the Academy of Achievement, he said , “If you’re gonna make connections which are innovative…you have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does…or else you’re going to make the same connections (as everybody else), and then you won’t be innovative, and then nobody will give you an award.” Jobs encouraged his audiences and employees to take advantage of their uniqueness and to do neither what was expected nor what the person next door was doing. In his speech to the Academy, he encouraged listeners to take the time to travel, to see and experience things, to read, and to try different things. He said, “I heard about some kid that’s 14 on his way to Stanford, and that’s great…but you might want to think about going to Paris and being a poet for a few years. Or you might want to go to a third-world country. It’s very much, so worth doing.” The more we experience—and especially personally, not just vicariously—not only will our lives be richer, but we’ll also be better trained to notice new things. Experience allows us to see connections between things that others may not notice. But even as exposure to the new and unfamiliar will broaden and deepen a person, simplicity shouldn’t be forgotten. The simplest question of all is “Why?” Children ask this all the time, not just because they don’t understand how things work, but also to make the unfamiliar familiar—to make connections between what they know and what they don’t. If we can think like children—not in a childish way, but to strip away our preconceptions and assumptions about what things are and how they work, we can make new connections and innovations. We shouldn’t take things for granted, but ask how they can be bettered. Making something “simpler” or “better” doesn’t always mean less complicated, though. Sometimes an additional feature or step can make the difference between not quite right and just right. There’s a famous anecdote about Jobs and the first iPhone. It was virtually ready to be produced when: “Jobs holds the device in his hand…He takes the headphone jack and inserts it into the iPod. The engineers await in tense silence. Something is wrong, and Jobs hasn’t even hit play yet. He takes the jack out and inserts it again. Then he does it again. Dread descends on the group. The planned launch is only days away. Jobs frowns and finally pronounces, “Where’s the click?” The exhausted engineers say, “Click? What are you talking about?” “I mean that people need a click when they insert the jack,” says Jobs. “Without the click, they won’t know that it’s properly in there. They will keep working it and worrying with the headphones until they break. The solution is not elegant. This is not design thinking.” When a person can notice those “clicks” (or lack thereof) in things, connections and innovations can be made—but only if one has the awareness and breadth of experience to notice them. 3. Creativity Is Just Connecting Things In a previous entry about Mark Twain, we noted that Twain believed that there were no original ideas. He said, “The kernel, the soul—let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterances—is plagiarism. … It takes a thousand men to invent the telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or the telephone or any other important thing—and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others. With this in mind, it almost behooves us to expose ourselves to as much knowledge and inspiration we can find from any source to synthesize it and, ironically, make it our own.” Jobs was of much the same mind. In 1995, he told Wired Magazine : “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’d had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’d had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.” A lot of people who haven’t had very diverse experiences end up with linear solutions to problems because they don’t have a broad perspective. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better innovations we will have. In the same interview, he said “The Web reminds me of the early days of the PC industry. No one really knows anything. There are no experts. All the experts have been wrong. There’s a tremendous open possibility to the whole thing. And it hasn’t been confined, or defined, in too many ways. That’s wonderful. There’s a phrase in Buddhism, “Beginner’s mind.” It’s wonderful to have a beginner’s mind.” Jobs was by no means perfect or a role model; famously, he could be downright awful to people. We shouldn’t emulate the thought processes that brought on his bad behavior. However, his commitment to being exposed to as many experiences as possible and looking at things in unprejudiced ways to make them simpler and/or better are things we can all do; it just takes patience, observation, practice, and the commitment to make the good better and the better as perfect as possible.", "date": "2017-05-8,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Decluttering Made Simple: Clean Your Space, Clear Your Mind", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/decluttering-made-simple/", "abstract": "We all want to be organized and productive,\nbut sometimes the path is blocked—literally. Our homes and offices are full of\nclutter: documents, junk mail, things we bought five years ago and never use,\nand all the random “stuff” that seems to accumulate every day. The problem isn’t only one of appearances. A growing body of research shows all that clutter is adding real stress to our lives . And that keeps us from focusing on the important things. Cleaning up the mess, reducing your paper footprint, and regaining peace of mind can seem like an impossible challenge, but you really can declutter your spaces and get out from under the mess. All it takes is a bit of Marie Kondo -style decision making, a bit of self-discipline, and Evernote. Step 1: Go paperless. Digitize your documents and stop paper usage before it begins. According to the University of Southern Indiana , Americans collectively use two billion trees’ worth of paper and other tree-based products per year. Globally, more than 400 billion metric tons of paper and cardboard are produced each year. You may have tons of paper scattered throughout your home, from vital records to junk mail and bills, which means that decluttering your paper documents can free up more space than you realized. To reduce your paper clutter, sort through your documents and categorize them into things you need to keep, paper you should digitize, and paper you can recycle right away. Important documents such as birth certificates and family mementos are worth keeping, but you could probably part with your collection of takeout menus and business cards. Recycle the items that you can get rid of right away. Store the paper you want to keep in a filing cabinet or special box and use your phone to scan the other documents into Evernote . Consider setting up dedicated notebooks or tags for each type of document (such as “receipts,” “user manuals,” or “correspondence”) so you can find them again fast. But remember that Evernote will also find text in images , so your system doesn’t have to be perfect. If you don’t need to keep the original copies, recycle them. Digitizing and going paperless is an easy way to clear up physical space. To further reduce your paper usage , go paperless whenever possible. Sign up to receive and pay your bills electronically rather than by mail. Recycle any junk mail when it comes to your mailbox immediately and remove your name from junk mail lists if you can. Instead of relying on paper to-do lists and notes, keep Evernote handy on all your devices so you can type out these items on the fly. Step 2: Go green. Emphasize composting and recycling in your home. When you’re sorting through your home clutter,\nyou may get the urge to toss everything into the trash and call it a day. But\nmany items can cause harm to the environment, so discarding of what you don’t\nneed should be done thoughtfully. Fortunately, there are sustainable methods\nthat you can follow to reduce your clutter. Consider separating your items into\nrecyclable, compostable, and donation piles. Items such as plastic and paper\ncan go to the recycling bin, and you can add natural materials to your compost\npile, like wood or fabric. For items that are still in good condition,\nconsider taking them to your local homeless shelter, thrift store, or nursing\nhome. These options are preferable to sending your clutter to the dump, where\nthey will probably sit in a landfill for centuries. Once you’ve gotten into the habit of recycling, composting, or donating things you don’t need, there are steps you can take to ensure you’ll have less to discard in the first place. Think about cutting back on single-use items . Try using greener products with less packaging and fewer plastic components. Step 3: Go minimal. Commit to using what you have now. As millions of people have discovered from watching Marie Kondo’s Netflix series , more stuff does not always mean a happier life. Adopting a minimalist attitude can declutter our spaces, give us more time to focus, and even increase our happiness by changing the definition of personal satisfaction. But don’t throw everything away. When you’re decluttering your home or office, you may find stockpiles of items you don’t need at that moment but will need in the future, such as office supplies, bottles of shampoo, or bars of soap. Keep those but refrain from purchasing any new products until you use up what you have. Of course, always recycle all possible packaging after you finish using these products. This will help you save on both money and resources. With these tips, you can declutter your home, straighten up your desk, and enjoy a cleaner, more productive space. Remember to take it slow, think sustainably, and focus on reducing your waste, especially when it comes to paper usage. And be proud of your achievement. Because making a difference in your personal life can make a difference in the world, too.", "date": "2019-04-22,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Zapier’s New Slack Action Will Power Up Your Life", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/zapiers-new-slack-action-power-life/", "abstract": "When communications app Slack first introduced Slack Actions in May 2018, users everywhere rejoiced. Suddenly you didn’t have to remember obscure ‘slash’ commands to integrate with apps like Evernote ; it was as simple and painless as clicking a menu item . Now Zapier has joined the party, launching a set of Slack Actions that enable you to connect Evernote with your other favorite apps—such as Airtable , Todoist , and over 1,300 others—all from right within your Slack conversations. Evernote hearts Zapier While we’d love to say that Evernote is the only app you’ll ever need, your information is probably spread across a variety of apps. In fact, research firm App Annie found the average smartphone owner uses 10 apps every day. That’s where Zapier comes in. It connects your apps by creating what it calls “Zaps,” automated workflows you can set up to share information between the apps you use most. Some of the most popular Zaps for Evernote include connections with Google Calendar, Trello, Asana, and Dropbox, but there are hundreds more options as well. And we’re proud to say Evernote is one of the most popular apps among Zapier’s users. How is Zapier’s new Slack Action different? Previously, Zaps were triggered automatically when you took a specific action in Evernote or a connected app. For example, creating a reminder in Evernote might set off a process that generated a matching entry in Google Calendar (or vice versa). While you can still work this way, Zapier’s new Slack Action ups your game significantly. It automates the process of sharing information among multiple apps, so you won’t miss a beat. With this integration, you can send the contents of any Slack message—along with helpful information like channel name, username, and any optional text you add—to Evernote to create a new note, append to an existing note, or create a tag. You can then log that message to an Airtable database, create a task in Todoist, and more—all in one fell swoop. How to get started After you create a Zapier account and connect it to Evernote, set up a new Zap using the Slack “New Pushed Message” as a trigger. Then select an Evernote action, like “Append to Note” or “Create Note.” If it’s a multi-step Zap, select any additional actions such as “Create a Record” in Airtable or “Create a Task” in Todoist. Give your Zap a name then turn it on! When you see a Slack message you want to save, click the “…” next to the message and select “Push to Zapier.” A dialog will pop up asking which Zap you want to run. Select the Zap you created earlier and click “Push.” Zapier will send the contents of the Slack message to Evernote as well as taking any other actions you’ve set up. Life moves fast, and you need to juggle projects, information, and ideas like never before. You can easily lose hours switching between apps or entering data, and action items can get lost in all that noise. With Zapier’s new Slack Action, save any Slack message into Evernote alongside the rest of your work, and automatically share it with the other apps you use on a daily basis. Try it for yourself today and see how you can save time and keep everyone on the same page.", "date": "2019-02-12,"},

Today is my first day as CEO of Evernote. This morning, the Evernote board announced to the team that Chris O’Neill was leaving the company and that I was joining as CEO. We are all hugely appreciative of the energy and dedication Chris has shown over the last 3 years, and in particular for putting Evernote on a solid financial footing so we can continue to build for the future. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do. Build the future. When Stepan Pachikov founded Evernote, he had a vision for how technology could augment memory and how an app could change the way we relate to information at home and at work. Evernote has been more successful at making progress towards Stepan’s dreams than he could have imagined, but Stepan and I both think that there is more to explore and more to invent. I am a dedicated note taker. An inveterate list maker. A relentless task organizer. I love to work in teams. To get my hands dirty making content with others. To experience many minds working together as one. To learn from the people I work with. Evernote helps me do many of these things well today. For some of the others, we are only just starting to scratch the surface. I am looking forward to getting us back on the trail of inventing the future, creating a renewed Evernote that gives you—our community, customers, and partners—even more reasons to fall in love with us all over again. I look forward to learning from you about what you rely on us for today, and what you’d like to rely on us for tomorrow. I look forward to hearing from you about where we’ve fallen short and how we can do better. I look forward to working hard to continue to earn the trust that you place in us every day, and to earn your support in this new role I have taken on. It’s a real privilege to join this community. And a real responsibility to lead this team. Let’s invent the future, together. —Ian P.S.: From as far back as I can remember, I have strong memories of my mother collecting elephant mementos. From the first day I talked with Evernote about taking on this role, I thought about all those elephants and had the sense that today was somehow just meant to be.", "date": "2018-10-29,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Evernote Named One of Zapier’s Top 10 Apps", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-named-one-of-zapiers-top-10-apps/", "abstract": "It’s a fast-moving world out there, and busy professionals need to juggle projects, data, and ideas like never before. In a typical workday, hours can be lost managing tools or doing data entry. Add in all the personal components of your online life, and it can feel like you spend more time hopping between apps than actually using them. That’s why we love Zapier , a service that automates tasks by connecting more than 700 apps and tools in custom workflows (they call them Zaps). A lot of Evernote fans agree with us: Evernote was one of the 10 most popular apps among Zapier’s users in 2017, along with popular web tools such as Trello, Google Suite, and Slack (all of which can integrate with Evernote). “If a team member makes a new comment in Evernote, my Zap notifies me.” The idea is simple: when information is added to one app, Zapier can use it in another app — or multiple apps — in ways you define. Any time you create a new note for a meeting or project , for example, Zapier can add a task to your to-do list, send an email, add a link to your CRM platform, or all three. Zapier can also create notes, notebooks, and tags in Evernote, or append new information to an existing note. Austin Hyland, a Developer Evangelist at Cisco, created a Zap to connect his Evernote account to Cisco Spark, a business collaboration platform for meetings and messaging: “If a team member makes a new comment in Evernote, my Zap notifies me (with the message) in my Spark room!” he says. And it runs automatically, so he can focus on getting work done. Resolve to connect New Year’s resolutions are on a lot of people’s minds right now, and studies show that getting more organized routinely tops people’s lists (it’s second behind only physical fitness). A big part of getting organized is simplifying—centering your attention on the things that matter and finding ways to delegate or streamline the rest. So why not start with your apps? Sometimes even a small bit of automation can make a big difference. Consider the case of Pete Happy, owner of Pro-Shine, a window washing business in Oregon. He found that connecting apps could not only simplify his routine, but also improve his customer service: “I use QuickBooks Online and Zapier to export information from filtered invoices to Evernote,” he explains. “Evernote allows me to track the thank-you cards we send to our clients after we finish work for them.” By keeping his apps harmonized, he ensures harmony with his customers, too. It’s a win-win for everybody. Here are some more of our favorite Zaps: Create Trello cards automatically from new Evernote notes (or vice versa) Write blog posts in Evernote and automatically publish them to WordPress or an RSS feed Streamline your reading list by connecting Evernote to Pocket or Instapaper Add starred Slack messages to a note For more ways Zapier can help you do more with Evernote, check out their list of integrations .", "date": "2018-01-11,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Addicted to Apps? Here’s How to Make it Work", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/addicted-apps-heres-make-work/", "abstract": "One of the comments we’ve heard from customers is that they want to be able to access their Evernote content from within their other digital tools. It makes sense. We recently partnered with data analytics firm YouGov for a U.S. survey, and found that 65 percent of workers use up to nine different apps every day. And now that Bring Your Own App (BYOA) is revolutionizing IT, it’s no surprise that customers expect the apps they love to work together seamlessly. But here’s the problem: When your apps don’t play well with each other, getting your work done can be… well, a lot of work. Different apps create information silos, where each tool only has part of what you need. So you struggle to stitch it all together, using emails, copy and paste, countless open tabs, and dozens of chat channels. And the result? You lose up to 40 percent of your most productive time jumping between apps to get things done. Integrations to the rescue Integrations are the bridges between your apps, allowing them to communicate with each other and share information. This exponentially increases the value of your data by helping you leverage it in new, creative ways. Over the years, Evernote has made productivity easier by building integrations with a host of powerful apps, including Microsoft Outlook, Salesforce, Google Drive, Slack, and many others. Now we’ve added another big name to that list. Microsoft Teams is the hub in Office 365 where teams can chat, share documents, have video meetings, and move projects forward. Evernote for Microsoft Teams brings your notes into the context of your Teams conversations, so you can access and reference specific notes—without having to leave the Teams experience. As businesses, Evernote and Microsoft share a common purpose: helping people work better together. And the best way we can honor that mission is by joining forces to help you achieve more. We believe in empowering our customers to use the tools they love, because tools and technology can boost productivity and help your team succeed. What does “playing well with others” mean to us? Check out our recent Q&A with Microsoft’s Mansoor Malik and our own Leo Gong to find out more.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Ever Better Challenge, Part 4: Consider the Past, Continue What Works", "author": ["Brian Daignault"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/ever-better-challenge-reflect-correct/", "abstract": "It’s been a long 21 days. I think giving up desserts for my Ever Better Challenge (Evernote’s 30-day program to help you finish what you start) was a decent idea, but it might have been an easier feat after the holidays. I never noticed how ubiquitous holiday desserts were until this year. Every day was an obstacle course—coworkers bringing baked goods to the office! Friends, neighbors, and relatives giving treats as gifts! Free samples at every store! Nevertheless, with the exception of the accidental cookie I mentioned in the second blog post in this series, and the genuine setback featured in week three , I’ve stuck to my challenge. I mentioned last week that setbacks are likely in any habit change, so I’m going to declare this a victory so far—although I still have a few days to go. As you enter the home stretch of your own challenge, this point right around Day 21 is a great opportunity to pause and take stock: What’s working? What isn’t? And why? Figuring that out now can help you power through to the finish line and keep your new habits going for the long term. Here’s what I found when I reflected on the past three weeks. Hopefully, it’ll help you finish what you started. What worked Having self-compassion I admit, up front, I haven’t done this challenge perfectly. Some days I didn’t even follow my own advice (so don’t beat yourself up if you didn’t either). I tend to be pretty hard on myself. It’s been interesting to notice how much of the advice I wrote in these blogs was actually directed inward. As I wrote in the last blog: “ It’s not uncommon for people to totally give up on a goal after a slip. We set these targets in a black and white way—this will be accomplished or it won’t—instead of recognizing that consistent effort leads to improvement.” The black-and-white thinking? Totally my style. The quitting over a single slip-up? Also my style. So it was a big deal for me to not beat myself up —it kept me moving forward even when I wanted to self-sabotage . Being honest There were some days I was in a pretty foul mood—and people noticed. I was the first person to test out this challenge and wanted it to go smoothly. But I couldn’t hide the fact that I was having a hard time. Admitting I was struggling was surprisingly liberating. I was letting myself be flawed and I was letting others know. Everyone responded with some variation of warmth and support, which gave me both the freedom to struggle and the strength to continue. Taking it one day at a time It was helpful to remember that I wasn’t committing to never eating dessert again—just for 30 days. On any given day, I only had to make it until bedtime without dessert to be successful. I stopped worrying about what would happen the next day, next week, or after the challenge. Rather than getting overwhelmed , I took it day by day. This kept me focused on the present, which was much easier to manage than the rest of my life all at once . As a result, my challenge stayed manageable and I abstained from dessert on a number of days I would have otherwise slipped into my old Habit Loop . What didn’t work My activation energy ran out In scientific terms, activation energy is the amount of energy it takes to create a chemical reaction. For our purposes, it’s how much energy is required to get a new habit going. Initially, I wanted to take the stairs every day for my challenge. That seemed like an easy way to lose a little weight. And it is; I’ve taken the stairs every day with no problem. Giving up dessert, on the other hand, took a lot of activation energy. After a few days, I was already burning out. OK, I was burning out on the first day—skipping dessert is much harder for me than taking the stairs. For years, I have followed nearly every meal with dessert—sometimes I’ll even skip a meal and just eat cupcakes, waffles, cookies, etc. I am hooked on sugar. Over the past few weeks, I’ve noticed how intense my craving for sweets is, and the effect they have on my mood: without them, I’m irritable (to put it lightly). This may be part of the reason I slipped on day 11—and it’s definitely why this challenge has been so difficult. My challenge was too hard There’s a sweet spot for success, no pun intended. If a challenge is too easy, it’s boring and not truly rewarding to overcome. If it’s too difficult, it’s overwhelming. James Clear refers to this as “ the Goldilocks Rule “. Taking the stairs was just barely a challenge. I only needed to focus on changing my behavior for a few days and the rest has come together. No desserts for 30 days might have been too hard. Perhaps having desserts, but only on the weekend, would have been better. Or, because it’s such a hard challenge, perhaps I could have planned better or reached out for help sooner…or at all. I didn’t reach out Sometimes asking for help is hard. That’s why we made the Support Network template: so you could anticipate when, why, and how you would be tempted—and what to do when the time came. While it might be easy to write down whom to call when you’re on the edge of giving up, it’s much harder to actually follow through—not only do you have to be humble, you also have to be ready to keep going. How I corrected myself to finish On day 12 of my challenge, after having slipped the night before, I came into work disheartened. I was ready to give up. The things I wrote at work were really negative (almost comically so in retrospect) and I was cursing this whole process. It occurred to me that I could give up and still write these last few blog posts. I could lie to you and my coworkers and say everything was going great…but I couldn’t lie to myself. Day 12 was “gut check” time: did I have what it takes to finish this challenge, or not? I decided I did. But how? I used my templates Returning to the templates I began with helped me re-energize and re-focus. I checked in with my Build a Plan template to remember my motivation. I put my Habit Tracker in a more prominent place. I looked over my Support Network template and reached out to some people to let them know what happened. And I wrote a lot of notes in my Reflect & Correct template. I kept going Once I made the decision to not give up and checked in with my templates (and support network) it became much easier to keep going. The last 10 days have gone by without too much emotion. I remembered how disappointed I felt when I ate those cookies and didn’t want that to be the end of my story. Even if it wouldn’t be perfect, I decided I wanted to finish what I started. You can keep going, too If you’re struggling, I urge you to keep going. Check-in with our Facebook group and reach out to your support network. Remember why you chose to take on this challenge: you wanted to be someone different. And to be someone you’ve never been, you have to do things you’ve never done. Whatever your challenge is, overcoming it will empower you to have confidence in taking on more and greater challenges in the future. The only person you have to compare yourself to is who you were yesterday—so here’s to being Ever Better!", "date": "2019-01-21,"},

Today is day 28 of my Ever Better Challenge , which is no desserts for 30 days in the hope of losing a little weight. I recognize that skipping dessert is easy for some people, but I’m not one of them. It’s much easier for me to skip meals and go straight to the good stuff than it is to turn down something sweet. I’m happy (and surprised) to report that, over the past four weeks, my desire to consume sugar has plummeted. What happened? I hacked my habit loop . The habit loop is broken into four parts: cue, craving, response, and reward. Throughout my challenge, I have avoided some cues (skip the snack aisle), changed my response (eat fruit), and substituted my reward (dopamine from exercise instead of sugar). As a result, my cravings have steadily receded to the point where I’ve mostly lost interest in eating desserts. I wasn’t perfect I began this challenge with a lot of confidence but, as you may recall from week three , I had a few setbacks along the way. One of them was accidental…and one of them was very intentional. Even though I filled out my templates—I built a plan and created a Support Network —I drifted away from using them for a while. I skipped a bunch of days on my Habit Tracker , for instance. I haven’t been perfect, but setbacks are somewhat inevitable. Instead of giving up, I was able to fail forward and keep going with the help of my Reflect & Correct template (and by making sure to use the others). I’ve been successful I have eaten desserts on a daily basis for years. During this challenge, even with my slips, I’ve eaten less sugar in the past few weeks than at any other point in my life. It’s easy for me to fall into all-or-nothing thinking, but it’s also easy to recognize that my challenge has been a success. Painfully difficult to maintain on some days, but a victory nonetheless: I changed one habit and have met my goal of losing a few pounds. Our friends have been successful, too We designed this challenge with the hope of helping people visualize who they wanted to be—who they could be—and work on changing one habit that would move them closer to that reality. As we approach the 30-day mark, I asked some of my fellow challengers how they were doing. I found their replies inspiring and thought you might as well: My 30-day challenge of quitting smoking has been tough, but keeping track of my goal has kept me focused and made the process so much easier. I successfully dropped from 30 cigarettes a day to none in five days. I have not smoked a single cigarette in 15 consecutive days now. – John H. I set a target of writing 600 words a day. I’ve fallen short at times, but have come back to it the next day. – Saikat B. My habit has changed from unconsciously binge eating at night to questioning if I’m really hungry. I’m thinking first instead of being impulsive. As far as I’m concerned that’s success – Sinda A. As I get to day 30 of not adding cash to my Starbucks card, I’m now spending my coffee money on fresh groceries. I’m not just saving money, but also enjoying the benefit of using it better. – Ellen G. My Ever Better Challenge has been to meditate every day for at least 15 minutes. I’ve had a couple of slips along the way—especially on the weekends—but I’ve found that following a (mostly) regular practice has helped me feel calmer and more focused overall. – Anthony B. Wow, everyone did great…right? Not everyone responds to the same challenge in the same way. This has been a learning experience for everyone—including us at Evernote. But this challenge isn’t about perfection; it’s about being Ever Better—if only for a day. And by that definition, everyone was a success (even if they didn’t always think so). Keeping up with my challenge has been hard. It got a little easier each day, but sometimes I had extra work, unexpected incidents or a rough night that got in the way. – Mariano G. It was difficult to commit at the top of the year when everything else felt like a priority too, but the challenge element helped. – Monica L. My challenge has been a pretty epic failure. Life kept getting in the way. – Melissa G. Shoot! Did I miss the boat on the challenge? – Lawrence C. What about Forrest? You know Forrest as the guy from our Ever Better Challenge videos . He’s been representing our challenge to the world by sharing his ups and downs over the past few weeks—but we haven’t heard from him in a while. Here’s how his challenge is wrapping up: I love to write fiction, but I’ve never been able to build a consistent writing habit that will allow me to grow and improve as a storyteller. My challenge didn’t go well at first, but it turned out that all I had to do was start protecting my time and loosen up in my intentions. I realized that the point isn’t to “finish story X in 30 days.” It’s to spend a little time each day doing something I love. With that in mind, when I sit down to write, I find it a little easier to get into the groove. – Forrest B. Some advice, in closing We worked with a few social media influencers who helped us spread the word while also going through the challenge themselves. I asked them for the advice they would give to people just getting started. Here’s what they had to say: Celebrate the small victories. Use your missteps as learning opportunities, guidelines to help you reassess your goals or methods of achieving them. Christine Ha , chef & owner of The Blind Goat in Houston, TX. Do it! Even if you’re not sure what your goal is just yet. You’ll learn about yourself as you make your way through. – Dhariana Lozano , social media consultant Please take small, small, tiny bites to victory. We want so badly to tell people that we did impossible-sounding things on impossible timelines. That is a straight-up recipe for disappointment. – Berna Anat , “personal finance hype woman” Keep your big vision at the forefront, and each day remind yourself WHY you’re doing this. Some days you’ll lose momentum, but that’s OK—just keep going. – Tim Lampe , art director Having a timeline to complete a goal makes you accountable—and as you progress, you realize how capable you actually are. – Monica Leed , professional organizer Epilogue Due to the nature of publishing, I had to go through my challenge a week or so ahead of schedule. As a result, I’m able to squeeze in a final report to tell you that… I’m finished! I didn’t have any desserts after my setback on day 21 and wrapped up with 28 dessert-free days. The day after My challenge was no desserts for 30 days, not for the rest of my life , and I was very excited to finish so I could gorge on desserts as soon as it was over. The day after my challenge ended, I headed to the local frozen yogurt shop to load up on my usual topping-covered jumbo cup of coconut froyo. But, as excited as I was, the yogurt wasn’t that good—it mostly tasted like cold, wet sugar. And later that day, I had a few more of the cookies I mentioned in the third blog —but they also just tasted like sugar. I was expecting to experience the pure joy these desserts consistently brought me in the past, but that’s not what happened. Instead, each bite tasted disgustingly sweet. As I kept snacking, hoping to enjoy it sooner or later, I could feel my face flush and my stomach slightly turn. I also noticed an uncomfortable burst of energy followed later by a sleepy crash. My dessert homecoming was an almost entirely unpleasant experience. Ever Better Since that frenzy on day 31, I haven’t eaten much sugar. It seems that I gained some distance from desserts during my challenge and, in that time, they became…distasteful. When I think back on the past weeks, I’m amazed by how perfectly the arc of my habit change fit with this challenge. Perhaps it was just coincidence or my subconscious following a set of deadlines. Whatever it was, now that it’s over one thing is clear: I finished what I started. And so can you.", "date": "2019-01-28,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Ever Better Challenge, Part 3: Overcome Setbacks, Finish What You Started", "author": ["Brian Daignault"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/ever-better-challenge-setbacks/", "abstract": "So, about that cookie I mentioned in last week’s blog … It was an accident. Sometimes setbacks are. Like when you want to start running every day, but you sprain your ankle. Or when you commit to an Ever Better Challenge to stop eating desserts, but a tray of warm chocolate chip cookies is placed in front of you at your office’s holiday party—and you instinctively grab one and take a bite. Taking the cookie was a great example of my habit loop in action. As soon as the tray was set down, my brain went into automatic processing mode—EAT THAT NOW—despite spending much of my day focused on this challenge and being surrounded by coworkers aware of my situation. I realized what I’d done while I was chewing. When my coworkers noticed, they laughed and that was that; no beating myself up or feeling disappointed. It was a simple mistake on day four of my challenge. But… A week later was different. Day 11 of my challenge was rough. I had heard some bad news and was feeling bummed out. I got home from work and was craving sugar. Not surprising , since eating—particularly “junk” food—is a common way to deal with negative emotions. There were some cookies in the snack cabinet, and even though I knew I wasn’t “supposed” to eat one, I did. Then I ate a few more. And then I felt disappointed and discouraged. I had done a lot of research on habits. I’d filled out my templates and built a support network. I knew better than to give in to my craving, but I did it anyway. Setbacks aren’t surprises Setbacks are to be expected . When I started my challenge, I knew that “Deal with Setbacks” was the topic for this blog and wondered what I would write about since I—of course—wouldn’t have one. Then the accidental cookie happened, and I felt relieved; now I had material. I wasn’t expecting to have a true moment of weakness at all, let alone so soon. Maybe you’ve had a setback by now as well. If so, here’s what can you do next to make sure you stay on track and finish what you’ve started: Acknowledge setbacks—compassionately Setbacks happen. We’re not perfect— nobody is. The pressure we apply to ourselves to be flawless is not only unrealistic, it’s also dangerous. Failing forward is part of growth. It’s only a big deal to have eaten the cookie because I decided to change my behavior. Rather than focus on a slip, it’s better to focus on the other days without one. Success is not always a straight line , but rather one of ups and downs that gradually leads to a positive change. Take responsibility After a setback is a good time to check-in and understand why and how it occurred. Eating the cookies was a willful decision. I knew the consequences, I knew there were alternatives, but that didn’t stop m e. It’s best to own that choice without judgment. Beating ourselves up over a setback doesn’t help. The most effective approach is to accept what happened and consider what could have been done differently—and do it next time temptation strikes. For example, I could have called my support network or done the pushups I mentioned in last week’s blog. While these actions may not have replaced the craving, they would have likely been a distraction until it passed. Talk about it Even though I didn’t reach out to my network before eating cookies, I did afterward. Not only to be honest and accountable about my decision but also to be vulnerable in a way that will make it easier to reach out the next time I’m struggling. Being honest with another person about a slip lets everyone (especially ourselves) know that we’re willing to ask for—and receive—help. Don’t use a setback as an excuse to quit It’s not uncommon for people to totally give up on a goal after a slip. We set these targets in a black-and-white way—this will be accomplished or it won’t—instead of recognizing that consistent effort leads to improvement. A slip isn’t the end, it’s a bump in the road. All-or-nothing thinking is usually dangerous. It can lead us to negative self-talk and giving up entirely — instead of remembering that setbacks can be learning experiences that lead to growth. Remember your motivation I felt guilt and shame after succumbing to my craving for sugar. That’s because I want to change my behavior and, at that moment, I regressed. I want to lose weight by not eating dessert. But it’s easy to succumb to a craving in a moment of weakness . Short-term rewards provide instant gratification , especially in times of stress or struggle. The discipline to resist those cravings is essential for success. Revisit your Build a Plan template and remember your motivation and the strategy you created to accomplish your goal. Get back up Because of my slips, I won’t be able to say I went 30 days without dessert—but I can still make it 28 days. And that’s 28 days of breaking a habit, making different choices, and proving to myself that I can do this—all of which build confidence that will be helpful as I take on other challenges. If you’ve had a setback, it’s especially important to accept it and move on; stay focused on your goal, not the bumps along the way. Instead of getting stuck, get stronger . Keep checking the boxes A few days without an “X” on your Habit Tracker template doesn’t mean you failed. Use those days to enter notes about what happened and why, and remember there are still a lot of days before and after a setback to feel good about. Let people in Reaching out to the people on your Support Network template can lead to acceptance, guidance, and…support. As you go through your challenge, keep in mind that people want to help you be better. I genuinely thought I wouldn’t need any help because this would be so easy. It’s been humbling to realize I am not as disciplined as I thought I was, but it’s also been a positive experience that has brought me closer to others. Reflect and Correct The lessons you’re learning through this challenge will be useful in the future. The notes from your Habit Tracker can also be used for the Reflect and Correct template. One of the benefits of writing all this down is that it’s preserved for posterity. In the future, I can look at this template and remember the night I ate the cookies—how I felt (before and after) and what I could have done differently. I’ll share more of that information in next week’s blog as I wrap up my challenge. Understanding how this one went—what worked and what didn’t—will help set me up for success going forward.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Ever Better Challenge, Part 2: Maintain the Change, Get Closer to Your Goal", "author": ["Brian Daignault"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/ever-better-challenge-maintain-momentum/", "abstract": "I’m grumpy. People are starting to ask me if I’m OK. I politely tell them I’m fine, but the truth is I’m craving desserts. It feels like something is missing. I don’t want to get too existential, but life has felt a little empty over the last week. It’s been about seven days since I stopped eating dessert for my Ever Better Challenge . So far, I have lost a pound or two and am finding I sleep a little better. I feel good about these changes—but I really, really want some frozen yogurt. Hopefully, you’re doing great and soaring into the second week of your challenge. But maybe you’re having an experience similar to mine and are struggling. Changing a habit is tough I was pretty excited to get started on this challenge. I had done the research and was prepared with the facts. I was confident that these blogs would be a journal of triumph. That was last week. The truth is it’s harder to skip the Monday morning chocolate-hazelnut croissant this week. I am realizing I love desserts more than I thought—or that my habit of consuming them is stronger than I thought. Habits can be broken It’s possible that giving up desserts is so hard because I’m hooked on sugar. There’s evidence that sugar is addictive, and that not only is my mood impacted by removing it from my diet, but my physiology is as well. But behavior is at the root of that possible addiction, and while years of wiring my brain and body for eating desserts may make it harder to quit eating them, it’s just a habit— and habits can be broken . The habit loop I just finished lunch and am craving sugar. As I mentioned in last week’s blog , I’ve followed meals with desserts for years. As a result, finishing a meal is a cue for my habit. Cues are part one of the habit loop; they initiate a craving (part two) that leads to performing a routine (part three) in order to enjoy a reward (part four). For me, the reward is the dopamine my brain releases in response to sugar. Dopamine is pretty great stuff that compels people to do unhealthy things—even when they know better. I know sugar isn’t good for me, but that doesn’t stop me from raiding the snack cabinet after dinner at home or searching for nearby frozen yogurt options after a meal at a restaurant. Hacking the habit loop In order to break free from the compulsion to eat desserts, I have to change something in my habit loop . I’m wired to want sugar, but for now, I can at least avoid the cue of a snack cabinet or frozen yogurt shop to reduce the craving. The routine is where I can make the most effective change. Before I started this challenge, I thought that maybe munching on carrots after meals would satisfy my craving. Nope—there’s no dopamine in eating carrots. Since I’m wired to want dopamine, I have to find a way to change my routine and still get it somehow. Exercise works, and it serves my goal of losing weight. As I head into week three, I’m going to try doing some pushups every time I want sugar. I’ll let you know how it goes. Don’t give up now Changing habits is inherently difficult . Otherwise, we wouldn’t have any bad habits at all. But we’ve made it this far and there are ways to maintain that momentum: Recognize progress — Rather than focus on how many days you have left in the challenge, celebrate how many days you’ve stuck to your goal. Stay in the moment — You can only do this challenge one day at a time. You don’t have to worry about the future, you only have to think about today. Have patience and self-compassion — Habits take a long time to build, and will take a long time to overcome. Be kind to yourself along the way. Focus on the rewards — It can be easy to get bogged down in the emotions associated with changing a habit. Consider every decision you make toward your goal as a victory and celebrate your progress. With each step, you come closer to your goal and grow the confidence to take on whatever is next. Remember to use the four Ever Better Challenge templates: Build a Plan — Keep this template handy to stay focused on your goal, motivation, and steps to success—especially if you find yourself struggling a bit. Habit Tracker — Use this template to keep tabs on your progress; it feels good to tick off each day’s box. You can also make notes in this template—I’m writing about how and when I feel tempted. It turns out walking by the neighborhood bakery causes me to want dessert, so I’ve picked a new route to get home from work. By taking notes, you might also discover things you could do to help yourself succeed. Support Network — Use this template to make sure you’re getting the help you need as you go through your challenge. I’ve noticed I’m not using my Support Network template to reach out to people as often as I could. When I began this challenge, I let my team at work and a few of my friends know what was going on. Everyone has been supportive when I’ve brought up the challenge, but I haven’t really been letting them know how hard it is. Next week, when I get frustrated, I’m going to tell someone how I’m feeling. Reflect & Correct — Hopefully, you saved and filled in what you could of all four templates before starting your challenge . I did, and this week I’m writing down some reflections on how difficult going cold turkey on desserts is, and how my future challenges could be made more effective by being more reasonable. I’m also correcting myself a bit. I’ve decided that it’s OK to have a healthy cereal or granola bar when craving sugar. This template is a great place to journal on how things are going—for now, and for later. Try to incorporate your daily Habit Tracker notes for a more complete understanding of your experience. Maintain your momentum On the rough days, remember that consistent effort is all you really need to change a habit. You don’t have to be perfect, you just have to make progress. At the end of week two, you’ll be halfway through the challenge. Focus on your goal and keep up the good work. Oh, and one last thing… Last Thursday, my team had a holiday party at a restaurant downtown. A tray of warm chocolate cookies was brought out and placed next to me. Without thinking, I grabbed one and devoured it, not realizing what I was doing until I noticed the looks on my coworkers’ faces. It was a genuine (and delicious) accident. But it was also a setback…more on that in next week’s blog. Until then, be sure to share your story with the Ever Better Challenge Facebook group .", "date": "2019-01-7,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Plan a Family Vacation Without Losing Your Mind", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/plan-family-vacation-without-losing-mind/", "abstract": "Think about the last time your family took a vacation together. What image comes to mind? Natural wonders? Perfect sunsets? Or the frustration of trying to deal with hotels and wrangle the kids and get something—anything—to go as planned? The family vacation is a rite of passage for many families. It’s inspired countless movies and books ( National Lampoon’s Vacation , anyone?). It’s the sort of thing that can strike fear into the hearts of parents—and total boredom into the hearts of their children. But with the right preparation, it is possible for the whole family to have fun, creating wonderful memories that will last a lifetime. A successful family getaway doesn’t happen by accident, though. It takes a sense of humor, a willingness to be flexible—and plenty of planning. And while “the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry,” at least you can be ready when things go off the rails. There’s no better time than today According to new research from TSheets by QuickBooks , 65 percent of U.S. workers didn’t take all their allowed time off last year. At the same time, 43 percent of participants reported that they “often” or “always” feel stressed. We’re prepared to bet those two numbers are related. Our advice? Take that vacation. Get away and recharge your batteries. You’ll come back to work feeling rested and ready to take on the world. And your family will appreciate seeing a happier, more relaxed you . That doesn’t mean you need to go it alone, though. A family vacation can be one of the most enjoyable experiences of your life. But—and here’s the important part—if you’re traveling with kids, you need to have a plan. Backpacking across Asia might be an exciting adventure when it’s just you (and maybe a friend or two), but flying by the seat of your pants simply isn’t practical when you have a family. For advice on how to get it done, we asked a few of our resident experts on vacation planning (and parenting ) to share their favorite tips on how you can create an amazing trip for the entire family—right now. 1. Keep everything in one place “The question from our kids is always ‘What are we doing tomorrow?’ I didn’t have to worry about that because I already had the research done.” Jish Mukerji OK, you’ve decided to take that vacation. Now it’s time to get down to the nitty-gritty of planning and booking your trip. Laying the groundwork now will eliminate a host of problems down the road. So a crucial early step is to create a vacation notebook in Evernote, where you can keep track of all the details that could make or break your trip. Product Marketing Manager Jish Mukerji took his family on a long-awaited vacation to Walt Disney World in Florida in April 2018, and planned the whole thing in Evernote. Jish says, “With theme parks, there are a lot of articles about strategies for avoiding long wait times for attractions. All that info helps you plot your day out—what to see first, what to leave until the end of the day—so I captured it all and built a schedule for us in Evernote.” In the months before you travel, your travel notebook will be the hub for all your vacation research. As you come across websites with lists of ‘must-see’ attractions, or advice on local customs, clip them into Evernote . Looking through a physical magazine? Snap a photo or scan an article, then save it to your notebook. Over time, your vacation notebook will continue to expand as you include confirmations of airline flights, hotel reservations, rental cars, and more. Share the notebook with your partner so they can add their own research to yours. When you’re finally on vacation, knowing where you need to be, and when, can relieve a great deal of the stress you and your kids may feel being far from home. Jish says, “You get so exhausted at the end of these days and the question from our kids is always ‘What are we doing tomorrow?’ I didn’t have to worry about that because I already had the research done. It helped us have a little more peace of mind.” 2. Have a Plan A (and a Plan B and Plan C) “I planned mornings and afternoons, and then depending on whether the kids were sick or jet-lagged, we mixed and matched.” Nancy Fu Magee Let’s be honest: traveling with small children can be challenging. Even the most well-behaved kids will generally run out of patience long before their parents. Add jet lag and sleep deprivation into the mix and you have a recipe for disaster. No matter how well-thought-out your itinerary is, it’s important to be flexible and open to change. Perhaps you’ve planned a walk through a gorgeous local park, only to wake up in the morning to pouring rain. Instead of sitting around your hotel room waiting for the weather to clear—while your kids become increasingly restless—be ready to shift gears by having alternate activities that you can enjoy instead. Director of Product Nancy Fu Magee traveled to Europe in 2015 with her children aged one and three, and the family had such a successful trip that they decided to tackle Hawaii the following year. The key, according to Nancy, lies in being flexible and understanding how little minds work. She says, “We tried to stay in each place at least three days so the kids would get used to ‘their’ room with ‘their’ toys and didn’t feel so overwhelmed with all the new locations.” Even when the weather behaves, circumstances beyond your control (i.e., kids) can cause you to change plans. Nancy was prepared for that too. “I planned mornings and afternoons, and then depending on whether the kids were sick or jet-lagged, we mixed and matched.” For Jish, having a plan with flexibility built in was a game changer. “Our itinerary evolved in the middle of the trip when we saw weather conditions change. We just said ‘OK, let’s move our indoor day to this bad weather day.’” 3. Get the whole family involved Nancy Fu Magee’s visual calendar “If your kids are helping you cook a meal, they’ll eat it.” Jish Mukerji There are a lot of moving parts to planning a great vacation, but that doesn’t mean your younger family members can’t be involved in their own way. While he was preparing for their trip, Jish made sure that his 10-year-old twin daughters had a chance to review the itinerary and suggest possible destinations. “If your kids are old enough to have some participation—whether it’s editing a note or voting on an activity—then they’ll enjoy the day more,” he says. “It’s almost like they’re sharing this great thing with you that they found.” Even if your kids are too young to take an active role, you can still make them a part of the action—instead of thinking of them as ‘luggage that eats.’ Nancy says, “Each day when it was time to decide what to do, I showed the kids these notes I made about each district, with pictures and not just words, so we could discuss what they were excited about doing that day.” Before taking her family to Hawaii, Nancy created a visual itinerary for her then-four-year-old daughter, using a picture to represent each day. “She wanted to know what we were doing on which days but she couldn’t read yet. So we made this visual calendar together so she could get excited about the trip. This is one of my favorite memories of ‘Things I Did With My Daughter.’” Although Jish had final approval over the specifics, he was carefully to make sure his kids had some ‘skin in the game.’ “Even if I’d already chosen the hotel, I’d show them a picture and say ‘What do you think of this place? OK, I’ll book that,’” he says. “If your kids are helping you cook a meal, they’ll eat it.” 4. Make the most of templates “Your vacation shouldn’t just be about the kids. Find something that you’ll enjoy doing too.” SiNing Chan Once you’ve researched your destination and decided what you want to see and do, the next step is creating a detailed itinerary. This is where you begin to put the pieces in place and see what is actually possible in the time you have available. Just like at home, aim for a mix of activities and down time when planning a vacation with the kids. Too many activities and they’ll become exhausted and cranky; too few and they’ll be bored and… well, cranky. The perfect balance is much easier to achieve, though, when you can see each day laid out clearly in front of you. When it comes time to make your itinerary, templates in Evernote are your best friend. Instead of reinventing the wheel, templates come ready-made for you to fill with information. We teamed up with Barbara Fuller from Simplify Days to create a few vacation-themed templates to help you on your way: Travel Calendar Template Travel Daily Itinerary Template Trip Planning Template Travel Inspiration Template To use them, simply click “Save to Evernote,” then replace the provided information with your own. You can easily add links to local websites or other notes in your vacation notebook. Save important details like flight numbers and hotel addresses right there in your itinerary so you know exactly where to find them. One thing to consider: If you’re still in the ‘dreaming’ stage of planning, using our Travel Inspiration Template as a guide, don’t focus solely on what the kids will enjoy. After all, this is your vacation too. As Senior Instructional Designer SiNing Chan says, “Your vacation shouldn’t just be about the kids. Find something that you’ll enjoy doing too.” Perhaps that means alternating a day at a theme park with a day at a museum. Either way, the perfect vacation plan has a mix of activities that will appeal to everyone. 5. Remember everything SiNing says “If you’re anything like me, you think a vacation is never long enough. But I’ve learned to cope with this by developing some ways to combat the post-holiday blues.” Her favorite piece of advice? Use Evernote to create a digital scrapbook of your trip. Create a note in Evernote for each stop on your vacation, and fill it with pictures of the location, together with any souvenirs, like ticket stubs, brochures, etc. In each note, record audio of your kids describing what they’re seeing, and their reactions to it. Those delightful childish voices will bring a smile to your face when you listen back to them in the years to come. SiNing also suggests arming your kids with a cheap digital camera and letting them take their own pictures. Then you can add them to your notes for another unique perspective on your vacation. Sure, you’ll probably get a lot of shots of the ground, or a finger over the lens, but you will also be amazed and surprised by what your budding shutterbugs consider photo worthy. Finally, when you return home, set aside an evening for a fun family “slideshow.” Cook up a batch of popcorn and make use of Evernote’s Presentation Mode to look back on all the pictures from your vacation. Discuss your individual memories of the trip, and each person’s favorite moments. Organizing a vacation for the whole family takes effort. But don’t let that scare you off the idea. With proper planning, and the right attitude, you can create an experience that you and your kids will remember fondly, and that you’ll still be talking about for years to come. And for the final word on the subject, here’s Nancy: “I love traveling with kids! People should be less afraid of it.”", "date": "2018-05-24,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Introducing Templates, A Better Way to Make Notes", "author": ["Jason Sophian"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/introducing-templates/", "abstract": "Getting your thoughts out of your head is the first step to organizing them and turning them into action. That’s what Evernote is all about. But not all notes are created equal. Look at your own collection of notes and you’ll probably find some that are carefully structured, and others that are a stream of consciousness. There’s nothing wrong with winging it, of course, but if you want to gain clarity in your thinking, sometimes it helps to begin with a clean, organized structure. Then you can take things one step at a time and focus only on what you need to consider, without distractions. That’s where templates come in. For years we’ve recommended creating new notes from standardized templates as a way to get more done in less time, and offered up dozens of samples you can use for everything from planning meetings to the GTD® organizing method to writing a novel. Those templates have proven wildly popular, but you told us you wanted something more.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Cool Tricks from One of Brazil’s Evernote Experts", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/cool-tricks-from-vladimir-campos/", "abstract": "Evernote fans are a passionate bunch. But then there’s Vladimir Campos, an Evernote enthusiast in Brazil who turned his affection for organizing notes into a full-time job. As an Evernote Certified Consultant , V l a d helps entrepreneurs make the leap to organizing paperless offices.  On top of that, he has a popular YouTube channel to teach Evernote tips and tricks to the public. He also hosts a weekly Evernote-themed podcast, called An Elephant’s Journal, and he’s the author of Organizando a vida com o Evernote , (Organizing Your Life With Evernote), a best-selling book in Brazil. Some of the tips he offers his listeners and readers may already be familiar to long-time Evernote fans, but to those just starting out, Vlad’s recommendations are a revelation. One of his favorites is a simple naming convention that helps him remember which notebooks to send emails to. “I can email directly to a notebook, but I have to remember the name of the notebook to do it,” he says. “So I keep the notebook names as simple as possible. One word. This is especially good for companies, where many people are emailing information into the same notebook. I keep notebooks called ‘Health,’ “Clients’, ‘Public,’ and so forth. I don’t have to remember so many notebook names.” Learn how to send emails into specific notebooks in Evernote >>> On the Road to Paperless Vladimir has a simple strategy for building his business—giving his knowledge away for free. That’s the model behind his podcast and videos, which leads to both consulting jobs from business customers and increased book sales. “Business clients come to me when they realize they can’t find things, and they know things are not working,” Vlad says. “Realizing they need help is often the hardest part of the journey.” Once Vlad starts with a new client, he starts by figuring out how best to integrate Evernote into the company’s existing workflow. Or, if the company doesn’t have one, he collaborates with his clients to build a workflow for them. “I let the clients do most of the work because they have to learn how to do it on their own,” Vlad explains. While he works with management, he makes sure that all team members take his online course, Evernote for Beginners. The goal is to make his business teams as paperless as possible. Vladimir Campos “I’m not against paper,” Vlad is quick to point out. “It’s just that it’s harder to find information that way. It’s so much easier to have things stored electronically and then do a search from wherever you are. That’s what I teach my clients.” “I’m not against paper. It’s just that it’s harder to find information that way.” —Vladimir Campos Tag, you’re organized Before Vlad comes along, the businesses he helps often find themselves repeating tasks needlessly, lost in the paper trail. “If you have several calls with the same customer, and they talk to different employees, sometimes it’s hard to find records of the previous calls. So often, the information is scattered. If you have one shared notebook, and everybody’s working in it, everyone can see the information and pick up where they last left off.” Vlad describes a scenario in which each client has a notebook, and everyone who deals with that client adds to it. “Set up a simple system of tags, and after each contact, tag the notebook with the stage of the sales process each client is in,” he says. “Then everyone will be in the loop all the time.” Vlad notes that many of his clients are surprised how quickly they can find the document they need, even if their new system hosts over 10,000 items. Build a tagging structure that works for your company>>> The keys to a finely tuned search Though his business clients are often newcomers to Evernote, Vlad sometimes uses his blog and podcast to geek out over more advanced Evernote features. His favorite trick involves search syntax. “These are words you can use to create a more powerful search combining different needs in one, Vlad enthuses. And if you want to exclude certain items like tags, just use the minus symbol (-).” An example of Vlad’s syntax formula might look like this: notebook:Health -tag:appointment. That would open all the notes in the notebook you’ve named “Health” except for the ones tagged appointment. It sorts through notes for you and helps you find what you need faster. “This syntax isn’t limited to two items, as this example shows,” Vlad advises. “The beauty of it is that you can combine as many parameters as you like.”. Vlad uses variations of this trick for his own life. “Once you set this search syntax, you can save it to your shortcuts so you can use it again,” he says. “For example, I travel a lot. I set up a rule in Gmail to automatically send travel-related email to my default notebook, called ‘Archive.’ In Evernote, I saved a search for the word “ticket” in the Archive notebook minus the tag ‘done,’ like this: notebook:Archive ticket -tag:done. I use the minus sign to filter out the word “done” so that I don’t see trips I’ve already taken. That will bring up the tickets for all my upcoming trips, all in one click.” When Vlad returns from a trip, he tags the notes from the trip “done” so he can filter his completed trips in or out of future searches. Learn more about Evernote’s advanced search syntax >> Producing vast amounts of content for a blog, a book, a podcast, and his increasingly popular live workshops calls for a constant influx of new ideas. Vladimir says that ideas come to him just by going about his daily life, solving productivity problems for his clients or promoting his work. He often says that a successful business means to “change or die,” so he now looks to gain more knowledge about human behavior and machine learning.The more he knows, the more he can teach, but from new editions of his book, more podcasts, and a growing calendar of live workshop dates, he knows that Evernote will be at the heart of it all.

You need an information hub “With so many platforms and far-flung clouds, it’s no wonder a lot of important information slips through the cracks,” Bill says. “One of my clients was missing out on new business because sales information was scattered all over the place. In this case, the sales team was spending an enormous amount of time ‘hunting things down’ which gets even worse when you don’t even know what you’re looking for. I introduced them to Evernote Business and in a few weeks, all the tasks, workflow, and background information was in one place and instantly searchable.” That means less time spent on overhead and more time making progress. “No doubt, you can store files in a million different places, but when you put stuff in Evernote you can actually use it.” 2. Keep your goals in focus “Very often when I sit down with a new client there is no shortage of ambition. I wouldn’t be there if there wasn’t a destination,” says Bill. “It could be sales growth, lowering costs, opening 10 more stores, hiring new people… there are always goals. Which is great. That means the business has the energy and the desire to move forward. What often happens is that goals tend to drown in a sea of details. When what has to get done today is in the way of where you want to be tomorrow, you have a problem.” Bill finds that Evernote takes care of this in a number of ways: “First, the everyday stuff will be better managed and less stressful. When people have a strong understanding of what is expected of them, the daily chaos factor is greatly reduced. Key individuals might actually have a few minutes each day to look ahead, instead of putting out fires.” Second, making sure that goals have a place to live makes them more likely to become a reality. ”Goals are written down, agreed upon, and not messed with,” Bill says. “The ordinary bumps in the road cannot get in the way of a notebook called ‘Goals’. No matter how crazy things get, everyone can always refer back to the big picture and ask ‘what are we trying to do here?’ Ignorance of the goals is no longer an excuse!” 3. Treat Evernote like a colleague Bill also recommends treating shared information as part and parcel of how your team operates. “Evernote is on your desktop as an app. It’s on a web page if you’re away from your office. And it’s mobile,” he says.“The smartphone app is a full-featured beauty. And they all stay in sync. How’s that for simple. Anything you add or edit is available everywhere, instantly. For you privately or for your whole team. Your choice. When my clients start to think of Evernote almost like a colleague, or a staff member, things change. There’s a little more calm and lot more stability in an office powered by Evernote.” Take the next step If you’ve been thinking about bringing Evernote into your business but don’t have enough time for a deep dive, get in touch with an Evernote Certified Consultant .

The company primarily advises emerging growth tech, data, and media companies on mergers and acquisitions transactions. Progress Partners’ heavily process-driven approach is designed to set up choice for management teams and their shareholders while allowing clients to focus on execution and running the business. To make sure this happens, Progress Partners turns to Evernote. As company Vice President Davis Rosborough points out, “we live and die by it.” “Everything starts with Evernote; it’s a launchpad for all content—past, present, and future.” “You might say Evernote is the most valuable tool in our arsenal,” Davis explains. With over 22,000 notes created in Evernote since 2010, his team has turned Evernote into a “corpus of understanding” that covers interactions with clients, buyers, prospects, and industry influencers. It also provides everyone in the company with a real-time understanding of what’s important, what’s critical, and—as a historical record—allows better thinking for what’s next on the horizon. Initially, Progress Partners used Salesforce for tracking contacts and logging client activities. They began using Evernote after realizing it was a more helpful service for capturing detailed notes of meetings and conversations. According to Davis, the switch led to “a huge value increase,” by creating “a kind of living, breathing, working memory for the firm’s activity in the market.” “Everything starts with Evernote.” “Everything starts with Evernote;” Davis adds, “it’s a launchpad for all content—past, present, and future.” When Progress Partners is preparing an investment case or corporate deck, the team uses Evernote as a scrapbook for building ideas and organizing their thinking. Documents related to investment data rooms are all stored in Evernote. Progress Partners also uses Evernote to plan Progress Connect, its annual invite-only investment banking summit event. This summit gathers over four hundred executives in Boston each October to discuss the future of technology and how it will change every industry. Evernote also enables an intuitive onboarding process for new hires at Progress Partners. Davis even integrated IndustryMaps, a software visualization platform he developed with his colleagues to track a company’s competitive dynamics in each sector, with Evernote. Evernote also helps the company stay focused on goals amidst the day’s inevitable distractions. By building to-do lists, writing weekly goals, and tracking items to follow up on, the Progress Partners staff keeps the team accountable and concentrated on target accomplishments for any day and week. At every step of the way, Evernote is there. Evernote helps make it easy Davis believes Evernote’s ability to store and organize information helps make Progress Partners exceptional at what they do. Every contact the firm has ever had with another company can be easily searched and accessed in Evernote, allowing them to uncover detailed data and reduce duplicative efforts. The critical information collected from clients, CEOs, and lawyers can also be used to tell the customer stories crucial to Progress Partners’ success as mergers and acquisitions advisors. Using Evernote, Progress Partners can easily demonstrate knowledge about their industry and clients. And their ability to synthesize information from different domains builds client confidence. Progress Partners is advancing toward their goal of becoming an elite investment bank. “We are ‘right-sized for dedication’ as a client once put it, but see ourselves as ‘cottage industry investment bankers,’” states Davis. Evernote is helping them by making it easy to share knowledge, craft client stories, and integrate industry information in efficient ways that serve their clients’ unique needs.", "date": "2018-10-23,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Smarter Communication: The Key to Remote Team Success", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/smarter-communication-remote-team-success/", "abstract": "By Forrest Dylan Bryant One of the benefits of our device-centric, always connected world is that people can do their work from literally anywhere. Freed from the constraints of the office, more and more folks are getting things done from temporary spaces, out in the field, or even at home. But, like everything else in modern business, there are real challenges that come along with that freedom. How do we set a remote team up for success? What expectations should we set? How can remote teams keep projects under control? What qualities should we seek when we look for someone new? And how can you maintain a company vision and culture when new faces constantly come and go, and teammates rarely see each other in person? These are relatively new questions for a lot of start-ups and entrepreneurs, but the world of sales has been dealing with them for many years. So we invited two global sales leaders to tell us how they handle the challenge of a mobile workforce. Dave Mattson is CEO and President of Sandler Training , a firm that develops international sales talent from over 250 offices in 27 countries. Norm Happ is Senior Vice President of Sales, Customer Success, & Partnerships here at Evernote, running a diverse global team with the same product he sells. In the latest episode of Taking Note: Conversations with Evernote , Dave and Norm sat down to discuss how companies can reap the benefits of mobility without suffering the friction. Listen below or read on for some highlights from our conversation. Taking Note: S2 E6 — Managing Remote Teams with Dave Mattson & Norm Happ http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-S2E6-Dave-Mattson-Norm-Happ.mp3 Length: 42 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS Right now, there is a huge move towards a mobile workforce; the need to stay productive without being tied to a desk. As sales leaders, you have been dealing with these issues for many years. What does this movement look like from where you sit? Norm Happ, Evernote: I would break it down into probably two distinct areas. First is just distributed teams. Teams that are in different places have a different type of work style and different tools because everybody isn’t sitting in a single location. I think that the significant advance that’s taken place probably in the last five to seven years is really the mobile workforce. They’re working from maybe an office, maybe a coffee shop or an airplane or a commuter train, or even on the sideline of a soccer field. Arming those teams with the right infrastructure, the right boundaries, and the right level of support is critical to success. If an organization is new, or it’s growing, and they’ve never had to deal with these issues before, what advice would you give to someone leading an organization like that? Norm Happ: It all begins with hiring great people—I would characterize that as people who have very high integrity, have great motivation. And then arming them with things like clarity on the mission, understanding how they’re going to be measured, and the right operating cadence to check in on those measurements. And then on top of that, you have to arm them with the tool set that’s going to enable them to get their job done, regardless of their physical location. And beneath all of this — and it may sound sort of quirky or obvious —it has to be fun. They have to remain connected to the mothership. They have to really feel like they’re part of a broader team. A downside or an unintended consequence of having people work remotely is oftentimes there’s a sense of isolation. Dave Mattson, Sandler Training: For us, when we’re building a mobile sales force, or we’re helping clients do that, the best thing to do is to look at the job profile, regardless of where they’re located. For example, say you’re calling on the c-suite and you’ve got a six month sales cycle, and you’re selling a $50 million piece of equipment. That’s different than if you’re calling on a VP of X for a $15,000, two-month sale, and so you have to match that employee to what your world looks like. It sounds easy, and it is, but most people don’t think about it. Once you’ve got that job profile, then I think you really need to look at what I’ll call a ‘candidate profile.’ We use this acronym, SEARCH, which is very simple: Skills. Experience. Attitude. Results. Cognitive Skills. Habits. I 100% agree with what Norm was talking about, as far as connecting them and making sure that they have the right tools and technology. I’ll shoot a video every Friday, and it’s a weekly recap of what’s going on and what we’re doing. People internally at our home office may know those things, but 60% of the workforce has no idea, and so we’re giving shout-outs to people who have done great things. We’re telling people what’s going on. And the feedback that you get from the external team is just amazing: “Hey, thanks for giving us that update.” With a team that is liable to be working from literally anywhere on the globe, in any sort of an environment, what are the specific characteristics that you would look for in a new hire? Dave Mattson: We’re searching for self-starters. You know, has that person had the experience and do they have the results of starting something from wherever it is. Do they hit their deadlines? Do they get their projects done in time? Time management is also a characteristic that we’re looking for because regardless of where you are in the world, projects tend to expand to fill the time that you give them. I’m looking for people who can take a project or a workflow from where it is today to where it needs to be, and have the thought process to get that done. Phone skills are huge. You’d be surprised at how many people really can’t communicate over the phone. And I think accountability is huge. When I do executive coaching, that’s one of the key things they always bring up: “I wish we had a culture of accountability.” Norm Happ: I think it has to do with things like integrity and motivation. But also really making sure that we’re crystal clear on, “What are the outcomes that we’re expecting them to achieve?” And making sure that they stay connected to the mission of the company and the overall company outcomes. Also, as you also touched on, the importance of recognition and making sure that there’s very deliberate actions taken so that they feel like they’re connected to the broader team. Dave Mattson: Setting expectations should be a corporate characteristic. You have to set clear expectations of what the job is, what the outcome looks like, what success looks like, what failure looks like. The better you can paint that picture, the better off that remote worker will be and, thus, the organization, and I think that’s something that really slips through the cracks with most organizations that are managing a remote workforce. They’ll have that conversation up front, thinking that it’s at the top of everybody’s mind, but it’s not. You have to continually reinforce and make sure that those expectations are super-clear, and then validate that they understood them. How do you maintain a vision, a mission, or a culture in your company when the faces are always changing, and often they’re not in the same room with you? Norm Happ: My experience is, you have to treat them all like employees and you really make sure that you invest the time to ensure that they understand the company’s mission, the company values, and really what we’re strategically trying to accomplish. If you treat them like second-class citizens or somebody who’s not part of the core workforce, I think really the results begin to reflect that disconnect. It does put a lot of stress on the onboarding and ensuring that you have a methodology and you have documentation and other information, that you can very quickly get that person up to speed and ensure that they can begin contributing very quickly. Is there any particular advice that you give to people when they’re joining your team? We’ve looked at this from the perspective of the manager. What does a new employee who’s joining a remote team need to keep in mind? Norm Happ: I think that every person in an organization is really an innovator and an inventor. As much as there’s process and rules that are intended to achieve the best outcomes, I really challenge them and set an expectation that, as you bring experience from prior organizations, or you identify things that would help the organization improve, please apply those. And then share those as best practices. Dave Mattson: Again, I think it’s expectations. We tell them, “You have the greatest ability to help us.” And what I mean by that is: we’re in it already. We don’t know what we don’t know any longer because we’re part of it. So, we would love you to tell us what you think is something that we do great and things that we really should work on because you’ve got experience from other companies and you’re new. And when we give permission to do that, you’d be amazed how much information that I can gather as a CEO, but also how much they feel engaged. And when they see changes being made based on their suggestions, “Hey, we did this because we heard X, Y, and Z.” That’s fantastic. I think the onboarding process really sets the stage for them to say, “I feel part of the company. I know what I’m supposed to be doing. I feel like I have the tools to succeed.” Most companies spend the majority of their time in the interviewing process, and then say, “Well, thank goodness we found the right person.” But they drop the ball in onboarding, and onboarding is really a simple process. Tell them all the things that they need to do to succeed in the first, let’s say, 60 days, 90 days, 120 days. And then you, as a manager, can give them candid feedback. But, as an employee, I’m motivated. Why? Because now, it’s in my ballpark. I know what I have to learn and when I’m going to learn it. I know where I stand. As a new employee, I want to succeed, the company wants me to succeed. I just think we fall short a little bit when we don’t give that foundation in the beginning. So any organization is only as good as the people you have, and it’s also only as good as the training you give those people and how effectively you bring them on board. But also, of course, especially when we’re dealing with a team that’s distributed or mobile or using freelance resources, it’s only as good as the tools that you give them. So, let’s talk a bit about tools. There’s an ever-growing number of tools available for businesses of all sizes. How do you determine what the right tool set is for your business? Norm Happ: The first tier of tools are the most obvious: the hardware solutions, whether that’s a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, that every individual needs to have. The next piece is: you need a method for them to create ongoing interpersonal relationships with their leaders and their peers. I’m a huge fan of all meetings taking place over video, and so a really easy to use, robust video conferencing solution is critical. This might be a bit self-serving, but we really find that, Evernote Business and the way that we use it is an incredible way for teams that are geographically distributed to all stay on the same page and eliminate that world of just flipping in and out of your inbox and searching through email from weeks and months ago, trying to find those important documents. My teams run basically everything that we do through Evernote Business. And there is one other thing that I would say is part of the setup, but not necessarily a tool, and that’s the work environment that you expect them to use in their home office or wherever they choose to work from. If they are in a customer-facing role, there’s certain elements of the home office that are critical. At one point, I was at another company and I took over a 200-person remote organization. We would see in our net promoter scores, comments about barking dogs and crying children and we thought, “Oh, my gosh. We really need to ensure that we set them up with not just the electronic tools, but the things that will help them isolate their home office and be in a professional work environment.” Dave Mattson: We have a Sandler backdrop because I agree they should have video communication. 55% of people’s rapport skills are lost if you can’t see the other side. So we made sure that a remote office looks like they’re in one of our conference rooms. Initially, it looked like we were going overboard, but it’s really proved to be the right move. We also make sure that they have templates. You’d be shocked at how many times a sales force is reinventing the wheel. They don’t even share the simple things, like PowerPoints. So, you’ve got Person A using their pitch book. You’ve got Person B doing theirs, and it’s just all over the place. They need a place to share and to collaborate. We did it without Evernote at first, and then we became a client of Evernote some time ago, and it’s really kind of changed the world. It’s true. But there’s a lot of things that can help you become more effective, and I think you have to decide what to use, because you’ve got people — we know who they are in my company, and I think everybody knows who they are in their company — that say: “we’re gonna chase the next shiny object in technology; wouldn’t this be awesome, oh, wouldn’t this be cool?” And it probably is, but I don’t think we’re going to be like a sailboat here and just tack left and tack right. I’ve seen that too many times. We’re gonna figure out what works for us and make sure that we’re teaching our people how to use it. If we make adjustments, great. If we have to switch, then there has to be a good reason why. Norm Happ: One of the tools that we use is a team communication charter. It helps us understand when to use which tool. You know, oftentimes you’ll hear people say, “well, I emailed that a few weeks ago,” or “I sent you a Slack,” or “I sent you a text message.” As a team, what we’ve found is that it’s best if you get very clear on when you use the phone, when you use video conference, when you text, when you Slack, when you email, and what’s the service level agreement for those. If you send me an email on a Friday at 7:00 PM, do you need a response at 8:00 PM? As a team, we got together and established those norms so if you really, really need something from me, you call. You don’t send me an email and you don’t send me a Slack message. You have to adjust your communication style to the content of the message and make sure that your entire team is operating under that same charter. I now preach this relentlessly. Another one that I push on is: I will not meet with somebody if it’s just over the phone. I will only do video conference. Because if it’s not in person or over a video, I really don’t know if you’re engaged in the conversation. I don’t know the circumstances. If we’re shoulder to shoulder, we would get the best work done, but if we can’t be shoulder to shoulder, I want to make sure that we get that same experience, and so I know that we’re both heavily engaged. Over the phone, you know that there’s many other things that people can be distracted by that you may not be tuned into. Any time you bring a new tool into your organization that’s going to change the way your organization works to some extent. Oftentimes, rather than adapting that tool to fit the way you work or the needs of your organization, the organization starts adapting to fit the needs of the tool or the demands of the tool, and the next thing you know you’re bogged down in process. Or you have to start from scratch and there’s a difficult period of churn where nobody quite knows how things work anymore. How do you avoid those issues? Dave Mattson: If we introduce a new tool, we don’t do it out of the blue. Somebody typically comes to us and says, “I’ve been using this off to the side, or I’ve heard of X and here’s what it’s done for me.” And then, we really look at it. Is that tool really what has caused the increase, or is it something else? And then we’ll let a small group start to play with it. That does a couple of things. It flushes out whether it’s an accident or whether it’s a pattern, but it also creates groundswell. Because when you have a group of people who are successfully using something that you’re not using, then I want to use it. But if I told them they have to use it? “Oh, my gosh. Here comes something from the home office again. They have no idea what we do out here.” Roll it out in such a way that people are waiting and saying, “Hey, when’s my turn? When are we doing it?” But I also think most organizations that roll out tools do not do a good job in following up. They roll it out and move on. And that’s the beginning of trouble. You need an implementation plan that helps people understand what that tool is doing over long periods of time. Norm Happ: Yeah. We encourage people to test out new things, but it’s a much bigger undertaking if you decide that you’re going to adopt them in a more widespread manner. Tools come and go, and you end up with data silos. There’s some great tool that a person in your organization decided they wanted to use with maybe a few other people, and before you know it, you have really important company IP or customer information that is now off in somebody else’s platform. We’re very methodical about tool adoption and we keep the number of core business tools that we leverage to a very small number. A great video conferencing solution, Evernote Business, and then beyond that, I would say that there’s very few other things that I use on a regular basis. Okay, Norm. So, let’s, let’s dive in there. You are the leader of a global team here at Evernote. How do you personally use Evernote Business to get your work done? Norm Happ: It begins with this concept that we’ve developed over the last year, called ‘Spaces’, and it’s part of Evernote Business. Each of our key initiatives, or things that we do on a regular basis, are encapsulated in what we call a Space, and within that is every single thing you would need to know about that body of work, and every single person who would need access to that body of work is able to operate within that. I’ll give you an example. For the sales organization, we have a Space called ‘Sales’, and within there are all of our sales forecasts, our playbooks, our onboarding plans for new reps, any sort of reporting that we need. And so, when a new person joins our organization, we’re not saying, “Well, go to this network drive and I’ll email these other documents.” Or when our CEO says, “Hey, I’d like to see the latest report,” it is all right there, all in one place, and there’s no excuse like, “I don’t have access to this drive” or “it’s not on my laptop.” It is across every single device that our teams carry. Whether it’s a drawing that we put on a whiteboard or Excel files that might be used for some advanced modeling, there’s all this different information, and it all sits in one place. Frankly, I can’t imagine how companies today operate without having a single encapsulated location for everything related to a particular initiative or topic. Dave Mattson: Especially if you have remote teams in different geographies dealing with the same issue, right? How many times have you heard, “Hey, I sent that to you. I don’t know where that is.” And the other thing that we found, which we didn’t expect, is that we were talking about decisions that we had made already, two meetings ago, but because it wasn’t easily accessible or it wasn’t located anywhere, we wasted a lot of time and we were inefficient. But now, everyone knows where we are, everyone knows where that documentation is, and it’s much easier for us to progress at a faster pace and we’re more effective, to be honest with you. Norm Happ: And I’m sure everybody out there has walked into a meeting before where questions arise, like, “What’s on the agenda, was I supposed to read something in advance and is there a deck and where’s the notes from the last meeting?” Using Evernote Business with Spaces, now every single meeting that I walk into, I have everything in one location, whether it’s the agenda, whether it’s the action items from the last meeting, or it’s the content that we’re gonna cover in that meeting, whether it’s, you know, a PowerPoint deck or a Google Doc or Google Presentation, it all sits in one Space, and so it really helps us use our meeting time most effectively. What other secrets do you have for staying on top of the day-to-day? Dave Mattson: I think you have to have a process. I create what I call a ‘cookbook’ or a recipe. And what I mean by that is: as a CEO, there are certain things that I’m going to do on a daily basis, a weekly basis, a quarterly basis. So I created a ‘cookbook’, which is nothing more than a behavioral plan. What do I have to do every single day in order to succeed? I’ll give you an example. I talk to five clients a day. Or, let me say, I call five clients a day, and that’s one of my cookbook items because I want to touch base with them. I may not talk to all of them, but I do that religiously. It’s just part of my everyday to-do list, and I have those types of cookbooks, or recipes, for all different types of things, but what it does for me is that I get to do little things along the way so I don’t have a massive project. I don’t forget to do certain things. And what I find is that it helps me get things done way earlier. Norm Happ: Two things that I think might be illustrative to this conversation. First is the importance of in-person contact and bringing remote employees in so they get to meet and engage with their peers and leaders. I try to get out to all of our remote offices on a regular basis so we have that interpersonal relationship. If times get tough or you’re working on something that’s super challenging, they know who the person is on the other side of that video conference a little bit more. The other thing is just the importance of the work product. Not the end product, but the work product. I have a philosophy of transparency, and so as I’m working on different things, I don’t want to have this great unveil at the end. If I’m working on a strategy document, I actually put it in a spot where everybody can see the work as it’s happening, and that then helps them buy into it and they’re engaging with that work product before it becomes the final version. I think that that not only engages my team, but also it helps create a better outcome. And so my notes, for example, for this podcast. My team in Zürich already has popped in and written some notes and helped contribute content to this that I otherwise wouldn’t have thought of. So I think that transparency and real-time collaboration is helping us end up with better solutions than people working in isolation. Dave Mattson is CEO and President of Sandler Training .

Visit our template gallery to browse pre-made templates you can add to your Evernote account. Learn more » With the sheer pace of change and introduction of new devices and apps, it’s hard to deny that a lot has changed at the office. And it’s not just the technology—from the way we work to how we actually find our jobs, navigating the workplace is now a whole different ballgame. New game, new rules If there’s a new game plan for careers now, then someone should write a new playbook. This is precisely what Alexandra Cavoulacos and Kathryn Minshew were thinking when they founded TheMuse.com , a career website that’s especially popular among millennials. The site provides curated job postings and an inside look at companies, with video profiles giving applicants a sense of what it would be like to work there before they even apply. But The Muse goes beyond the transactional nature of a simple job search by creating a community for career building. As the co-founders note, the job search process only makes up one stage in your broader career. With career coaching services, skill-building videos, and content offering expert advice, The Muse hopes to engage users not only when they are looking for a job, but also when they already have one. After growing their site to more than 50 million users, they’ve now expanded their efforts by publishing an actual career (play)book, The New Rules of Work: The Modern Playbook for Navigating Your Career . Their new book argues that the seismic shift in the way we work means traditional advice on landing jobs and building careers no longer applies. Instead, there are “New Rules” for building your dream career — and they’ve set out to put together the resources you need. Their “New Rules” philosophy centers around the idea that now more than ever, individuals are in control and need to take charge of their careers.  Alexandra and Kathyrn’s book provides practical tools and tangible ways for how to actually do that by including quick exercises and handy checklists along with their insights. Inspired by their approach , we created a set of templates based on resources in the book that will help you to organize and focus your career journey right in Evernote . Read on to learn more about these “New Rules” for work and get our templates. Blend, not balance: aligning your passion with your work “The last twenty years have seen a massive shift both in terms of what work means to us, and in what it demands from us,” Alexandra and Kathryn said. In other words, the boundaries between “working” and “not working” are getting more blurry by the day. Our always-on, always-available culture means that workers are finding that the aspiration of “work-life balance” is increasingly turning into the reality of “work-life blend.” This trend has important implications for careers. When work bleeds over into everyday lives, it becomes more critical that what we are working on is fulfilling and inspiring. If you’re going to be working into the night or answering emails right when you wake up, it helps to love what you do. Templates for finding a meaningful career Use these Evernote templates to commit to your goals, understand your values, and set an intention for the rest of your career. A Success Contract With Yourself — Stay accountable to yourself and what you’re trying to accomplish by writing it down and committing. Self-Evaluation: Your Career Values —Gaining a clear understanding of what kind of job will be fulfilling is crucial. Evaluate and reflect on where you’re at with this worksheet. Discovery, not search: managing the hunt But finding meaning in our work isn’t the only challenge. The task of finding a job has changed as well. Gone are the days when your career trajectory was clearly laid out in front of you. Career paths are now custom-crafted, not blindly followed. But while a whole world of possibilities is exciting, it certainly adds complexity to the traditional job hunt. As Alexandra and Kathryn note, in today’s world, “the professional aspirations of most people don’t fit cleanly in a search bar.” In essence, the very way we look for jobs is changing from job search to job discovery . We’re no longer simply searching for openings. Now, building a brand, networking, and seeking expert advice for crafting applications and acing interviews is just par for the course. Templates for career exploration and job applications Use these templates to explore careers, manage your job search, and excel at your interviews. Functions & Industries to Consider —What jobs are out there? Use this list of functions and industries to get the ball rolling on your brainstorming. Check off your areas of interest and then use the grid template below. The Muse Grid for Career Exploration — Figuring out what you want to do can be tough. The Muse has created a helpful framework for exploring career options by industry and by function. Job Application Tracking Worksheet —When you’re applying for a lot of jobs at once, things can get out of hand. Keep track of all your applications with this useful worksheet. Pre-Interview Cheat Sheet —Before an interview, you’ve got to do your homework. Keep all the things you need to nail it in one place. In-Person Interview Checklist —On-site interviews can be nerve-racking. Use this checklist to make sure you’re prepared for anything. Keep moving: advancing the ball Even once you’ve discovered your calling and gotten your foot in the door, the game is far from over. You have to succeed at your current gig and keep an eye on what’s next. Succeeding on the job in today’s world isn’t just about being functionally excellent. Communication, interpersonal skills, and productivity are becoming more important than ever. Teams are becoming more virtual, and new technologies are taking over, creating more opportunities for miscommunication and intent gone awry. And in an always-on world, it can sometimes feel like we should always be working. Maintaining productivity and making the most of our time is another challenge in this new world. Then, there’s the matter of figuring out how to get to the next level. As Alexandra and Kathryn put it, you aren’t climbing a predetermined ladder, you’re building your own path. In today’s new world, your career is what you make it — how you chart your course is up to you. This means you are in charge of improving your skills and making the next moves. No one is going to advance your career for you. Templates for career management These templates use the New Rules approach for staying productive and improving your skills. The Famous 1-3-5 To-Do List —Want to get more done? Managing your to-do list is key. Try breaking it down by focusing on 1 big thing, 3 medium things, and 5 little things you can do today. “Job Skills I Need” Tracker —Keep a running list of the skills you want or need to acquire in order to step it up. Job Skills Priority List — Looking to improve your skills? Figure out your priorities by identifying which skills can immediately impact your current job and which skills you need for the next level.

Visit our template gallery to browse pre-made templates you can add to your Evernote account. Learn more » Have you ever thought of school as something you can predict? No matter what class you take, the work that you do will be repeatable. Maybe you’ve noticed that school tasks are exactly the same no matter where you go or what class you take. You’ll take notes, you’ll listen to lectures, you’ll write papers, you’ll take exams. You can even predict that a pop quiz will come when you least expect it. It’s always exciting to start a new school year, so this is the perfect time to look at school work in a new way. If you’re going to be doing the same thing over and over (and you are), why not prepare yourself in advance by using these Evernote templates for students? Student offer: Get 50% off Evernote Premium » Templates for different types of thinkers There’s no right way to take notes, but if you remember to keep your notes predictable, studying can be simple. Cornell notes allow you to break down course material each day in small, bite-sized chunks. At the top of each Cornell note is a space to write the day’s essential question: what is it that each day’s lecture was meant to answer? Having that question answered at the top of each page helps you understand each lecture at a high level, and probably gives you some clues about what’s going to be on the mid-term and final, too. Are you more of a free-form thinker? That’s okay. There’s a note-taking template for you, too. Download and use this Class Notes template, and you can quickly jot down your notes, questions, homework, and to-do list for each class session. Then, set up a reminder in Evernote to help you stay on track. That’s right, you can have your class notes remind you to read them and take action, so you don’t have to remember all those deadlines. Pro tip: Did a fellow student miss a class and ask you for notes? You’ve got them covered. Share the note in Evernote, and they can open it whether or not they have an Evernote account. Perhaps your studies take you to an academic or professional conference. In this case, you might choose to use the Conference Notes template. These are the same templates that professional Evernote note-takers bring to conferences around the world. Use this template to capture points from each speaker, and follow their presentation slides as you type or write. Pro tip: Use your phone and Evernote’s audio recording feature to capture lectures and attach the recordings to your written notes, so you don’t miss a word. Another pro tip: Take photos using the Evernote in-app camera and get speaker slides, whiteboard notes, and even your handwritten notes from those classes that don’t allow electronics. Do more in school Use Web Clipper to gather the research material you found online. (Bonus: Web Clipper also automatically saves the complete source URL, which you’ll need for annotated bibliographies.) Import or scan PDF files and save them with your notes. Annotate PDFs —add notes, highlights, and arrows to call your attention to the most important parts. Plan to maximize time School is so much more than taking classes, studying, and exams. Though your planners will all be filled with different activities, count on having a daily to-do list, weekly tasks, and monthly obligations. Go back to school with Evernote templates for monthly , weekly , and daily planning. » Extracurricular organization templates In a club, fraternity or sorority, sports team, or political organization? If you are, then you know the drill. Somebody has to take meeting notes , organize agenda s, manage projects , keep track of goals and budgets , create marketing plans , and brainstorm ideas . Bring more to these meetings by using and sharing Evernote templates designed for clubs and teams. How to use the templates Create a “Templates” notebook in Evernote to contain all your templates. Add any templates you’d want your team to use into the “Templates” notebook. When you want to use a template, copy it from your “Templates” notebook to the notebook you want the note to live in. Put your information in the copy of the template you’ve created—you can edit the template to your heart’s delight. If you want to share a template with classmates, click Share—>Share Notebook. Add the emails of people you want to share it with (they’ll be able to read it even if they don’t use Evernote). Love all these templates and want to get them all at once? Join the notebook and get them all. Copy them into your Evernote account, and share them with your fellow students all year.", "date": "2017-08-2,"},

Learn more » It’s that time of year when thousands of writers around the world prepare to type faster than a speeding bullet, drink coffee more powerful than a locomotive, and leap tall deadlines in a single bound. We’re talking about National Novel Writing Month (also known as NaNoWriMo), and the challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to create a 50,000-word story from scratch in just 30 days, from November 1–30. How’s that for productivity? We’ve met a lot of writers who use Evernote to plan, brainstorm (and sometimes even draft) their novels, so we are proud to be a corporate sponsor of NaNoWriMo for the fourth consecutive year. But as any fiction writer knows, the hardest part of any new work is figuring out what to write about in the first place: What happens next? What motivates these characters? What’s this story about , anyway? Only you can answer those questions, but it helps to figure them out early. If you’re going to write a novel in November, the time to plan is now . With that in mind, we’ve created a dozen note templates to help you collect and structure your thoughts in Evernote. Many of them include questions or prompts to get you started, but you can feel free to replace those with inventions of your own. Start filling them out today and they’ll keep you anchored while you write your 30-day masterpiece. TIP: To use any of the note templates mentioned in this article, click the “Get it »” link and then click “Save to Evernote.” The template will be added to your Evernote account in the notebook of your choice (we recommend setting up a new notebook just for templates). You can then copy, move, rename, and edit the note to suit your needs. Learn more » The game is afoot: Plotting and outlining Are you the sort of writer who wants a solid plan in place before typing “Chapter 1?” You’ll need a roadmap that begins with a premise and culminates in an outline. There are a lot of different ways to get there, so we’ve made templates to walk you through several of the most popular plotting methods. Choose the one that fits your personal style: 1. Story premise worksheet Your premise is the foundation on which the entire novel is built. With this step-by-step guide, you’ll think about who your protagonist is, what he or she wants, and the problems or conflicts they must overcome. The end product is a concise, two-sentence explanation of what your story is about. Get it » 2. Three-act plotting template Remember learning in school that all stories should have a beginning, middle, and end? This classic, logical method of storytelling takes you from your story’s initial setup and inciting incident through rising action, turning points, and resolution. Get it » 3. Story beats template Adapted from the world of screenwriting, this popular method replaces the concept of acts with a set of milestones that commonly appear in many kinds of stories. Hitting these “beats” gives your story a rhythm while leaving the details open to your imagination. Get it » 4. Snowflake method checklist Maybe you’d rather work from the top down than from the ground up. Inspired by fractal geometry (really!), Randy Ingermanson’s “snowflake method” grows an entire novel from a single sentence. Each step of the process methodically expands upon the one before, filling in detail until you have a complete draft. Get it » 5. Story timeline tracker Regardless of the plotting method you use, keeping track of time in your novel is important. Did your hero get that threatening letter on Tuesday or Sunday? Does the next scene happen on a sunny morning or in the dead of night? This template will keep your novel’s clock ticking smoothly. Get it » 6. Chapter outline Once you’re in the writing groove, you may not want to wade through all your plotting notes to remember what comes next. This checklist gives you a scannable view of your plot, chapter by chapter and scene by scene, making it easy to see what you’ve completed and how much lies ahead. Get it » Who, where, when, and why: Characters and settings Even if you aren’t the plotting and outlining type, the more you know about your characters and the world they inhabit, the better your writing will be. The following templates will help you brainstorm and remember the little details that make a story come to life, or just give you a bare-bones overview for easy reference: 7. Character master list Got a lot of characters? This “quick and dirty” list helps you remember who’s who at a glance. Add names, ages, and comments. Drop in a photo or drawing of each character to help you visualize your story. Get it » 8. Character profile worksheet If you want to go deeper with your characters, you’ll need a full dossier describing their physical appearance, manner of speaking, behavioral traits, and background. From their hair color to their biggest secret, this questionnaire covers it all. Get it » 9. Character biography Now that you know who’s who, here’s a template for figuring out how they got to the situation in your novel. When it’s time to write a flashback or refer to a past event, you’ll breathe easier (and save yourself some edits) knowing you can look up the dates in this simple timeline. Get it » 10. World-building questionnaire So far we’ve been talking about the what and who of your novel, but where and when are just as important. Whether you’re writing about a fantasy world or the town you grew up in, this questionnaire will get you thinking in depth about the setting. Then you can write richer, more realistic scenes that draw the reader into your world. Get it » Pulling it all together: Project trackers A novel has a lot of moving parts. When you factor in research, articles saved with Web Clipper, and random jottings about who did what to whom, you’ll probably find you have a lot of notes for your writing project. Consider adding a couple more to keep it all straight: a dashboard where you can manage the whole thing, and a checklist for bringing your completed opus to the world. 11. Story dashboard note For a quick overview of your project, use this “dashboard” to track its status. Add it to your shortcuts for easy access, and insert links to related notes to save time on searches. If you’re writing in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you can paste the file or link into the body of this note and jump into your manuscript with a click. Get it » 12. Self-publishing checklist Planning to publish that novel when it’s done? Here’s a checklist of all the important steps, from writing a blurb to editing, design, and proofing. TIP: If you copy this checklist into your dashboard note, you can easily track your novel from first brainstorm to final publication. Get it » Ready, set, write!

Grab this Music Playlist template to share your song choices with the DJ or band in advance. The party’s over When you’ve sufficiently recovered from the merriment, add photos or videos from the event to your notebook so everybody can relive the happy memories later.

Learn more » It’s 4:45 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon, and you have one question on your mind: what should I be doing right now? You’re busy getting things done, but the notification count on your email inbox is climbing by the minute. You really should get back to Tom on… what was it again? Now the phone is ringing—it’s your kid’s teacher, informing you that your daughter’s grades are low and she needs some extra attention. You have an emergency meeting at 5:00, which kills your plan to finalize the agenda for tomorrow’s offsite. You’re starting to get texts from the attendees because you’re late sending out the logistics. You have a strategic plan that’s been almost finished for weeks, but you’ve been waiting for a board member’s input. And through it all, there’s a tickle at the back of your mind that there may be an even more important priority lurking somewhere, but you can’t remember what it is. Welcome to the era of information abundance, which has created in many of us a scarcity of attention. David Allen’s best-selling book Getting Things Done* (known affectionately by fans as GTD ) proposes a simple 5-step approach to managing the complexity of modern work. It has sold millions of copies in dozens of countries around the world and stands on its own as a practical guide to the art of stress-free productivity. It also just so happens that the GTD approach can be implemented easily within Evernote. If this article inspires you, grab these custom-made Evernote templatesfrom Barbara Fuller at Simplify Days to start the new year right with GTD: GTD Project List Template GTD Individual Project Template GTD Areas of Responsibility Template GTD Weekly Review Template Here are the steps to stress-free productivity that GTD recommends: CAPTURE every commitment in your life in a trusted place outside your head (like a software program or a piece of paper) CLARIFY exactly what each commitment is, the desired outcome of fulfilling it, and only the very next action required ORGANIZE reminders of these actions in a Project List REFLECT on your list on a weekly basis to make sure it’s clear, current, and complete EXECUTE on your actions by making intuitive decisions about what to do next, trusting your system to not let anything fall through the cracks The best introduction to what these five steps look like in practice is the Project List Mindsweep. It is a guided, step-by-step exercise to reveal just how many projects you’ve committed to in your work and life. This exercise is the first step in gaining a sense of relaxed control over your workload. It all starts with determining, clearly and visibly, the current state of your commitments. The energy unleashed by this capture exercise gives you the motivation to think through the four subsequent steps of clarifying, organizing, reflecting, and executing on your new workflow. I’d like to guide you through the Project List Mindsweep in this article. Add these four templates to your Evernote account so you can follow along with your own projects: GTD Project List Template GTD Individual Project Template GTD Areas of Responsibility Template GTD Weekly Review Template How to use Evernote templates » The Project List Mindsweep The Project List Mindsweep is extremely valuable for anyone, whether you’ve never heard of GTD or have been a dedicated practitioner for years. Most people couldn’t give you a full inventory of their projects if their life depended on it. Yet they also tell you they have too much on their plate, and “don’t have the bandwidth.” Without a comprehensive Project List, you can never know how much capacity you really have. Understand the GTD definition of a “Project” We use the word “project” to refer to a lot of different things, from a multi-billion dollar construction project to a bathroom remodel. But GTD asks us to adopt a much smaller definition for what qualifies as a Project: “ any outcome you’re committed to completing that requires more than one action step. ” This definition forces us to acknowledge that even the seemingly simplest outcomes—like “buy headphones” or “prepare a presentation”—require numerous steps. Instead of tracking these steps in our heads, we want to track them in an external tool. That way, we’re forcing ourselves to put a “stake in the ground” to remember to review our progress regularly. Your Project List contains all these “stakes in the ground,” so you can focus on only the next action. Most people find that sticking to this definition produces a list of around 30–100 projects. This is why we want to use an external tool—not our brains. Step 1: Capture Do a Brain Dump Don’t judge. Don’t filter. Don’t try to clarify, process, organize, or categorize them as you capture them. That happens later. Use the Project List template for this step. We’ll organize and clarify the list of projects you come up with in later steps. Here are some common places to look: Your mind What’s worrying you? Identify that as a Project. Name it so you can tame it. What’s taking more mental bandwidth than it deserves? What activities aren’t you making consistent progress on that could benefit from a bit of structure? Example: “My back hurts” → Schedule doctor’s appointment to diagnose back pain Calendar Look a few weeks into the past on your calendar: what do you need to follow up on? What do you need to finish? What Projects do you want to create to follow up on events that already happened? Peer into the future: what will you need to plan or prepare? What goals do you need to set? Who do you need to catch up with? Example: “I need to figure out what we’ll do at that team off-site” → Plan team offsite agenda Next Actions (To Do) list What things are you already doing that are actually part of a bigger project you haven’t identified yet? Example: “I need to follow up with that house cleaner” → Contact house cleaner and schedule weekly cleaning time Agendas What about communication? Are there any actions that you’ve already scheduled with people that are part of a bigger project? Example: “I need to call Linda back” → Develop sales campaign with Linda Briefcase/bag/wallet/purse What things have you saved because they remind you to take an action? What have you kept because you need it for a project? Example: Business card in purse → Follow up with potential contractor from conference Your physical environment Look around your office, home, car, or desk. What physical objects represent projects you haven’t identified yet? Example: Document on desk → Package up and mail document to business partner Digital environment Look at your computer desktop, downloads folder, documents folder, bookmarks, emails, and open browser tabs. What are you keeping around because it is part of a project that you can name and organize? Example: PDF article on desktop → Read draft article and give feedback to co-author Processes or procedures Which processes in your work or life could be more efficient, streamlined, or purposeful? What do you do regularly that takes too long, is too difficult, or you haven’t thought through? Example: Grocery shopping → Collect list of staple food supplies and set up recurring deliveries on Amazon Fresh Creative opportunities What would you like to learn, develop, build, pursue, start, explore, or play with as a project? Example: Flyer for improv class → Look up and schedule improv class Competence building Are there skills you’d like to learn? Which hobbies would you like to start? What kind of project could advance your career, or make your life more fun or interesting? Example: Email confirmation for online course purchase → Complete online course on Python Don’t worry about the exact outcome of each Project you identify at this stage, or whether you’re actually committed to it. Don’t let anything keep you from writing down something that might possibly be a Project. Also, don’t fret over how you name them. You might finish this step with a Brain Dump that looks something like this. Yours will probably be quite a bit longer. Schedule doctor’s appointment to diagnose back pain Plan team offsite agenda Find house cleaner and schedule weekly cleaning time Develop sales campaign with Linda Follow up with potential contractor from conference Package up and mail document to business partner Read draft article and give feedback to co-author Collect list of staple food supplies and set up recurring deliveries Look up and schedule improv class Complete online course on Python In the next step, we’ll decide what to do with these Projects. Step 2: Clarify Refine your list In the previous step, you got every potential project off your mind and onto a list, where you can view it objectively. Now it’s time to do another pass and clean up your list to make it more clear and actionable. Continue using the Project List template for this step, moving items from the Brain Dump section to the Project List section as you clean them up. Some options to consider: Delete anything that is obviously not a Project Sometimes you need to write a thing down to realize it’s not something you’re committed to or truly interested in. Delete and let it go. Move “someday/maybe” projects to the bottom of the list Move anything you might be interested in doing eventually , or you’re not sure you want to do, to the bottom of the list. Merge projects that are tied to the same outcome If you have related items such as “Research computer options,” “Back up and reformat current computer,” and “Set aside budget for computer purchase,” you can probably merge them under an overarching Project called “Buy new computer.” If a Project is really a one-time task, add it to your calendar instead For example, “Pick up sister from airport” doesn’t really need to be actively tracked over time. Place it on the appropriate day on your calendar, and that will trigger all the necessary actions. Delegate any appropriate Project Even if you delegate a Project to someone else, if you are accountable for the outcome, you still need a Project entry to track or follow up on that assignment. Step 3: Organize Identify the outcome or intention for each Project You aren’t finished calling something a Project until you identify the desired outcome. In this step, you’ll identify what you want to happen with each item. Then you can move it to your Individual Project template. Continue using the Individual Project template for this step, moving items from the Initial Project template to the Individual Project template section as you identify your desired outcomes. Some projects have a precise objective, like “Acquire 100 new leads and 25 new sales.” Other projects are more open-ended or intentional, such as “Have a peaceful vacation spending quality time and connecting with my family.” A classic and effective guide to formulating clear outcomes (or goals) is the S.M.A.R.T. framework . The acronym stands for “Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.” This framework helps you to make the outcomes as tangible and specific as possible, without getting distracted by grand, inspiring “life goals.” Simply ask, “What do I want to happen as a result of this Project?” Using our list as an example: Schedule doctor’s appointment to diagnose back pain [Outcome: Back pain is resolved and I can sleep through the night without discomfort, by March 1, 2018] Plan team offsite agenda [Outcome: Team is clear about what needs to be accomplished, and we identify next actions for every item on the agenda, by Monday, Feb. 19, 2018] Find house cleaner and schedule weekly cleaning time [Outcome: We have a weekly cleaning time on the calendar, and the house is consistently clean, by April 1, 2018] Develop sales campaign with Linda [Outcome: Sales campaign is approved by senior leadership, budget is allocated, and the team is briefed on it, by Dec. 15, 2018] Keep in mind that the ‘T’ in S.M.A.R.T. stands for ‘Time-bound.’ That means that every outcome should have a deadline or timeframe, whether that is a hard deadline or just a preferred one. Write the outcomes/intentions you’ve identified for each Project in the second column, and the time frame or deadline in the third column. Rewrite your Project titles to make clear how each Project leads to its desired outcome Time to do a little editing. Make sure you know what “done” looks like for every Project. There’s little chance you’ll ever get there if you don’t know where “there” is. Begin every Project with a verb that describes DONE: finalize, submit, deliver, complete, send, clarify, organize, update, implement, resolve, submit, reorganize, design, roll out, install, set up, publish, complete . If you find yourself using verbs like manage, oversee, ensure, or maximize , it’s probably an ongoing Area of Responsibility, not a Project. An Area of Responsibility is an ongoing part of your life in which you’ve committed to a certain standard, like Health, Finances, Apartment, or Productivity. These are also important to keep track of, but don’t belong on your Project List. You can move these items to our Areas of Responsibility template , to be managed separately from your Project List. Step 4: Reflect Review your GTD lists weekly Look over your entire list from a bird’s eye view, and ask some fundamental questions: Does this list fully represent my priorities, interests, values, and long-term goals? In which Areas of Responsibility do I have too many Projects? Not enough? Are there important outcomes or goals that don’t have any Projects targeted at them? Am I spending time or attention on something that has no clear outcome or goal? If anything is unclear, ask yourself, “What am I really trying to accomplish here?” or “What‘s the point of doing this?” With this whole inventory in front of you, are there any Projects you want to kill, postpone, renegotiate, or clarify? Reflect on your week with this Evernote template for creating a Weekly Review. Bonus step: Prioritize your list on the Project level Prioritizing individual tasks or pieces of information as they arrive can be exhausting because we’re trying to decide several things at once: Is this important? Is it urgent? Does it belong to a Project that’s important? Does it belong to a Project that’s urgent? Is this an insignificant detail, or a crucial one? You can eliminate a lot of this decision-making by pre-prioritizing your work on the Project level, instead of at the task level. Sort the list from highest to lowest priority, according to how much of your mental bandwidth each Project should be taking up in any given week. Doing this weekly will help make the granular decisions during the week much easier. Because your Projects are constantly changing and evolving, the Weekly Review is an exercise you want to do regularly. Senior GTD Coach Meg Edwards says that the Weekly Review is the “master key” to GTD. It is a standing appointment with yourself to reflect on the week and update your Project List. If you do this review from a more calm and balanced perspective, away from the chaos of the workday, you’ll find it easier to maintain perspective throughout the week. You’ll start thinking less like an individual project manager, and more like a project portfolio manager, balancing all the risks and rewards of your project portfolio as a whole. Step 5: Execute Regain control and be more productive With a clear Project List in hand, you are ready to execute on your tasks without having to remember which balls you have in the air. The goal of GTD is for stress, tensions, and obstacles to trigger new projects , instead of emotions.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Space to Do More with Your Team", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/the-space-to-do-more-with-your-team/", "abstract": "Throughout the years, great thinkers from Charles Darwin to Michael Jordan (yes, that Michael Jordan), have spoken eloquently of the virtues of teamwork. Even Steve Jobs, a man famous for his single-minded vision, once said “Great things in business are never done by one person; they’re done by a team of people.” Despite this lofty rhetoric, however, business teams often struggle from a lack of commitment, communication, and purpose. All of which begs the question: If teamwork is so great, why is working in a team so hard? What’s wrong with teams today? Brooks’ Law: Adding more people to a late software project makes it later. In his groundbreaking book, The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering , author Fred Brooks observed that adding members to a team led to additional communication and coordination overhead, as the lines of connection and responsibility increased. This effect was so pronounced that it became known as Brooks’ Law : Adding more people to a late software project makes it later. Although Brooks’ focus was on software development, his ‘law’ holds true for any group working toward a common goal: As teams grow in size, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep everyone on the same page. Emails may go unnoticed, announcements may be overlooked, and it can be almost impossible to schedule full team meetings. And as transparency between team members breaks down, opportunities for real innovation and partnership are missed. Teams that are not operating at their most efficient and collaborative level contribute to a huge loss in productivity, missed revenue opportunities, and a decrease in customer satisfaction. As a result, the entire company suffers. What if there was a way for teams to share, learn, and work together more efficiently? Welcome to Spaces in Evernote Business To help teams see the bigger picture and keep everyone in the loop, we’ve introduced an exciting new feature to Evernote Business, called Spaces . By changing the way people interact with notes and notebooks, spaces redefine how productive teams share and access information, and get things done. A space is a shared, central hub for all the information your team needs to turn ideas into action and move projects forward. You can create a space for a project, team, or topic, and fill it with notes, notebooks, documents, PDFs, images, audio… the list goes on. Invite anyone in your Evernote Business account to join the space to give them access to everything that’s in there. As a home for all your team’s work, your spaces get everyone on the same page. The information the whole team needs is easily accessible and always at everyone’s fingertips. In developing Spaces for Evernote Business, we’ve identified the following five pain points that are common to many teams. By addressing and resolving each of them, Spaces allows teams to work better together, and finally reach their full potential. 1. Addressing “Information Overload” Until the turn of the 20th Century, human knowledge doubled roughly every 100 years, according to author Buckminster Fuller . After 1900, however, what had been a linear expression changed to an exponential one. As a result, by 2025, the sum total of all human knowledge will be doubling every day. Fuller called this the “Knowledge Doubling Curve.” If you think that this is merely an intellectual exercise, think again; it actually has huge, real-world implications. IDC estimates that today’s knowledge workers spend an average of 2.5 hours every day simply searching for the information they need. That’s time spent not doing actual work! Spaces help to tame this exponential growth by giving you a central location for all the information your team needs to get the job done. When you save everything in a space—including links, documents, images, and PDFs—you always know exactly where to find what you’re looking for; no more searching for files scattered across team members’ individual computers, corporate servers, and ‘the cloud.’ You can also put Evernote’s powerful search functionality to good use, drilling down to pinpoint the exact content you need. 2. Preserving institutional knowledge It’s a fact of corporate life that most employees will eventually move on, as workers are more likely than ever to hop from job to job. When employees leave your company, they take their knowledge with them. You can replace them, but eventually the day comes when no one can remember what lessons were learned from that campaign three years ago—because no one who worked on it is still with the company! But when that knowledge is preserved in a space, you don’t have to worry. Since everything that is relevant to a project or team is shared with everyone who needs to see it, no information is lost. When you complete a project, collect the team’s observations and ‘lessons learned,’ and save them in the space. Refer back to them later to avoid repeating past mistakes or to see what the team did right. You can also bring new hires up to speed in an instant with a single invite. Employees come and go. But saving their notes in a space in Evernote Business means their knowledge doesn’t have to walk out the door with them. 3. Avoiding duplicate work As the saying goes, “The early bird gets the worm.” There is enormous incentive today for companies to innovate at speed, to get their products to market before their competitors. But as teams move quickly to achieve this goal, organizational protocols can suffer—and transparency is often the first casualty. One of the many downsides to this ‘need for speed’ is the danger that internal teams will become so unmoored from each other that they end up duplicating the work of others . Even within a single team, members may be working on a project, oblivious to the fact that a colleague is working on the same project! Understandably, this duplication wastes time that could otherwise be used to generate new ideas and knowledge. The resulting loss of productivity is a serious cost to the business; IDC says, “An enterprise employing 1,000 knowledge workers wastes $5 million per year because employees spend too much time duplicating information that already exists within the enterprise.” With Evernote Business, the “What’s new” and “Pinned notes” sections in a space help every member see exactly what the team is working on—and what’s most important. And the Space Directory gives everyone in the company visibility into what projects are being worked on at any time. This helps prevent duplication of work, improves productivity, and keeps the whole company aligned. 4. Working seamlessly wherever they are One of the most significant business developments of recent years is the growing trend toward remote work. Thanks in part to faster internet speeds and the desire for a better work-life blend , more people than ever are working outside the traditional office; in fact, companies like GitLab, Buffer, and Zapier have 100% remote workforces. Spaces in Evernote Business let team members stay connected wherever they go. Since Evernote Business syncs automatically across all your devices, everyone always sees the most up-to-date information in a space so vital information doesn’t go overlooked. Here’s one example: When a salesperson on the road adds a new customer order to a space, every member of the space sees it in their “What’s new” section: your billing department back in the office, your warehouse team in the next state, and even your financial analyst working from home. It all happens in the blink of an eye. With your team’s information in a space in Evernote Business, you’ll never miss a step. 5. Enhancing workflows You’re probably already familiar with the acronym BYOB (Bring Your Own Bottle/Beer). In business, a recent trend has been BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). But now, business culture is moving toward BYOA: Bring Your Own App . Different team members have their own ways of working, and their own favorite tools to get the job done. Increasingly, companies are finding it’s more effective to let employees find and use the apps they love than to try and police them. But information is lost and collaboration suffers when teams need to constantly go back and forth between apps, products, and documents. For BYOA to work, tools must be versatile and flexible enough to suit any team. Evernote Business enhances your existing workflow by integrating with the apps you love, such as Salesforce, Slack, and Google Suite—as well as devices such as Apple Watch and Amazon Echo. Save information from any of these tools directly into Evernote Business, then move them to a space to share your insights with the whole team. We’ll have more to say on each of these individual pain points in the weeks to come.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "To Beat Information Overload, Be Selective in Your Focus", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/beat-information-overload-selective-focus/", "abstract": "It’s easy to forget how ‘modern’ our modern technologies really are. The smartphone era is only 11 years old; the World Wide Web less than 30. Even the personal computer only dates as far back as the mid-1970s . Clearly, we’ve come a long, long way in 40 years. While computers are orders of magnitude faster and more capable than they were a few generations ago, and digital storage is vastly more expansive, the human brain doesn’t evolve at a similar pace. Our brains are still wired for survival in the world as it existed thousands, if not millions, of years ago: find food, raise a family, don’t get eaten by a lion . No wonder so many of us feel unprepared to process the sheer level of data that now bombards us daily. The problem of “Information Overload” Today we are witnessing the democratization of data. While most corporate knowledge was once stashed away on paper hidden in file cabinets and archive rooms, it is hardly hyperbole to say that the sum of all human knowledge is now only a few mouse clicks away. The flipside to that access, however, is that people are overloaded with information: files, notes, images, websites, business cards, emails, voicemails, and more. In fact, IDC estimates that today’s knowledge workers spend an average of 2.5 hours each day simply looking for the information they need. That’s time spent not doing actual work! We have seen such an explosive growth of data in recent years that the challenge now is not finding information, but picking out the relevant information from all the noise. We’re even overloaded with advice about ‘information overload.’ Try searching for that term on Google and see how many hits you get. So it’s clear that this is not a new problem. But what can we do about it? Clarity of focus What we let go of is just as important as what we keep. To overcome “information overload,” and succeed in the digital world, we need to be selective in where we direct our attention. If we cannot focus on everything, it’s vital that what we do focus on truly matters. In other words, what we let go of is just as important as what we keep. True innovators know that clarity of focus leads to the ability to ‘join the dots’ and make meaningful connections between disparate sources of information. They collect data, reject what is irrelevant, and identify what will help drive their ideas forward. Armed with this selective focus, they can step back, assess the playing field, and identify new paths to success. Establishing what is relevant to a team, however, becomes exponentially more difficult as members are added. In a group setting, everyone’s notes, ideas, and data need to be incorporated into the team’s workflow. As author Fred Brooks observed in The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering , as teams grow in size, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep everyone on the same page. Production slows, transparency between team members breaks down, and opportunities for real innovation and partnership are missed. For teams to work together more effectively it is critical that they have a strategy for managing data and tackling information overload. Only then will there be space to harness the creative power of the entire team. Space to get to your best work With Spaces in Evernote Business , it’s easier than ever to organize all your team’s information, and highlight the content you need, when you need it. By changing the way people interact with notes and notebooks, Spaces redefines how productive teams share and access information, and helps them find clarity of focus. A space is a shared, central hub for all the information your team needs to turn ideas into action and move projects forward. For example, let’s assume that you are directing the marketing campaign for your company’s newest product. You can create a space to hold everything your team needs to navigate a successful launch: task lists, brand strategy, market research, brainstorming sessions, customer personas, product images, vendor details, email copy, promotional videos… the list is endless. Then invite anyone in your Evernote Business account to join the space and contribute, including your marketing department, leadership team, or sales reps. As a home for all your team’s work, your spaces keep everyone on the same page. The “What’s new” section shows everyone what has changed in your space, so they can immediately see when a note has been added or updated. The “Pinned notes” section lets you highlight information that you want to keep visible, such as to-do lists and marketing calendars. Think of them both as virtual bulletin boards for your team. You can also tap into the knowledge of others in your company by discovering new spaces (and make yours discoverable) in the Space Directory. For example, you could join an engineering team’s space to stay on top of proposed feature updates. This helps surface the information you actually need, without any meaningless data that only slows you down. Taken as a whole, spaces bring everything together, allowing teams to save time and work more efficiently in one shared setting. As a result, they can focus on what matters and turn inspiration into results. Sign up for a free 30-day trial of Evernote Business today and see it in action for yourself.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Save Knowledge When Teammates Leave", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/save-knowledge-teammates-leave/", "abstract": "You know the feeling: Someone on your team announces at the staff meeting that she’s leaving the company for a new job. You’re happy for her. Really. But you’re also thinking about the extra work, interviews for a replacement, and general stress that’s about to come your way. And in a few months, you know you’ll soon find yourself at yet another farewell event as someone else moves on to new opportunities. And there’s a deeper level of dread, too. Because while losing your work friends is tough, this constant turnover has an even bigger impact on how teams function. Turning over teams When enough people leave, it can suddenly feel like a brand new team. No one remembers what the company did for that campaign four years ago, because everyone who worked on it is long gone. In today’s work environment, this type of turnover is becoming more and more frequent. It’s not uncommon for workers to put in a few years before moving on. And we’ve all read those articles about the ‘ job hopping ’ ways of millennials, suggesting that this trend will only intensify in the future. Add in a revolving door of contractors and freelancers, and the whole thing starts to get pretty messy. Adding up lost work and time There’s an old saying that ‘you can’t take it with you when you go.’ But we all know that departing employees take a considerable amount along with them as they head out the door—experience, previous work, culture. That’s because in today’s economy, people are the company. They bring the innovations and the ideas, they build the product and craft the marketing campaigns. So when they leave, it’s as if they’re taking a little slice of the business with them. Between documents spread out on shared drives and files buried in personal desktops that get wiped when employees leave, the past work we need access to is scattered to the digital winds. (And that’s assuming the knowledge was ever written down in the first place.) We can try to quantify it—some estimate that we spend 2.5 hours a day searching for information at work—but it’s hard to capture just how much wasted time and duplicated work is caused by the struggle to preserve knowledge across teams and time. Building a system that preserves knowledge “Invest in people like they will stay forever. Build systems like they will leave tomorrow.” So with this rate of turnover and loss of knowledge only set to increase in the future, what can teams do to build continuity as individuals come and go? Carmen Sample, an entrepreneur in the restaurant and retail space (industries notorious for their high-turnover rates), has an interesting perspective : “Invest in people like they will stay forever. Build systems like they will leave tomorrow.” Having the right systems and tools in place can help you bridge the gap when employees and teammates leave for new opportunities. And with the introduction of Spaces , Evernote Business is up to the job. With Spaces as your information hub, you can ensure that no matter the team or project, knowledge won’t leave when employees do. Every team’s work stays (and stays searchable), so your best work is never lost. Start a free trial of Evernote Business » Here are five ways your team can use Spaces to make sure previous work is always at your fingertips: 1. Keep your work in a space. That thing that only you know about the project you’re working on? It’s locked away in your head unless you write it down somewhere. Practice what you preach and be kind to your future self (and future colleagues) by making sure all the things you’re working on are saved and easily discoverable somewhere in a space. Move archived notebooks over and be sure to create spaces for new projects or teams. You can also integrate with Google Drive , Slack , and Salesforce to make sure you’re really capturing it all for posterity. 2. Build out some ground rules. Agree as a team on how you’ll use Spaces, laying out a team ‘ charter ’ that will be clear to new teammates as well. For example, consider making as many spaces as possible viewable to the whole company, that way it will be even easier for anyone to see what you’re working on. Also make sure to create naming conventions and standards, such as beginning all marketing space names with ‘MAR-’ or relabeling a space as ‘Archive’ when a project is completed. 3. Search the Space Directory. Your first stop when searching for past work should be your team’s Space Directory. It helps ensure that you can get to your team’s best work, whether it was done last week or last year. Tap into this collection of collective knowledge by searching for a term, such as ‘marketing campaign,’ and then join or request access to relevant spaces. 4. Expand and view at a glance. When there’s lots of previous work to dig through, it can take some time to get at what you need. Now you can quickly glance through all the notebooks in a space, expanding to scroll through notes without having to individually click and search through each notebook. 5. Create onboarding and exit processes. When onboarding new teammates, make sure to give them training on how to properly share their work and search for related information with Spaces. On the flip side, consider asking departing employees to organize and preserve their work before they go, moving it into spaces and setting permissions appropriately. Ensuring you can easily tap into the efforts of past, present, and future employees means that your team will always be able to get to their best work—no matter when it was done or who did it.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Discovering the Secrets of “Dream Teams” – Evernote Sits Down with Shane Snow", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/podcast-discovering-secrets-dream-teams/", "abstract": "We’ve all heard about “dream teams,” collections of amazing individuals who somehow become more than the sum of their parts and achieve extraordinary things. History is littered with legendary sports teams, breakthrough businesses, and other groups who overcome impossible odds, but such teams are still incredibly rare. So we celebrate them, mythologize them, and even build pop culture franchises around the dream-team concept (superheroes, anyone?). But beyond the myths are some questions. Where does synergy come from? What can we learn from the teams that have it? And how can we apply those lessons to our own work? To find out, we asked Shane Snow , author of the new book Dream Teams: Working Together without Falling Apart . In the latest episode of the Evernote podcast, Shane argues that the teams which overcome the biggest challenges aren’t necessarily the ones with all-star talent. Instead, they’re groups where a diversity of skills, knowledge, and ways of solving problems come together, harnessing the tension that results in ways that push them into new territory. Shane also shares how he used Evernote throughout the process of writing the book. Listen below or read on for some highlights from our conversation. Taking Note: S2 E4 — Dream Teams with Shane Snow http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-S2E4-Shane-Snow.mp3 Length: 41 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS What makes a dream team? So much of the conventional wisdom is that [building a dream team] is about collaboration, without really thinking about what that means. Just get the best and brightest people together in a room, and structure our offices to make sure that they’re all in each other’s faces all the time and magic happens, right? But you argue in the book that it’s not just about collecting all-star talent. Right. It turns out that when you look at, say, hockey or basketball, team sports that require lots and lots of coordination in order to win, you look at the data and it shows you that teams that have the best players actually tend to underperform versus teams that just have a couple of best players and then really good collaborators with them. There has to be some sort of chemistry. Yes. In the 1970s psychologists did a bunch of studies where they wanted to get at what makes people happiest at work, and what they concluded from these studies is that if you work with people who are very similar to you, having similar personalities, similar values, that you will be happier at work. And over the next 48 years, we conflated being happy at work, being comfortable at work, with success. We assumed that being happy means you will work together better, but it turns out that that’s the wrong thing. That’s actually not correlated with innovation at all. You can be happy and very innovative or you can be happy and not innovative. Turns out that our ideas around team unity actually tend to hold us back from what really matters, which is combining different ways of thinking so that we can come up with something better. And so, the result is we have teams that get along really well or that self-select for people who will get along well, who then don’t have the dissent that they need to think outside of their own paradigm. They don’t have the provocation to think harder, they don’t end up being as cognitively engaged on hard problems as they would be if they’d collected different people who would be more likely to not have similar personalities, but more likely to come up with better ideas together. I’m not saying that you can’t have a team that’s nice, that loves each other, but that is not correlated with success. And more often than not, it’s correlated with things that hold you back. Teams that actually do beat the odds, that add up to way more than the sum of their parts, the ones with the best stats, are the teams with the most interesting combinations of people. The analogy I like I to use is: you’re a movie director, you want to make the next best movie that’s uh ever been made, and it’s time to cast your actors. Do you take the last 20 people that acted in your last film and apply them to this film? Probably not. Do you pick the actors with the best GPAs, who just applied with their resumes? Probably not. Do you only select actors from Harvard? Probably not. You cast the most interesting combination of people that are going to help you make this groundbreaking film. The power of discomfort I think one reason that teams don’t seek out different ways of thinking is a natural tendency not to want to rock the boat. We feel like it’s easier if everybody’s naturally in sync. Doesn’t breaking that culture fit that you’ve established make it harder to work together? It does, and that’s precisely why you can do better. One of the things that happen in companies that try to be thoughtful about adding different kinds of people to the group is they immediately experience fear and conflict. Different people will have different ideas and what happens next is either going to be some sort of a showdown … or they hold back, they start to keep quiet, they participate less, they participate only if it feels like it’s safe to. And so what you end up with is a group of people who have fear and conflict, but who gets none of the benefits of that discomfort. You know, discomfort causes us to think differently, to engage our brains more and in different ways, and this is how we come up with better solutions to problems. So often when we’re discussing this idea of diversity, we’re only discussing half of it. And then the second half we often discuss is: how do we make this comfortable for everyone? We have all these different people now, how do we make them comfortable? We want to make them feel safe, but being comfortable is not the point. Being comfortable is actually liable to hold us back. It’s possible to have full personal and emotional support and also full intellectual conflict. That I think is the ideal. But we tie those two things too closely together. Some of the other folks who’ve appeared on this podcast have spoken about a “discomfort zone” — the notion that we make the best progress when we push ourselves beyond our comfort zone. But we don’t want to go so far that we set ourselves up for failure. Throughout the book, you talk a lot about the potential energy that is unleashed by tension, and you use this metaphor of the rubber band. You can chart the amount of potential that a group or relationship has between them, and the more tension between their different ways of thinking or approaching problems, the more potential energy there is. It’s almost like a skateboard ramp. On one end, there’s kind of very little potential because there’s very little tension, and it goes up and up and up. But at a certain point, there’s so much tension that the dynamic turns into a destructive one. Often this is where a group is working on foiling each other rather than solving problems together. But the goal is to stay in that zone where there’s as much potential as possible, and that’s the place where there’s most tension. So our challenge is to keep our relationships, our conversations, our debates, our exercises and problem-solving in that area where we have the most potential. You want to keep the rubber band stretched tight because it has all this energy, but we don’t want to turn it on each other and shoot each other with it. Banding together I’m reminded a little bit of the science fiction trope where the thing that finally gets humans to stop killing each other is when the external threat appears, right? The killer asteroid or the alien space fleet lands and then we suddenly realize “Oh, we’re more alike than different; let’s go fight that other thing.” Is this what teams need? To rally around a big challenge? This is what psychologists call a superordinate goal, a goal that supersedes all other goals. An existential threat is a really good way to get a superordinate goal, ’cause we all want to survive. But, you know, if you’re working in a business — say you’re working in a software company — the superordinate goal is kind of hard to find. We all have different goals. It’s hard to say “if you don’t do this, you’ll die” and for people to believe it. It’s hard to manufacture that. But it is possible to simulate that and this is where, I think, an overriding purpose is very helpful. There are a lot of great groups in history that were very different, did not necessarily believe in all the same things, but did have one overriding purpose were able to come together and use that as a way to bond. The trouble we get into is we think that our beliefs have to be the same in order for us to do that, and that’s not the case. But our purpose of what we’re striving for, if it’s powerful enough, can be that. And the thing that happens is when you have this really strong superordinate goal, this shared purpose, you start to do what they call an optimal distinction: you want to be different, you want to have your identity, but you start to respect the fact that your distinctions can be useful to this purpose and other peoples’ distinctions can be useful to this purpose too. And in the right environment, it allows you to see yourself as part of one big group, but also part of your own group, which is sort of important to us psychologically. I think that the best analogy is a great family. A family that is really powerful, that is really strong, is the family that no matter what the kids decide to do with their lives, no matter who leaves home, the family is the important thing. It’s hard to get to that point in a group that’s working on something that doesn’t matter that much, you know? But you can see how things that you are working on can translate into something that people care about more. You’re building buildings but you’re actually providing a place for people to live and for families. People that care about that thing, that’s who you want on your team and then they can be different and distinct, and it’s okay. So it’s not just about the thing that you’re doing, it’s about why you’re doing that thing and who can you find who can resonate with, understand, and act on that reason? And not forcing people to care about that thing, but finding people who do care about that thing no matter how different they are. Going to the edge Often when we’re thinking about breakthrough ideas, you have to go pretty far out of your comfort zone to get to them. If you’re going to move from flat earth to round earth, you have to really kind of smash the paradigms. But that also opens the door to really crazy, kooky ideas. How far is too far? I spent a good deal of time on this question. There are these two competing studies that I discovered that were really troubling. One was the attributes of people we’re likely to put in leadership, and the main attribute that inversely correlated with being promoted or elected is creativity. And right around the same time I read this study, they surveyed Fortune 500 CEOs and asked what attributes does the next generation of CEOs need to be successful, and they said number one is creativity. So that’s troubling. Creativity is risky. Something that is outside of the norm could be good or it could be bad and we feel less safe when we have that. So you draw that to sort of its extreme conclusion. If we operate within our normal boundaries, we are unlikely to make breakthroughs but we are also unlikely to fall into a pit and die. So the question becomes do we need crazy people who are willing to go out into the unknown, to explore the edge of the map? The thing that I’ve concluded, and it’s backed up by research, is that even terrible ideas can be very useful. Someone who’s explored the edge of the map has paved the way for us to explore what’s in between. Even a clearly bad idea that is not directly applicable to the situation you’re in can still be useful by pointing your thinking in an entirely new direction. Sometimes maybe you need to go all the way to the edge and then pull back a bit and that’s when you start to find things that actually can help you. And I think that is a case for never ignoring people who we write off normally as crazy. Whether they’re crazy or whether they’re geniuses that we don’t recognize, whether their ideas are good or bad, paying attention to them and exploring them can help us to come up with new and better ideas in our own work. Storytelling as a hiring tool Now, on a realistic level, I work on a creative team. I don’t necessarily want to start hiring raving lunatics but I do want to enhance the creativity of the team. How do you go about identifying what a good individual fit would be on a team? How would you test for this? is this something you could bring into a job interview? My favorite mechanism or device for determining the potential for a different mental toolkit is storytelling. There’s the checklist of things that people need to know in order to be qualified for a job, but sometimes I think we have the wrong checklist, often we do. If you are going to get the job, there’s a certain set of things you need to know how to do. The more interesting thing for me in interviews is getting at someone’s personal story. So I like to ask questions like, “What’s a time in your life when you really changed your mind about something really important?” And I like to push people on that. I’ll also ask, “What’s something that you know how to do that most people don’t know how to do and can you teach me? And how did you learn that?” Or, “Outside of a work context, what do you like to read?” And these kinds of questions get people to start talking about their unique story. You’re also giving them implicit permission to be themselves, which is really important. We often show up to interviews trying to conform to what someone expects us to be. But the guy who was a piano tuner before he became a computer programmer and who has a great story of how he made that switch, might have a different way of looking at the world than the five people you just hired who were just computer programmers straight out of college. And you don’t really find that out necessarily unless you get people to dig into their story. Looking for culture add or cognitive contribution rather than culture fit or cognitive fit is really important. And stories are a way to do that. I asked two people in one day the “what do you read” question in job interviews. And one guy said, “I read sales blogs and sales books. Sales all the time, I just love it. I get up in the morning, I read sales.” And, you know, he’s probably lying about this. Who does that? Next person I interviewed said, “Well, I have three young kids and they’re starting to get to this age where they’re reading young adult novels, so I’ve started reading these books that they’re about to read so I know what’s in them. And I have to tell you, it’s kind of embarrassing, but I really love these books and I think that vampires are on their way out and angels are the next thing.” And we spent 15 minutes talking about vampires and werewolves. I learned something about who she is. You can’t ask in an interview if someone has kids but I learned through her talking about this that she manages a house of three crazy, young kids and she’s very thoughtful about the way that she does it and she also is a delightful, multidimensional person. Only one of those people got a job that day, and you can guess which one it was. Evernote as a writing hub I know you’re an Evernote user and you used Evernote pretty substantially in the creation of this book. Tell me a little bit about your process. I’ve been using Evernote for years as my own personal productivity tool to remember everything, right? As a journalist, as a business person, I take my notes in Evernote, save my notes in Evernote, and for this project, because I wanted to inject more collaboration into this process, I made more use of Evernote than I ever had before. So I have this whole workflow where I’ll do an interview, and I’ll record using the Evernote audio recorder. I’ll have that sent to be transcribed into a Word doc, and then that goes back into Evernote. So I have my interview that now is in audio and text, searchable in Evernote. I don’t even have to tag it anymore because the search tool is great. So I do that, I clip research from the web, I save PDFs in there, I take photos of everything. It’s all inside of Evernote. And then, as I’m assembling my article, or in this case chapters, I have them in one place. I think this book is so much better than my other books, not just because I’m a more mature writer, but because I collaborated with many more people and I had many more sources as part of this process, and organizing all that, searching all that, filtering all that is just so much more possible using a centralized tool like Evernote. So I’m kind of obsessed. I’ve convinced a lot of people in my life to start using Evernote, but I wouldn’t do it unless it was truly useful for me. How do you organize your notes? I have different [stacks] of notebooks for the big projects. So for this book, there’s a Dream Teams collection and inside of that are notebooks for each chapter, each concept, a notebook for general research and notes, which basically I’ll save stuff into and then I’ll sort it later. The nice thing about the search tool is if I put things in the wrong notebook, it’s going to be fine. And then, I have a notebook for marketing, a notebook for general ideas. And then, in each notebook I have the different PDFs, research documents, notes I’ve taken, interview transcripts, and then I’ll generally have a note that has my to-do list, and I kind of use that as my own project management. Breaking the mold You included a lot of amazing historical stories in the book. Did you discover any new personal heroes? Yeah. In the first chapter, I talk about the first female detective in American history. Her name is Kate Warne and she is awesome. She was instrumental in not only saving some very important lives but also setting the foundation for what we now know as the modern private detective agency and how we do detective work. Also, the U.S. Secret Service comes from the group of collaborators that she was a part of. She was so good at disguises, at ferreting out secrets, about getting people to cough up information, she was sort of the smooth-talking detective that was the counterpoint to these other detectives that would, you know, kick down doors. She was so good at this job and her boss, Allen Pinkerton, recognized that she could bring something unique that the rest of the agency couldn’t, at a time when police departments were exclusively men. He knew that was going to make things better. And she literally changed the world. I won’t spoil it, but the course of American history would’ve gone very differently if not for this woman. And so she’s one of my heroes. Shane Snow is co-founder of Contently , a technology platform for content creators.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "3 iOS Power Moves You Need to Know", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/3-ios-power-moves-need-know/", "abstract": "The eyes of Apple fans are on San Jose, California this week, as they digest the news from the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). While this event typically doesn’t produce the same headline-grabbing announcements as Apple’s September event, there are still plenty of reasons to be excited. Previous WWDCs have seen the unveiling of the iOS App Store (2008), FaceTime (2010), and Apple Music (2015), to name just a few. This year’s conference has so far focused on highlighting small improvements rather than introducing revolutionary new products. We’ve seen features that will become part of iOS 12 and watchOS 5; upgrades to Siri and FaceTime; and a new, dark mode in macOS that users have been clamoring for. At Evernote, we’ve been keeping a close eye on the conference, and making our own notes on how to incorporate these new updates. Our goal, as always, is to make it easier for you to organize your work, declutter your world, and find what you need—fast. With that in mind, this is a great time to take a closer look at how you can get the most out of Evernote on your iPhone or iPad right now. Here are three of our favorite tips for feeling a little more in control of your life: 1. Save time with Siri There’s no doubt that Siri changed the landscape for automated digital assistants. What was once the domain of science fiction, we now take for granted: that we can talk to our devices and have them give us a (seemingly) intelligent reply. Thanks to our integration with Siri , you can take notes in Evernote without even needing to touch your device. Create a shopping list on your iPad while you’re making breakfast. Add to-dos to Evernote on your iPhone while you’re stuck in traffic. Use your EarPods while you’re working out to tell Siri to create a note. Here’s how it works: Awaken Siri by saying “Hey, Siri” to your device and then simply speak directly to Evernote. Keep in mind that, although Siri may seem smart, you’ll need to use specific phrases get her to do what you want. Here’s a list of the commands you can use: “Create a note in Evernote called Meeting Ideas,” or “Create a note called Meeting Ideas in Evernote.” “Add ‘I should bring pizza’ to my Meeting Ideas note in Evernote.” “Create a list in Evernote with ‘Order lunch’ and ‘Make itinerary,’” or “Create a list with ‘Order lunch’ and ‘Make itinerary’ in Evernote.” “Show me the notes I created today in Evernote.” With Siri by your side, you’ll be ready when your next brilliant idea comes along. 2. Keep it all together You have photos on your iPhone, a to-do list on your iPad, and PDFs on your laptop. But what if you want to access a photo on your laptop, or a PDF on your iPhone? When the information you need is spread across different devices and different apps, you’re left playing a game of “Wait… where did I save that again?”—A.K.A. the Information Shuffle . That’s where Evernote comes in. Saving content in Evernote on your iPhone or iPad is more than just clipping websites—the same feature works for documents, photos, and PDFs. Evernote syncs across your devices , so you can access all your content everywhere you go. Any notes you create, websites you clip, or images you save in Evernote appear automagically on every device associated with your account. The best news is that using this feature is a no-brainer. Simply look for the square with an upward arrow in the navigation bar of any app that allows sharing, such as your Photos app or Safari. Select Evernote as your sharing option and save it directly. It’s instantly available on all your devices. With this feature, you can save websites, notes, images, and files in Evernote—you can even add tags to make it easier to find them later. And you’ll never have to play the Information Shuffle again. Note: If you don’t see Evernote as an option, you may need to enable it first. Simply tap “More” at the end of the sharing app list to change this setting. 3. Get your time back Life moves quickly, and you’ve got things to do. Thankfully, Evernote is right there with you, helping you organize your life and your ideas. We built Evernote to help you capture ideas at the speed of thought (OK, maybe it’s not that fast, but it’s still pretty quick). Part of that is through a clean, uncluttered note-taking experience on iOS that helps surface the information you need, when you need it. There are also a few little tricks that might seem small, but which can mean the difference between capturing that great idea in the moment and losing it forever. Here are two ways you can capture your ideas in Evernote even faster: Use 3D Touch —On your iPhone, press firmly (but not so hard you break the screen!) on the Evernote icon to bring up a preview of your most recent note, along with a menu of quick actions you can take. Create a new note, take a photo, create a reminder, or search Evernote—all without opening the app. Press and hold —On iPhone or iPad, open Evernote and long-press the green ‘+’ button to quickly add a picture, record your voice, or set a reminder. No digging through menus required. We’ll have more in the weeks to come on how we’re incorporating the latest iOS updates into Evernote. For now, these tips will help you capture your ideas faster, and do more with your notes. Have a favorite iOS power move we didn’t mention?

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Can Jazz Teach You to Be Better Organized?", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/can-jazz-teach-you-to-be-better-organized/", "abstract": "The night in early 2016 was cold and clear, but inside the small jazz club in Old Lyme, Connecticut, the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Standing on the low stage at one end of the room, saxophonist Mike Casey was deep in concentration. His eyes shut tight, the young musician was focused on the creative interplay between himself, bassist Matt Dwonszyk, and drummer Corey Garcia. It was the biggest night of Mike’s musical career, and the evening was being recorded for posterity. But despite the audience’s enthusiastic support, Mike felt uneasy. “I was sick, I was exhausted, and I thought I was playing horribly,” he says. “I remember finishing the first set thinking ‘I am really not feeling this.’ So I was bummed. I was like, ‘Man, I’ve got to get it together for the second set.’” After the show, however, he was stunned. “I got the recording back from the show and thought ‘Oh, wow… I think this is going to be my first album.’” Mike was right. One year later, “The Sound of Surprise” was released to rave reviews, passing 500,000 streams worldwide in its first year—a remarkable number for an unsigned jazz artist. What happened? Of that night, Mike says, “I realized that I’d been in a mental flow state, completely unaware of how I was actually playing.” What he’d thought was a bad night turned out to be one of the high points of his career. The concept of mental flow is sometimes called ‘deep work,’ or being ‘in the zone.’ Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of “Flow,” describes it as “Being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you’re using your skills to the utmost.” The one tool that Mike credits with helping him find flow and achieve his musical goals? Evernote. Composition and performance: two sides of the same coin In addition to his career as a performer, Mike is also an accomplished composer. Of the seven tracks on “The Sound of Surprise,” three are his original compositions. It’s an unavoidable part of having a restless, creative mind, he says. “I’m always questioning things. I’m always searching for something. That’s part of who I am.” When the inspiration for a new song strikes, Mike has an unusual method for capturing it. “If I have an idea, and it comes to me while I’m practicing, I’ll record it in Evernote,” he says. “It’s great because it’s quick.” That speed is crucial to his creative process. Jazz is an artform that thrives on immediacy and instantaneous creation. Each solo can become its own melody—indeed, legendary jazz artists such as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were renowned for using their improvisations as the seed for entirely new songs. Mike’s philosophy is that the quicker he can capture an idea, the more emotional weight it carries. “The moment it happens is when it comes with the most creative force behind it.” That’s not to say that the composer’s work is done once a tune has been saved. Mike says that being able to let an idea sit, and revisit it later to see if it still resonates, is crucial. “I separate my composition process into two sides. I let the creative moment happen, and then later I’ll go and edit it.” It’s here that Evernote has added the most value to Mike’s creative workflow. “The tool is a big part of the process,” he says. “I’d rather document something the moment it happens and be able to listen back. That process lets me delve deeper and simplify, and weed out things from the composition.” He may let an idea sit for months, or even years, before completing it. But he knows that, with it saved forever in Evernote, it’ll be there when the time is right. Keep it all in Evernote Although Mike credits Evernote with helping him capture his musical inspiration, he uses it for much more than that. “It’s like a huge filing cabinet for me. If I find an article online that I want to get back to later, I’ll save it in Evernote.” In particular, the ability to search inside of clipped articles, documents, and PDFs is a game changer, Mike says. “It just blew my mind when I saw what it can do. It’ll even search the text of the article, which is a huge help with the way my brain works.” A bright future ahead Mike’s experience with flow has turned out to be a remarkably fruitful one. On that night back in February 2016 when he recorded “The Sound of Surprise,” a further seven tracks were recorded but not included on the album. Now Mike is releasing them as “Stay Surprising,” his second album, which is on track to pass one million streams in its first year. Mike Casey’s success is the result of years of practice, developing the musical language and organizational systems to allow him to access the creative part of his mind. “The mental flow state ties into that, and Evernote helps me capture things while I’m in that state,” he says. “I’m learning more and more that the most important thing is documenting things and keeping yourself in that flow.” And how does he get there? “For me, everything starts in Evernote.” —————– Check out Mike Casey’s website for more info.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Slack, Salesforce, and Evernote: Now on the Same Page", "author": ["Neal Cavanaugh"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/slack-salesforce-evernote-now-on-same-page/", "abstract": "Think of the last time you were able to sit down for an hour or two and truly focus on a project uninterrupted? If you’re having trouble recalling the last time, don’t worry, you’re not alone. The fact is, we’re inundated with information and distractions. A recent report from Udemy showed that 69 percent of full-time employees struggle to cope with distraction at work. Sometimes these distractions are obvious, like meetings, phone calls, etc. But sometimes they’re as subtle as switching back and forth between apps. That’s why one of the biggest requests around the office is to simplify and look for tools that play well with one another. Evernote evolves with application integrations Evernote is more than simply a note-taking app, it has long been the go-to application designed to make staying organized and on-task as easy as possible. It’s flexible, user focused, and friendly. And it likes all kinds of input: handwritten notes, typed notes, photos, images of docs, and audio—not to mention anything you save from the web. And it’s all searchable. One of the ways Evernote continues to evolve is its ability to work with other applications. According to a UC Irvine Study , refocusing your efforts after an interruption can take up to 23 minutes. When there is less friction between apps and tools, you can reduce distractions and stay focused on what matters most. Two of our recently updated integrations include Slack and Salesforce , both very robust and well-established apps that have teamed up with Evernote to create one tremendously useful tool. Evernote Business and Salesforce The Evernote and Salesforce partnership has evolved into a deeper integration between the two, making it easier than ever to work in both apps simultaneously without interruption. Work the way you want — Salesforce data is highly structured. On the other hand, Evernote is as unstructured as you want it to be. The value in this integration is that now you can access Evernote from within Salesforce. So a highly detailed record in Salesforce can benefit from a direct link with conversations and notes you’ve made in Evernote. Pin it to win it — When you make a note in Evernote and you want it to be seen and read by all your team members using Salesforce, pin it. It will be instantly visible and available within Salesforce. And all notes are tracked within the record’s activity history so managers can easily monitor performance. Two-way sync and search — It doesn’t matter whether you create a note in Evernote or Salesforce, notes in both applications will stay in sync. And everything is searchable in both applications. Evernote Business and Slack Slack has picked up serious momentum as the preferred direct messaging service for thousands of businesses. It’s easier to control than email. You can attach docs. Setup channels. And people use it. If you Slack someone, you’ll probably get a response. With the Evernote Business Slack integration, you get a lot more than a response. You get better ways to communicate. Our Slack integration takes full advantage of the new visual ‘Actions’ capability in Slack. For example: Make a note to yourself — While in a Slack conversation, you can write a note to yourself without leaving Slack. As your Slack conversation continues, write notes and they will automatically show up in Evernote in a note called “Note to self from Slack.” You can edit them and move them later. Save Slack conversations — There are many times when decisions, information, and to-dos are discussed in detail in a Slack conversation. Now you can save them to Evernote. Clip a single message or an entire conversation and your Slack dialog will be saved in Evernote. Moveable and searchable. Focus on what matters most — Plenty of researchers have looked into what happens to productivity when people are constantly rotating between different tools and apps. One study shows that when you switch from one productivity app to another it can take up to 23 minutes to refocus and move forward with your work. The Evolution of Evernote Every Evernote integration is a benchmark in making your business software work better together. Helping you focus on what matters most is part of our DNA. Instead of toggling between apps and figuring out how to keep things in sync on your own, Evernote helps you stay focused on your work, not how to work.", "date": "2018-08-22,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Love Books? Why Evernote is a Bibliophile’s Best Friend", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/love-books-evernote-best-friend/", "abstract": "Prologue: Books are magic Ever since the first scholars and scribes put stylus to scroll and codex, humanity has had a love affair with books. And why not? “Books are the quietest and most constant of friends,” wrote educator Charles William Eliot . “They are the most accessible and wisest of counsellors, and the most patient of teachers.” More than that: books are magic. They’re bigger on the inside than they are on the outside. Their pages hold earth-shaking ideas, unexplored worlds, entire universes of thought. And once they’ve caught you in their silent embrace, they may just take over your life. Before you know it, you’re carrying them out of libraries and bookstores two, three, or five at a time, to fill your shelves and devices with words. You use them to learn about reality, to reimagine it, and to escape from it. And if you become too lonely while lost within their pages, you join a book club to talk about them. But as the books pile up, so do the challenges of remembering what you’ve read… and figuring out what to read next. Fortunately, there’s an app that can help with that. Whether you’re into epic fantasy series or practical business books, the musty smell of vintage hardcovers or the sleek feel of a brand-new Kindle, Evernote can help you keep track of your reading. And if you’re writing a book yourself, Evernote is a great place to organize your ideas so you can focus on the joy of writing. Chapter 1: Evernote for Readers Evernote is handy for recording thoughts about things you’ve read, but that’s only scratching the surface. Here are some more ways to manage your bookish tendencies: Keep a TBR list Book recommendations come from everywhere: friends and family, librarians and store clerks, Oprah and Obama . Before you know it, your TBR (“to be read”) list can become an unmanageable pile of Post-its and other scraps of paper. Why not keep it in Evernote? Jot down a recommendation on the fly and your list is automatically synced between your devices. You can refer to it in the library, at the bookstore, or when it’s time to decide which book to start reading next. And don’t forget to make a note of where the recommendation came from—you wouldn’t want to let your best friend’s favorite book fall to the bottom of the list! A simple bulleted list can do the job, or make a table if you want to kick it up a notch. Just passing through a bookstore at the airport? Take a photo of the cover to save time typing. Organize a book club There are lots of different approaches to book clubs. Some groups meet for serious discussion, others mostly show up for the cheese. But regardless what kind of book club you belong to, everyone needs to know what book to read next month and when the meeting will be. At the meeting, everyone will have thoughts on the book (assuming they’ve read it; see “cheese”). And you’ll probably all want to look back at the end of the year to remember the great books you’ve read together. With Evernote, you can create a notebook specifically for managing your book club, then add a note for each meeting listing the book details. Fill it in as soon as a new book is chosen, drop in some discussion questions, and maybe add a link to Amazon or your local bookseller to make the book easier to get. Click the Share button on the note and voilà! Everybody in the club can view it, even if they don’t use Evernote. After the meeting, add some comments about how the discussion went. Did the club love it? Hate it? Did someone bring an outstanding bottle of wine? The entire history of your book club is available online for your friends to browse. Download the Book Club template » Save highlights from your Kindle Ebooks can’t match the tactile experience of reading from paper, but they’re incredibly convenient. Amazon’s Kindle devices and apps make it particularly easy to highlight and save your favorite passages, but then what? Here’s the simplest way to get those notes into Evernote, where you can make the most of them: From a laptop or desktop computer, point your web browser to read.amazon.com/notebook to see all the highlights you’ve saved on Kindle. Navigate to the book you want. Your highlights and notes appear in a list. Use Evernote’s free Web Clipper browser extension to save your highlights to a new note in Evernote. You can give the note a title, choose which notebook you want to save it to, and tag it by topic. Start a reading journal Chances are you’ve already used Evernote to take notes on something you’ve read. Put a little structure around those notes and you can build a journal that makes your thoughts easier to refer to in the future. Inspired by the one-page book report forms you may have used in elementary school, we’ve put together a template that you can use to record book details, important ideas, things you want to look up later, and more: Download the Book Journal template » Chapter 2: Evernote for Writers If you’re not just reading books but also writing your own, the number of things to manage is even higher. Many authors build Evernote into their workflows, from initial brainstorming to tracking manuscript submissions. You can attach Word docs to a note or link to Google Drive files, so your draft is only a click away from your notes—or you could just write it all in Evernote to begin with. Capture your ideas As any writer knows, inspiration can strike at any time, and the Muse tends to show up when it’s least convenient. But with Evernote at your side, you can get ideas out of your head and safely written down whether you’re at home, in the office, or on the move . Keep a notebook in Evernote just for ideas and create a shortcut so that notebook is easy to get to. Use Evernote on your phone to scan your handwritten notes—when you search for words in those images later on, Evernote will find them. You can even record audio directly into Evernote for a hands-free brainstorming session. All of your ideas will be waiting for you whenever and wherever you need them. Collect your research Whether you’re writing fiction, a memoir, or a dissertation, research is essential. When Amy Stewart wrote her bestselling novel Girl Waits With Gun, she collected thousands of newspaper clippings, photos, and files . But by keeping them all in Evernote, she was able to keep them organized at her fingertips. Evernote’s Web Clipper is a must for gathering research online. Use it to save web pages, articles, specific passages, images, and PDFs. You can also organize them instantly into any notebook or tagging system you like. Which begs the question: how should you organize all that material? Everyone has their own preferred system. Maybe a neat array of notebooks and stacks are your thing. Perhaps you prefer a tag for every possible topic. Whatever your style, we have some ideas to get you started . Plan your novel If you’re tackling a novel, research is only one element of a dizzying array of information to manage. You’ll also have to wrangle plot outlines, character traits, motivations, settings, timelines, and more. But don’t worry, we have your back. To help make sure you’ve covered all the bases, we’ve put together a dozen templates explicitly designed for novel-writing projects. From working through a premise to building a fictional world, you’ll find everything you need to start organizing your thoughts. Get the Creative Writing templates » Epilogue Virginia Woolf famously wrote that “books are the mirrors of the soul.” In a similar way, Evernote is a mirror of your mind. Let your notes reflect your literary life, and every book you encounter can become a part of your ever-growing repository of knowledge, adventure, and inspiration.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "6 Ways to Make Your Commute More Productive", "author": ["Emily Esposito"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/6-ways-to-make-your-commute-more-productive/", "abstract": "Whether you drive, bus, bike, walk, or segway to work, the average American spends more than 100 hours a year commuting. That’s more than the average two-week vacation. Who would consciously choose a car over sunny Croatia? No one. All those hours add up. For example, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were a little more than 139 million workers commuting in 2014. At an average of 26 minutes each way to work, five days a week, 50 weeks a year, that works out to 29.6 billion hours, 1.2 billion days, or 3.4 million years spent commuting in one year. With that amount of time, you could have built the Great Pyramid of Giza 26 times. Or at least complete one New York Times crossword puzzle. Instead, you’re waiting for the bus or stuck at a red light. Until teleportation becomes a reality, your commute is unavoidable. It’s a chore, but it can also be an opportunity if you change your thinking, stop scrolling through Instagram, and use that time to get a jumpstart on your day. Here are six ways to make your commute more productive: 1. Create your to-do list If you’re not driving into the office, take some commute time to jot down your top three to five priorities for the day. Make sure they are specific and realistic. For example, if you are working on a website redesign, break up that big to-do item into smaller priorities each day, like mocking up the new navigation one day and working on the homepage the next. Creating this to-do list helps you focus your time and energy where it really matters, instead of trying to accomplish many small, unrelated tasks throughout the day. Evernote tip: You can also record audio directly into Evernote , so you can capture your to-do list safely while at the wheel. 2. Find your inner zen Sneak in some meditation to help you start your day calm and refreshed (as long as you’re not operating something with wheels). Apps like Headspace or Calm offer guided meditation sessions on topics ranging from sleep to focus. Calm even offers a session specifically for commutes. Even just a few minutes of meditation can reduce stress and improve concentration, focus, and memory. And remember, you don’t always need an app to realize these benefits. Disconnect completely and let your mind wander, but remember your stop! 3. Mix up your mode of transportation It’s easy to fall into a commuting pattern — grabbing your car keys, walking the same five blocks to the bus stop, or clipping on your helmet. While it may add more time to your journey, consider breaking up your routine. This not only provides a change of scenery, it may also help boost creativity . By changing up your strict morning routine, you’ll allow your brain to naturally unwind, creating the perfect environment for creative thinking. Do you usually commute by car? Try mapping out a biking or walking route for a change and get a workout in at the same time. Is your commute route popular, as in crowded? Try finding a vanpool to meet new people or take the bus to have some quiet time to recharge. 4. Brainstorm fresh ideas The bus or train may not seem like a calm oasis, but in reality, it is completely free of interruptions. You won’t have to worry about coworkers coming up to your desk, rogue meetings, or any of the many obligations of family life. It’s just you, your device or notebook, and the journey. Take advantage of this time to focus and tap into your creativity. Are you a writer or artist? You can find endless inspiration from people watching or taking in the places you pass through on the bus or train. If inspiration doesn’t strike right away, that’s okay. Use your commute as a time to open up and hone your power of observation. You never know when something will pop up later in your work. 5. Listen to a great story If you get motion sickness while reading in a bus or haven’t quite figured out how to read while driving (we’re joking, please don’t try this), podcasts may be your new best friend. If you’re looking for ideas and best practices to organize your work and declutter your life, check out our podcast, Taking Note . For inspiration, listen to Rad Awakenings with Khe Hy, where Khe hosts conversations with a diverse list of successful business people, many of whom, in spite of their outward success, feel unfulfilled. They share stories of personal growth and the lessons they’ve learned. For career motivation, tune into Lead to Win with Michael Hyatt. Drawn from his years of experience as a CEO and motivation speaker, Michael shares stories on how to organize your busy life and become a better leader. Want some more podcast recommendations? We have several . 6. Avoid the commute altogether The easiest way to have a great commute? Avoid it completely! Join the 70% of employees globally who work from home at least once a week and shorten your commute to that handful of steps from your bedroom to your office. Of course, not all of us have the option of working from home. Some things simply can’t be done away from the workplace. But if you do have the option, just think of everything better suited to a work-from-home day: writing a guest post for your company’s blog, taking a training to add to your skills, listening to a TED talk for motivation — the list is endless. It’s time to reframe your commute You commute to get from point A to point B, but it can be so much more than that. Try to reframe the definition of your commute and look at it in a more positive light. That time may be the only part of your day when you are truly alone. You’re surrounded by coworkers in the office and go home to your family or roommates. Those are all positives, but the downside is that your brain is always on. By being alone and really appreciating that solitude, your mind can relax, recharge, and explore new territory.", "date": "2018-07-19,"},

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Medal-Worthy Success: 3 Inspiring Tips from Top Athletes", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/inspiring-tips-from-top-athletes/", "abstract": "In many ways, to be human is to strive. We want to go farther, to climb higher, to create or do something extraordinary that will live on in history. Those dreams change with time; most of us do not grow up to be the astronauts or movie stars we imagined. So we strive in new, more grounded ways: testing our mettle at the gym, through artistic expression, or in our daily work. But tending our inner fires can be tricky. Success takes grit and courage, especially when deadlines loom or life drops obstacles in our path. It also takes more than a little inspiration. Right now, the world’s best winter athletes have gathered for two weeks of elite competition in PyeongChang, South Korea. What’s more inspiring than watching as these elite competitors push their bodies and minds to the limit? Or seeing a lifetime of training finally pay off with a coveted gold medal? In that same spirit of striving, here are three tips from the world of sport that are worthy of medals in their own right. Each of these insights can help you define, focus on, and reach your goals like a champion. Bronze Medal “You become what you think about and focus on the most. See yourself attracting the things you want to accomplish. Thoughts and desires in your mind can become a reality.” — Jonathan Toews Ice hockey star Jonathan Toews is still in the prime of his career, but he already has two gold medals with the Canadian national squad to go along with three championship rings as captain of the NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks. So he knows a thing or two about finding success with a team. Toews’ quote invokes the so-called “Law of Attraction.” But even if you don’t believe in the notion that visualizing an outcome can make it happen, there’s no doubt that finding focus is a good first step to achieving any goal. Here are some more exercises that can help: Reframe your goals. As motivational expert Michael Hyatt explains, “we tend to experience what we expect.” So it’s important to structure goals in such a way that we can truly believe in our capacity to make them real. Hold on to the things that inspire you: Create an inspiration notebook to capture images, articles, and other things you find online, so they’re always handy when you need them most. Begin collecting your ideas, reading, and observations in a “commonplace” notebook . This centuries-old practice gathers messy thoughts into an ever-growing repository of personal wisdom that you can draw upon anytime. Silver Medal “Winning doesn’t always mean being first. Winning means you’re doing better than you’ve ever done before.” — Bonnie Blair American speed skater Bonnie Blair came in first quite a lot during her career. She’s among the most decorated women in the history of winter sports, earning five gold medals and a bronze between 1984 and 1994. But she also understands that there are many different kinds of winning, and that’s an important lesson for us all. Blair’s insight about “doing better” can be a powerful motivational tool. Nobody gets everything they want. Some level of failure is inevitable in any large effort. But if we keep striving to reach a personal best, and learn to channel our frustrations into resolve, we can transform “maybe-someday” fantasies into real accomplishments. That starts with being more aware of the steps we take: Treat your life as a series of experiments. Look at it this way: you can invest all your energy in an ideal and quit when things don’t go the way you expected. Or you can work to develop a growth mindset , learning from your failures so you’ll do better in your next attempt. As you experiment, take careful notes of your process . The more detail you can capture along the way, the easier it will be to analyze a failure or duplicate a success. It’s all part of using your notes as a tool for growth. Gold Medal “Dreams are free. Goals have a cost: time, effort, sacrifice, and sweat. How will you pay for your goals?” — Usain Bolt No, he isn’t a winter athlete, but who are we to neglect a tip from Usain Bolt? By the time he retired from competition in 2017, the Jamaican superstar had carved out a permanent place in the annals of sport. He’s the greatest sprinter of all time and an eight-time gold medalist. But even Bolt’s unearthly talent on the track had to be developed. He underperformed and struggled with injuries in his early years, only rising to his potential when he combined a renewed sense of purpose with intense training to improve his technique. Of course, few people are as naturally gifted as Usain Bolt, who made achieving the impossible look effortless. But no matter how difficult the goals you’ve set for yourself, you can reduce some of the friction by planning carefully and tracking your progress: Get clear on what it is you want out of life and commit to making those things your priority. The GTD process is a great way to begin by organizing and ranking your projects and to-dos. Forget about “someday” and start making progress today . And the next day, and the next. Because over time, those small steps can add up to big success. Keep track of what you’ve accomplished each day, no matter how small. Few things are as motivating as seeing how far you’ve already come. While you’re rooting for your favorites in PyeongChang, think about the struggles that got them there. What can their success teach you about following your own dreams? Capture those insights in a note, and refer to it the next time you find yourself in a slump. Let those thoughts lift you up, and before you know it, you’ll be ready to get back into the game.", "date": "2018-02-8,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "6 Ways to Automate Simple Work Tasks", "author": ["Emily Esposito"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/6-ways-to-automate-simple-work-tasks/", "abstract": "Buried under emails, expense reports, meeting requests, and dozens of other administrative tasks, everyone has that little voice in their heads wishing their to-do list could vanish or magically get completed for them. With automation, that wish may be granted. Take Reddit user FiletOfFish1066 . In 2016, he claimed to have automated his entire job as a programmer: “In the past six years I have maybe done 50 hours of real work,” he admitted. “So basically nothing.” While it may sound like he was living the dream, he actually forgot how to code and eventually got fired. If there is one thing that FiletOfFish1066 can teach us, it’s that automation can be a powerful way to save time at work (though obviously it should never be a replacement for actually doing your job). How automation can help you work faster All those three-minute tasks you repeat throughout the day take a toll on your productivity. You may find yourself creatively spent, unable to come up with new ideas or see things from a different perspective. Or, you may just burn out and look for shortcuts, which can lead to mistakes, recklessness, or avoidance. This mental strain has a name: decision fatigue . The more choices you make, the harder each one becomes for your brain. Automation can free up your time and mental energy to focus on things that matter. Instead of thinking about how to respond to an email, you can brainstorm impactful ways you can improve your product, service, or customer experience. Here are six ways to automate simple work tasks: 1. Sort and respond to emails On average, workers receive 200 emails each day and spend two and a half hours reading and replying to those emails. It’s no wonder that inbox zero has become the ultimate goal, and with some easy automation tricks, it seems more attainable. First, set up smart labels in Gmail or rules in Outlook to automatically sort emails you receive based on sender or keywords. Even better: if you’re an Evernote Premium user, you can automatically forward your emails into Evernote so relevant messages stay alongside related notes. For those emails that only need a quick response or acknowledgement, create email templates and canned responses so you’re not typing, “Sounds good!” or “That works for me” every time. And lastly, use Boomerang , a Gmail plugin, to schedule email responses so you don’t need to remember to follow up. 2. Proofread your work in real time How embarssing is it to make a typo in an email, blog post, or (gasp) on your website? Keyboard slips are all too common, and while you can have coworkers proofread important content, they probably don’t have time to edit every single thing you write. Browser extensions like Grammarly and After the Deadline automatically correct mistakes like contextual spelling errors, incorrect grammar, or poor vocabulary usage. For more complex proofreading, the Hemingway App identifies long, complex sentences, weak phrases, passive voice, and more. 3. Save time scouring the news Something as simple as reading the morning news can quickly turn into a black hole of current events. Instead of tracking down relevant stories, have them come to you. Flipboard’s Smart Magazines learn what you like based on your reading habits and automatically compile stories specifically for you in the app. TheSkimm delivers a daily digest of top headlines into your inbox with a fun and quirky twist. For more customized news, set up a Google Alert with the keyword you want to monitor. Then, set up a filter in Gmail to automatically forward the message to a dedicated notebook in your Evernote account, where you can read it at your leisure. 4. Leverage AI to schedule meetings for you You don’t need to wait until you get the corner office to have an executive assistant. AI assistants Amy and Andrew , created by x.ai, schedule all your meetings for you, saving you the endless back-and-forth that easily drains hours each day. There’s nothing to download — simply CC Amy in an email and she will look at your calendar, email with your guest, and send a meeting invite to both of you. Amy can also help you remember your doctor’s appointment or coworker’s birthday. All you need to do is email Amy with the date, time, and details of the reminder, and she’ll block off your calendar. 5. Create custom automation rules Wouldn’t it be great if all your favorite apps talked to each other? With tools like Zapier and IFTTT , you can connect and automate your apps with just a few clicks. With Zapier, you can search for your favorite apps ( like Evernote ), and choose from a list of “Zaps” (integrations), or create your own workflow. For example, creating Trello cards from Evernote notes or creating Google Calendar events from Evernote reminders. IFTTT also lets you search for pre-built integrations, called Applets, or create your own. To extend Evernote , you could create a draft in Gmail when you add a new note, sync new notes in a notebook to Google Drive, create a draft post in WordPress when you add a new note, and more. 6. Build custom workflows for repetitive computer tasks Think of that coworker who knows so many computer shortcuts that he or she seems to be using a completely different machine from everyone else. While you may not be that sort of power user, you can get one step closer with custom workflows. Automator is a tool included in OS X that allows you to automate tasks on your Mac, without needing to learn any programming. With a list of built-in actions, you can quickly create workflows for repetitive tasks like changing file names, resizing images, or backing up important files. For Windows users, there’s the built-in Windows Task Scheduler . You can create a basic task, select the frequency of that task, and identify the trigger. For example, you could open the same programs each time you log on or delete all files in a folder that are older than one month. Automation will continue to redefine your job (and that’s a good thing) Automation is a touchy subject for some people — there’s always the looming fear that someday, robots will come and take your job. There’s no question that automation will continue to change how you work, but it will likely redefine your job — not eliminate it. According to a 2017 report by the McKinsey Global Institute , increasing automation means that new jobs will be created, existing roles will be redefined, and you may even have the opportunity to switch careers entirely. And, if you do get to the point where you never have to schedule a meeting or respond to an email again, well, that’s just an added benefit.", "date": "2018-07-5,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "You Don’t Have to Be a Genius to Be Creative", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/dont-genius-creative/", "abstract": "Are you a creative person? Chances are, you said you aren’t. We’ve been conditioned to believe that creativity is the sole domain of geniuses, a kind of divine inspiration that is beyond the reach of ordinary people. But the common perception of creativity is largely based on myth and legend. Allen Gannett , CEO of TrackMaven and author of “ The Creative Curve: How to Develop the Right Idea at the Right Time ,” dug into the science and history of creative achievement and found a surprising pattern. According to Allen, it’s not about genius at all. Hard work, good timing, and strong feedback matter a lot more, and those are skills which can be learned, practiced, and repeated. We sat down with Allen to explore this concept in the latest episode of Taking Note: Conversations with Evernote . Listen below or read on for some highlights from our conversation. Taking Note: S2 E5 — Riding the Creative Curve with Allen Gannett http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-S2E5-Allen-Gannett.mp3 Length: 39 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS Selected Highlights We tend to think of creativity as specifically referring to art. But there are all sorts of creative acts. A scientific breakthrough that you arrive at through your intellect, that’s a creative act. A new business venture is a creative act. So what in your view is creativity? How do we define a piece of work as being creative? It’s actually one of the most challenging questions. If I paint something and I throw a bunch of paint on a canvas, you wouldn’t say it’s creative. But if Picasso did the same thing, you’d probably say it’s creative. So what does creativity mean? It’s kind of like that famous Supreme Court case about pornography. How do you know what’s obscene or not obscene? They said, “Well, you know it when you see it.” And creativity is much the same. But there’s actually a really great definition that academics have come to. When you’re talking about creativity, what you’re really talking about is the ability to make things that are both novel and valuable. Novel and valuable. When I throw paint on a canvas it’s certainly novel but it’s not valuable. I recently learned how to do conditional color formatting in Excel. That’s certainly valuable, but it’s definitely not novel and it’s certainly not creative. So what creativity really is, is the ability to create things that are both novel and valuable. Now, the challenge that leaves for people who want to be creative is that value is a subjective statement. For something to be valuable, we all have to agree it’s valuable. And so, as a result, creativity is actually a social construct. If you created a novel and no-one ever read it, are you creative? It’s actually impossible to prove that you are, because lots of people create novels that aren’t creative. And the only way we know whether or not it’s creative is whether or not other people deem it creative. There’s a circular logic that falls into place. The book is called “The Creative Curve: How to Develop the Right Idea, at the Right Time.” The creative curve is a concept in the book about the interplay between novelty, familiarity, and timing. Can you explain that briefly? It really boils down at a foundational level to the fact that we have these two contradictory urges. We have this one urge which is that we’re always looking for things that are familiar. And the reason why is that we crave safety. So if you were a prehistoric cave dweller, if you saw two different caves and one cave is a cave that you sleep in every night, and the other cave is a cave you’ve never been in before, your body goes, “Oh, that cave is unfamiliar. It doesn’t feel safe. This one that I’ve seen lots and lots of times, that’s a safe cave. I’m going to go and sleep there.” But we also have this other desire. We also have this part of us that’s novelty-seeking. And that’s because we’re also wired to find new sources of reward, new sources of energy, new sources of food. So if you were a forager, you’re also constantly looking for where the next meal is going to come from. Now, what’s interesting about these two urges is that they’re an inherent contradiction. We like things that are both familiar and we like things that are novel. Where it starts to make sense is when you realize that this is your brain’s really elegant way of balancing risk and reward. It turns out that as consumers and as humans, we like things that are at this balance of familiarity and novel. They’re familiar with a novel twist. Your job as a creator is to create ideas that have that right blend of familiarity and novelty. Basically what that means is that when you first see something you might not like it very much. And the more you see it, the more you like it. Up until a point. At a certain point, your novelty-seeking wins out and then you like it less and less each additional time you’re exposed to it. You get bored. Think about the new Drake song. Maybe the first you heard it you’re like, “Ah, this is not good.” The fifth time, “Well, this is nice. It’s hard to tell really if I like this, but maybe I’m getting bored.” And the twentieth time you’re like, “Please, never play this song again.” And so you see this bell curve relationship between exposure and preference. And for the book, I call that concept the creative curve because I think it’s a little easier to say. And it really underlies what your task as a creator is. Your job as a creator is to create ideas that have that right blend of familiarity and novelty. I get what you’re saying, but if we are relying on the acceptance of the masses to tell us whether or not we’re being creative, is that really a good measure of creativity? I look at the TV ratings or the Top 40 and I think maybe it isn’t a good measure. Great question. One of the things I talk about in the book is that this creative curve phenomenon, it happens at an individual level, a group level, and a population level. And so what this means is when we talk about things being labeled creative, it doesn’t have to be labeled so by mainstream culture. For something to be labeled creative it has to be accepted. But it doesn’t matter the group size. I would personally argue, and this is a more esoteric discussion, that obviously the fine artists who art critics say are creative, they are creative. But I would also argue a lot of musicians that create these things that are loved by many people are also creative. And I think that’s very hard to sometimes acknowledge in the present. But when we look to the past, a lot of us would say, well, Led Zeppelin was creative or the Beatles were creative. They were pop musicians at the time, right? Your grandparents said the Beatles weren’t creative. That’s a really good point, I think. You know, with every new musical movement there’s some group of people who says, “That’s not music.” Not just “that’s not creative” but that’s not even music. Right. So we’re all familiar with this inspiration theory of creativity. The flash of genius, the eureka moment. But one of the central arguments that you make in the book is that this is a myth, specifically the notion that creativity is confined to genius. So where did that notion come from? In the book I spend a chapter breaking down the history of creativity and genius over time, and how they interplay and how they’re intertwined. What makes a poet? What makes an artist? Are artists special? Are they not? And it’s changed over time. So, for example, in the medieval era artists weren’t actually viewed as valuable. They were viewed as lowly craftspeople who merely created basic works of art that were used as symbols in churches and this kind of thing. A lot of the changes around how creativity is viewed are intertwined with economics. So in periods of great riches, we tend to raise the social capital of creatives. As their work becomes something more people can afford and more people pursue, there’s a supply and demand thing that comes in. Genius has become correlated with creativity, but it’s not always been in a good way. So, for example, in the 1800s genius was actually viewed as a negative thing. The person with the most social capital was the so-called average man. […] Right now, we’re on this entrepreneur kick where we’re putting Elon Musk on covers of magazines. Elon Musk literally has thousands and thousands of rocket scientists and car R&D people who work for him. He’s not going off in a cabin by himself. But right now that’s our media perception of creativity. Elon Musk is Iron Man, he’s Tony Stark, he’s doing all these things by himself. And it’s just so comically untrue. This notion of the individual, solo genius is sort of the most prominent part of the creativity story. And it’s also wrong. So many of the historical figures who we now consider to be geniuses were underappreciated in their own time. And now it seems like we’re trying to overcompensate by actively searching out people who we can proclaim to be geniuses. I think it actually has a lot to do with capitalism, especially in America where we all like the idea that certain people are able to go from nothing to something. That notion is appealing to us, the idea that’s there this sort of individual hero. And I think it’s unfortunate, because one of the things I talk about in the book is that since creativity is a social phenomenon, there’s actually a huge role that other people play in your creative process. And I break down four different types of people that all the creative geniuses I interviewed had in that role. One of them is what I call the Prominent Promoter. All these creatives had someone more senior than them, more well-known than them, who lent them credibility. In academics you see this with senior researchers giving credit to junior researchers. With music, you see that bands have opening acts. Over and over again in all creative fields you see this passing on of credibility. And that’s so important because if creativity is a social phenomenon you need people to give you the time of day. And one of the ways to get that is to borrow it from someone else. In the book, you deconstruct some of the mythology that has grown up around some of the creative geniuses that we adore. Mozart, Michelangelo, and Darwin are three. And you point out how the stories that we have received about these people are largely incorrect. But even if the stories that we think we know about these people aren’t true, they have left us legacies that are so rich that they’re household names after centuries. So where did those superlative outputs come from, if not from genius? It really tells us the power of the media and storytelling. Mozart is perhaps the most interesting example.  A lot of our current narrative around Mozart can trace back to two things. More recently, the movie Amadeus in 1985 won eight Academy Awards including Best Picture. It made over $200 million in the box office, over $600 million when you adjust it for inflation. This was a popular movie. And in the movie, Mozart is portrayed as literally a little kid, blindfolded, playing piano for the Pope. They say things like, you know, he wrote his first concerto at four, opera at six, something else at eight, blah, blah, blah. And here’s the problem. That is nowhere near true. we all want to believe in this idea of the god-like hero. It’s a compelling idea but it’s just not true. The real story of Mozart is when he was three years old he had what we would now consider a helicopter dad who told him,  “I love you but you need to become the world’s greatest musician. And to do that, I’m going to hire the best music teachers in all of Europe to teach you music.” He wrote his first original music, not when he was four. When he was 17. Now, you may say, well, that’s still pretty impressive. But that’s after 14 years of practicing three hours every single day with some of the best music teachers in all of Europe. Then, what’s even crazier to me, one of the big, strong myths around Mozart is this idea that he would compose music in his head, away from a piano. He would only go to a piece of paper to write the finished piece of music and it would have no mistakes, no edits. And this traces back to a letter supposedly written by Mozart that was published in the early 1800s. The problem is this letter was forged. A music magazine publisher named Johann Rochlitz, who basically wanted to sell magazines and wanted to prop up Mozart ’cause he was a fan, he literally forged this letter. You see this again and again when you start deconstructing these stories, because we all want to believe in this idea of the god-like hero. It’s a compelling idea but it’s just not true. If we dial a bit down from absolute genius, do you believe that there’s a creative type? I believe that there are learnable, nurturable personality traits that help creativity. When you look at studies around what’s correlated to creative potential, the things which often come up are things like openness. Openness is not hereditary. It’s nurtured. You can learn to be more open, you can practice becoming more open, you can change the type of people you have around you. These are not fixed things. There’s also all these really fascinating studies that look at the relationship between IQ and creativity. And over and over again what you find is that IQ really has no bearing on creative potential. And so then the question for us is, well, if that’s true how do we unlock it? That’s what the second half of the book goes into. So when people make that complaint that we talked about at the beginning, “Oh, I’m not creative,” do you think they’re comparing themselves to this genius archetype or are they thinking about talent or aptitude? They’re comparing themselves to the genius archetype but they’re using it as an excuse. When we look at how easy we think it is for Mozart, and we think how hard it is for us, we go, “Well, it’s not easy for me so I just must not be creative.” And we forget, partly because of this mythology that has been created,  that it wasn’t easy for Mozart either. And the other thing is that we really underestimate our ability to become talented at things. If you want to have a really big epiphany at your laptop, go on YouTube and search for videos before and after voice lessons. There’s this whole genre on YouTube of people singing and then 12 months later singing after they took voice lessons. And it’s amazing. I mean, people go from having like the worst voices ever to having these beautiful voices. When you talk about something like the story of Mozart, or when I think about someone like John Coltrane or Sonny Rollins practicing the saxophone hour after hour after hour, I know there are people out there listening to this and the first that is popping into their head is, “ah, 10,000 hours.” But as you point out in the book, that is also not quite true. Oh, God. Yeah. So the 10,000 hours principle has become this sort of mantra in self-help. There’s lots of articles written about the 10,000 hours principle and how if you just practice, practice, practice, you can create anything. It’s based on the research by a researcher named K. Anders Ericsson who is one of the foremost researchers on it. But what his paper actually says is not that if you practice 10,000 hours at anything you’ll get better at it. It says something different. One, it says that 10,000 hours is the average across people and across skills. Different people take different amounts of time so, yes, anyone can get better at anything but it takes different people different amounts of time. And it also depends on the skills. There’s not some magical thing in your brain which when you hit 10,000 hours it goes, “Great job.” Here’s the second issue: the paper says that it’s 10,000 hours on average of something called deliberate practice . And deliberate practice is a very specific type of practice that’s outlined in pedagogy. It’s breaking down a skill into very, very small increments and practicing that small piece of skill over and over again. So let me give you an example. Probably everyone listening to the podcast drives. And you’ve probably driven 10,000 hours. But I can promise you, you’re not a NASCAR driver. And the reason why is that as we do something more and more, it starts becoming automatic. It’s becoming subconscious. It’s why when you’re commuting you just sort of lose track of time and all of a sudden you’re at your location. You’re not actually thinking about what you’re doing. if you wanted to become a NASCAR driver, what you would do is you would take the skill of driving and you’d break it down into these tiny little tasks. You’d say, “Okay, I’m going to practice high speed left turns over and over and over again. And only once I get great at that will I then practice high speed right turns.” You see this with basketball players. Basketball players will practice mid-court, left-handed dribbling over and over and over and over again. So if you want to become great at something, it turns out it’s not about practice. Rote practice actually will just make you keep doing whatever you’re doing more and more subconsciously. Okay, so now that we have hopefully demolished some notions that people can’t be creative, or that you, that you have to be some sort of amazing genius demigod to, to have creative thoughts, how do we generate fresh ideas and how do we judge if they’re any good? In the back half of the book I explain four things you can do to nurture and be really intentional about your creativity. And one of the things that I found that was surprising to me was all these creatives I interviewed had very systematic processes for getting feedback. For example, Ben & Jerry’s, the ice cream company. I had the fun experience of spending a day with the Ben & Jerry’s flavor team, and really digging into understanding how they come up with a new flavor. These are people who spend literally their entire career thinking about ice cream. And what they don’t do is come up with ideas and say, “Great, we have it.” Every year they come up with a list of 200 ideas. And they send an email survey to their customers. And for each of these ideas they ask two questions. One, how likely are you to buy this flavor? And two, how unique is this flavor? Or, basically, how familiar is it and how novel is it? The truth is that all these creatives spend a huge amount of time listening. That’s one of the most important things you can do if you want to be successful at creative tasks. And what they’ve found is they have to find a balance of those two things. Because if it’s just how likely are you to buy it, well, you’ll end up with all these very familiar flavors and all of a sudden, every Ben & Jerry’s ice cream will be the same thing. And if they only focused on how unique it is, they’d end up with all these weird flavors no one wants to buy. So they use data, pretty lo-fi data, to learn what their audience will like, where these ideas fall on the creative curve. Because they want to get ideas that are the right blend. But there’s even more subtle ways. I had this meta-experience writing the book. And I know a lot of Evernote users are writers, so I’m sure you can relate. You’re writing these words and then you have external readers, maybe your agents reading it, your editors reading it, your copy editors reading it, your proofreaders reading it. All these people are giving you feedback and you’re iterating it. And that’s what makes it go from okay to good to hopefully great. That feedback is so important. So, yes, we mythologize the idea of a creative genius who just creates things from their own brain, and then they’re done. But the truth is that all these creatives spend a huge amount of time listening . That’s one of the most important things you can do if you want to be successful at creative tasks. So what’s one thing that someone can do today, right at this minute, to start unlocking their own creative potential? One of the things I found from the creatives that I interviewed is that all of them went very, very, very deep in their information consumption on a very, very narrow band of information. They weren’t reading all of Twitter, they weren’t reading all of Facebook, they’re not generalists. In fact, from a count and consumption perspective, you’d say they’re maladjusted. But if you want to become really great at something specific, you have to consume that much information about it because it lets you understand what is familiar and what is overexposed. In the book, I tell the story of Ted Sarandos, who’s the chief content officer of Netflix. Been there for 18 years, overseen their entire successful strategy of getting into original programming. And he started his career as literally a video store clerk who decided he would watch every single movie in the store. And that’s what gave him the ability to have taste. By understanding the corpus, what’s out there, what would be familiar, you understand what’s going to be too new, too familiar and just right. And that’s something that you can start doing today. And usually it doesn’t cost anything. Allen Gannett is CEO of TrackMaven, a leading marketing analytics firm.

Finally writing that book you’ve had inside you for years? Launching a podcast? Performing stand-up comedy in front of an adoring crowd? Whatever your aspiration, this can be the year you take positive steps toward making it a reality. As scary as it might be to think about what lies ahead, big goals don’t always demand big actions. Often, all you need to achieve your dreams is a series of small, incremental steps, a firm belief that you can do it—and the right tool to capture moments of inspiration. Henry Ford famously said , “Whether you think you can or whether you think you can’t, you’re right.” One way to ‘fail-proof’ your dreams is by identifying and removing some of the familiar excuses that have held you back for so long. Self-defeating words like “I’m too busy,” or “I can never remember my good ideas” do nothing but rob you of your power and place obstacles in your path. Making Evernote your place to stay on track and keep yourself accountable can help. To inspire you to make your 2018 happen, here are some unexpected ways that creative minds use Evernote Premium to help them capture brilliant ideas, no matter where they are in the world. Superfeel finds inspiration in the everyday Musicians Androu Boudreau and Jordan Bradley, the two halves of up-and-coming New York-based pop/R&B duo Superfeel , use Evernote as an integral part of their creative process. As Androu says, “Evernote is critical to our creative brainstorming process. It helps us capture ideas at all times, no matter where we are. We capture ideas through voice recordings, notes, pictures, and more, and can come back and bring them all together to make music.” The magic of Superfeel is the way they can find inspiration in the most unlikely of places. An image, a sound, a thought—any snippet of an idea can later form the basis of a work of art, so being able to capture it all in Evernote is vital to the duo. “Every song we have ever recorded, Evernote has had a hand in the process,” Androu explains. “This app has literally changed the way we make music.” Pro Tip: Record audio interviews ‘on the street’ for your podcast. Nisha Harish conquered the desert and captured her journey in Evernote In 2015, Nisha Harish completed the grueling six-day, 156-mile (251 km) annual race across the Moroccan desert known as the Marathon des Sables . Competitors must carry everything they need with them, so there’s no room for luxuries. Despite this, Nisha made sure to pack her iPhone so that she could take notes in Evernote at the end of each day. Upon completing the race, she turned those notes into a successful book, Big Steps, Long Strides , about her experience. Nisha explains , “I wanted to write a book, but it needed to fit into my lifestyle. Evernote gave me that flexibility.” And considering that she had to carry her note-taking device across the burning desert with her, it’s fair to say that, without Evernote in her pack, Nisha might not have realized her goal. “It would be too simplistic to say that Evernote allows people to make notes because it has allowed me to achieve a major life ambition.” Pro Tip: Jot down story ideas for your novel while you’re commuting to and from work. Aaron Mahnke turns research into creative inspiration Aaron Mahnke is a best-selling author and the host and producer of Lore, the critically-acclaimed series which began as a podcast and has now expanded into television , a book series , and a national live tour. Aaron’s many creative projects take up an enormous amount of his time; that’s why the ability to capture ideas in Evernote is vital to his success. “Writing is creative, yes, but it’s also work. It’s just a task,” Aaron says . And to complete any task, you need the right tools. For a long time, Evernote was the place where Aaron stored links, images, notes, scraps, and ideas in clearly-labeled notebooks. It was what he called a “someday box.” Now, however, it fuels his ongoing creative process. To produce Lore, Aaron uses a gamut of Evernote features, from Web Clipper, marking up PDFs, and tagging, to multi-layered, interconnected notebook stacks that tie together all the elements of his research and writing. “It’s a process that sounds simple on paper,” Aaron says. “I pick a topic I find interesting, and then research every aspect of it that I can. I read for hours, taking notes and highlighting pieces of story or information. And when I’ve filled my head with everything, I find a quiet place and think through the outline. A lot of that happens in Evernote.” Pro Tip: Save a PDF or doc in Evernote, annotate it, and search the text inside it later. Forrest Dylan Bryant is always ready to write with Evernote Full disclosure: Forrest is more than just an Evernote Premium customer, he’s also our Director of Marketing Content. So, if anyone understands the true creative potential of Evernote, it’s Forrest. In his spare time (what little of it he has), Forrest is an accomplished author and an avid participant in the National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo , held every November. NaNoWriMo challenges participants to write a 50,000-word novel in 30 days—a difficult goal, certainly, but not an impossible one, although it demands a disciplined and highly organized creative approach from writers. Forrest muses that over the years he has experimented with many different writing tools. “Word, Scrivener, Google Docs, Ulysses…I’ve used them all. Each has its strengths, but I couldn’t find a system that suited me.” So, when he was preparing for NaNoWriMo in 2015 (and again in 2016), Forrest made the decision to create his novel entirely in Evernote. While you may not want to make it your sole writing tool, you can still take advantage of Evernote’s many templates and shortcuts to make the planning process considerably easier. The work of preparing to write, including creating character histories and story timelines, can stymie even the most seasoned writer. Templates simplify this process by giving you a convenient home for all the material you collect while researching your story. Then, when the time comes to create your ‘magnum opus’—using whatever tool you choose—you’ll find it easier to stay on track when you refer back to the research you’ve stored handily in Evernote. If writing a novel is one of your 2018 goals, NaNoWriMo could be the perfect place to start —to ‘dip your toe in the water’ and see if the writer’s life is really for you. Pro Tip: See Forrest’s advice for using templates to write your novel here . So, what will you achieve this year? As you can see, there’s no stopping a great idea—at least not when you have the right tools to help you.", "date": "2018-01-29,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Make 2018 Your Year to Do Big Things", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/make-2018-your-year-to-do-big-things/", "abstract": "We’re ushering in a new year; break out the champagne and celebrate! But this is also a great time to reflect and survey the months ahead. What do you want to do with them? If this is your year to do big things, your goals might include improving your health, acquiring a new skill or habit, or even writing a book or starting that winning blog. But as many of us know, making a resolution to change is one thing. Making those changes stick is another. Research has shown that we abandon one-third of all new year’s resolutions within the first month, and fewer than half survive to the six-month mark. Can we do better than that? Of course. Here’s how. According to experts in psychology and productivity, there are three keys to making resolutions that stick: Be smarter about how you make resolutions. Choose the right goals for the right reasons. Implement new behaviors in ways that make it likely you’ll turn them into habits. Plan how you’ll find the willpower and support to stay motivated and on track. Step 1: Get SMART Let’s start with the resolutions themselves. It’s not enough to have a good idea. Your idea also has to be actionable and attainable. Sociologist Christine Whelan described a well-crafted resolution as “SMART”—it’s specific, measurable, and achievable , there’s a reward for sticking with it, and we can track our progress throughout the year. Just as importantly, you have to want it. Whether you’re trying to lose weight or write a novel , you’re more likely to stick with difficult projects when the motivation comes from within. Step 2: Get in the habit Another reason resolutions fall apart is that we try to take on too much at once. Going after too many difficult goals at the same time can leave you burned out. To maximize your chances of success, choose just one resolution. Start with the easiest one. You wouldn’t try to run a marathon if you’ve never run a mile, would you? The same applies to willpower and self-control. The idea is to focus, not on the goal, but on the habits that get you there. To do big things, you have to start with tiny ones, so start small and work your way up. Productivity expert Tiago Forte suggests treating your habits like experiments , where you are in control. “Know what it is you want to change,” he says. “Choose a behavior that you think will work. You have to think of small things that make the habit you want to develop more interesting.” He suggests making small changes into a game to challenge yourself, such as seeing how many different, positive ways you can find to change the habit. Try fitting your new habit into the daily routines you already have. Routines run on autopilot and resist big changes, but they’re easy to hack from within once you understand how they work. Habitual behavior begins with a trigger or cue and results in a psychological reward. For example: At 3:00, I take a coffee break in the office. The coffee tastes good and makes me feel alert. 3:00 is the cue The coffee break is the behavior, and Feeling alert is the reward . If you can insert a new behavior into this cycle, leaving the cue and the reward intact, your brain should adapt more easily, especially if you’ve kept the task small: At 3:00, I walk to the coffee bar on Broadway. The coffee tastes good and makes me more alert, I get a little exercise, and the fresh air clears my head. You don’t need any particular motivation to make the change because you’re already doing pretty much the same thing. And that makes it easy to gradually ramp up to your objective: At 3:00, I go for a brisk power-walk . It gives me some exercise, clears my head, reduces stress, and makes me more alert. The cue hasn’t changed. The rewards are similar but greater. But the behavior has completely changed. Of course, this doesn’t happen overnight. It may take a long time to get where you want to go. But as long as each step is headed in the right direction, you’ll get there. Step 3: Stay motivated with Evernote Wonder how you can to keep the cycle going? It’s pretty easy to slip into the old ways if you aren’t making sure you’re accountable to yourself . Here’s where Evernote can help. Create a Personal Development notebook in Evernote where you can keep it all together. Here’s some of what goes in your Personal Development notebook: Calendars Checklists and reminders An inspiration archive Calendar Calendars are simple yet powerful motivational tools. When you successfully achieve your daily goal, mark your calendar. That’s it. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld famously used this method when building his career, making sure he wrote new material every day. Seeing a string of marked days on a calendar is a great way to build confidence and a sense of accomplishment. It also provides gentle pressure: you’ll go out of your way to make sure you “don’t break the chain.” Checklists and reminders Need a little push? Build checklists and reminders into Evernote to remind you to keep working on your new habits. Good checklists might include your gym routines , that list of how many vegetables you’re supposed to eat every day, or tracking how many words you wrote each week. Tracking your progress in Evernote not only makes you accountable to yourself, but it’s fun to be able to notice yourself as you change your habits. Inspiration archive Found an article or image online that motivates you? Use Web Clipper to capture it in Evernote. Build a vision board that you can turn to when you feel the urge to slip. If you use IFTTT or Zapier to connect Evernote with other apps, there are recipes available for capturing favorite tweets or other social media updates, recording your progress, and automating many other tasks.", "date": "2017-12-29,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Get Unstuck and Love Teamwork Again", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/get-unstuck-love-teamwork-again/", "abstract": "Most of us probably agree that teamwork is essential to achieving big things. It’s pretty hard to go it alone. But in the same breath, we can also acknowledge another truth: sometimes, teamwork is just painful . We’ve all had that sinking feeling that our team is reinventing the wheel or spinning in circles. We’ve struggled while hunting for that file, trying to remember which tool someone used to send it to us. We’ve worked hard on a project, only to discover that it’s already been done—or even worse, that another team is currently working on the exact same thing. And we’ve watched as more meetings crop up, slowly taking over our calendars (and taking our sanity along with them). This all adds up to a lingering, deflating sense of frustration towards teamwork, complete with sarcastic jokes and eyerolls. It’s often tempting to look for quick fixes. Maybe you’ll knock a few meetings off the calendar or send out more status report emails. But that probably won’t get you very far. Because there’s something deeper going on here. These are all just symptoms of a broader problem. The real issue comes down to two things: communication and transparency . The antidote? Take small steps right now to start taking the dysfunction out of collaboration. Here are some quick tips on how to make it happen: 1. Improve communication Communication is at the core of collaborating, but we somehow both talk too much and share too little. We have too many ineffective meetings, yet we fail to share all the things we’re working on. We have all these communication tools, but we each use them differently, resulting in confusion and a mad scramble to track things down. Here are some quick tips you can try out to improve communication: Stand up for meetings that matter. It’s not about getting rid of all meetings, it’s about having the right ones. You need a healthy mix of bigger-picture strategy sessions and smaller, tactical-level planning parties. But you also need to share relevant updates and hear about work that’s currently being done so efforts aren’t duplicated. Consider introducing daily or weekly stand-ups or quick team-wide meetings to sync on what everyone’s up to. Set some ground rules. Things get easier when everyone chooses the right ways to communicate. Get together to decide on a ‘ team charter ’ for communication. Figure out when to use video conference, phone calls, chat, or email, setting a preference order. Get everyone up to speed. Use tools to help with the heavy lifting of making sure everyone has visibility into projects. For example, with Spaces in Evernote Business, you can use the ‘What’s New’ and ‘Pinned notes’ features to quickly get up to speed on new projects or important work that everyone needs to be aware of. You can make it even easier by creating a note with a running list of projects being worked on, pinning it in a space everyone has access to. Start a free trial of Evernote Business » 2. Build transparency It’s easy to get caught up in the heads-down grind of our own work, forgetting about others. We also have a tendency to only share polished products, focusing on the hits and not so much on the misses. But a culture of transparently sharing is critical. Here’s how to cultivate it: Share it all. Don’t just share the shiny, finished deliverable. Try sharing ‘works-in-progress,’ notes, research, status updates—the whole enchilada. With Spaces, you can have one place for all of your team’s work to live, so you don’t have to search across shared drives, emails, or your own files to resurface all the bits that went into previous work. Take the good with the bad. Actively share what’s going on, even when it’s not going particularly well. Use status updates or post-mortems to go over what could have been done better, so your mistakes aren’t repeated by someone else in the future. Remind people to share. Be that guy. Ask to see what someone’s working on. If your team uses Evernote Business, remind your coworker to add her notes to a space. Transparency only works when we all participate in it, and sometimes it’s helpful to give a little nudge. Share for the future. Transparency kills two birds with one stone, making your current and future selves more productive. When everything’s transparently communicated and documented, your present-day team will run more smoothly. But it will also help out future co-workers as well. With Evernote Business they’ll have the ability to hunt through your team’s Spaces Directory before starting a project, discovering and tapping into work that’s already been done . Collaboration is hard, but we’re on a mission to make it easier. And by taking small steps to improve communication and transparency, you can make teamwork a little better for everyone.", "date": "2018-04-11,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "The Triple Overload Problem—And What to Do About It", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/the-triple-overload-problem-and-what-to-do-about-it/", "abstract": "“Where did the time go?” “Will you look at the time!?” “Time flies when you’re having fun.” If you have the alarming feeling that time is actually speeding up, that somehow your days are getting shorter while the list of things you need to do is getting longer, then you’re not alone . But although time itself isn’t really speeding up, you’re not imagining things, either. We are, in fact, being bombarded with more data, more communication, and more interruption than ever before, creating ever more demands on our limited time and attention. That can leave us burned out and feeling as though there simply aren’t enough hours in the day for us to achieve everything we need—and want—to do. If it’s not one thing, it’s three You probably already know the feeling: There’s 150 emails you haven’t answered. Slack is blowing up. Client calls are always urgent (obviously). Lunch? Not a chance—and that third coffee certainly isn’t helping. You can’t find the files you need so you’re left chasing your tail, going around in circles. And at the end of the day, all you’ve really done is move some data from one place to another, hoping you’ve connected enough dots that something, somewhere actually happens. Dr. Beat Bühlmann has a name for this problem: Triple Overload. As the name suggests, Triple Overload is a multifaceted problem—three separate yet interconnected issues that plague almost every company. Each is a direct result of the explosion of information and technology that has come to define the modern world. They are: Data Overload—the exponential growth of knowledge By 1950, human knowledge was doubling every 25 years. Today, that’s been reduced to 14 months. In less than a decade, thanks largely to our interconnected devices, the sum total of all human knowledge will be doubling every day. This growth of knowledge is something to celebrate. After all, it’s driven incredible advances in our standard of living; it’s helped us find cures for previously fatal diseases, send rockets to the stars, and watch videos of cats on the internet. But there’s a flip side to that progress: a typical office may now have so much knowledge scattered across teams and folders, or buried inside emails, that it can be almost impossible to find what you need. Communication Overload—finding the space for deep work There you are, trying to get things done , when you see that little red circle pop up at the bottom of your computer screen, notifying you of a new email or chat message. It’s beckoning to you, practically shouting at you, and even if you don’t open it immediately, it’s already done its sneaky job by pulling your focus away from what you were doing. “It’s only 30 seconds,” you tell yourself as you switch windows. But since you spend 80 percent of your day ‘communicating,’ you might never get back to what you were doing. While once upon a time, in the days B.C. (Before Cellphone), we may have wished we could be more connected, today’s near-ubiquitous communication tools leave us longing for a time when it really was possible to disconnect and find a space free from distraction. Cognitive Overload—the need for GTD Five minutes between interruptions. That’s all you get these days. And let’s face it, between emails, chat messages, phone calls, meetings, and the constant “Hey, have you got a minute?”, most days you’re lucky to even get that. Here’s the unfortunate truth: it takes you an average of 23 minutes to fully refocus after an interruption. In other words, by answering that message, you’ve zapped your ability to focus for the next half hour. As a result, you finish the day exhausted and defeated, with a to-do list that’s still maddeningly long. Scared, yet? Don’t be. We recently put together a whitepaper, Triple Overload and What You Can Do About It , to help you tackle this challenge head-on. In this paper, Dr. Bühlmann, Evernote’s General Manager EMEA, and Think Productive’s Graham Allcott lay out a number of simple success strategies you can put into action today to help you overcome the dreaded Triple Overload, reclaim control of your time, and transform your life. While we definitely recommend you read the complete white paper , here are a few suggestions to get you started: 1. Protect your best attention Wouldn’t it be great if you could engage in deep work for the entire eight or more hours you’re at work? The fact is, the human brain isn’t wired that way. We all have a window of time when our attention is at its highest, and we can devote all our mental resources to the task at hand. Protect that time. Reducing or removing as many distractions as possible gives you the opportunity to get more done in two hours than you previously did in eight. 2. Embrace the word “No” It can be emotionally painful to say “No” to a new task. Perhaps you want to be a team player, perhaps you feel pressure to accept everything that is thrown at you, or perhaps your company’s culture is simply to work until you drop. Regardless, it’s in your—and your company’s—best interest to get comfortable with “No.” Your best work comes when you are rested and recharged, so politely declining requests for your time gives you the opportunity to perform at your highest level on the tasks that really matter. Remember that self-care is not selfish. And that “No” is a complete sentence. 3. Collect info in big buckets, not tiny cups If you’re trying to throw a piece of paper into a wastepaper basket from across the room, would you rather be aiming for one big target or a dozen tiny ones? When you’re saving documents, email attachments, and other files, it can be tempting to create a large number of small folders, each with a narrow purpose. After all, you’d think it would be easier to find something if it lives in a folder with a very specific name and few other items. Actually, the opposite is true. A smaller number of ‘big buckets,’ each containing a large number of files, is quicker to search, easier to maintain, and more convenient to file new items into.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Tax Season: Next Year, No Fear", "author": ["Neal Cavanaugh"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/tax-season-next-year-no-fear/", "abstract": "If you live in the United States, hopefully some congratulations are in order. You’ve  filed your taxes and put another stressful season behind you. Maybe you took care of it months ago or perhaps you filed just under the wire. But whether you worked with a professional or took a DIY approach, you probably had a few late nights surrounded by piles of paper and tiny little receipts. It’s like a journal of the previous year as seen through the eyes of a messy paper trail. What is a 1099-G exactly? Was that flight a business trip? Who is Jordan M? And why did I take her to dinner and spend $126.89? What’s more is that every situation is different. Maybe you got married or moved across state lines last year. Perhaps you have a 9-5 with a gig on the side. Or maybe you’re self-employed. Regardless of your circumstances, preparing your tax return is usually a tedious, soul-numbing experience that’s also, for many of us,  full of anxiety. But it doesn’t have to be that way. You can take the pain out of tax season by staying organized all year long. With proper planning (and a trusty Evernote account of course), April 15, 2019 won’t exactly be a holiday, but it will be a lot easier. Tracking everything down is easy when it’s all in one place One of the biggest hurdles when it comes to preparing your taxes? Just knowing where everything is. You have to organize all your government forms, fish out your returns from previous years, and hunt down every little piece of paper that could even remotely be related to your finances. Soon enough, you start to feel like a forensic accountant—minus the extensive training. But if over the course of this year you build the habit of keeping everything in one place, you’ll set yourself up for success and prevent a lot of headaches. Here are five tips for managing it all in Evernote: 1. Set up your system It helps if you have a little structure. The good news is that this is something you can take care of right now. There are lots of different ways you could organize this, depending on your preferences. But here’s one idea: create a finance stack. Stacks are way to group notebooks around a similar theme. That way you can see the big picture all in one place but also easily drill down into the details of a specific issue. For example, you could keep your tax information in context along with your ‘Budget’ and ‘Mortgage info’ notebooks. As for setting up your notebooks , you could create a general ‘Taxes’ notebook, or a specific one for each year (‘2018 Taxes’). You may also want to consider setting up a ‘Receipts’ notebook to send all those little scraps and files into one central place, moving them into the appropriate tax year notebook at a later date. 2. Add in the important stuff When you’ve got your system in place, it’s time to add what you already have. You can attach files to a note so you can easily put tax-specific documents, like PDFs of returns from previous years, in your taxes notebook. Create a note for each thing you want to add, using the tax year and the name of what you’re adding as your note title (such as ‘2017 – Invoices’). Think about other files you could add, such as loan documents, health insurance details, or your banking and savings account information. 3. Tame your receipts, once and for all By creating a structure and adding the files you already have, you’ve done what you can to put yourself on a good footing for tax season next year. Now it’s about changing your organization habits and maintaining the behaviors that will put you across the finish line. One easy area to focus on? These pesky little slips of paper (or assorted digital files). Whether it’s a business cost, a moving expense, or a charitable donation, receipts are something you need to keep track of for the tax man. Thankfully, they are something that can be managed on-the-go, all year round. Use the in-app camera in Evernote for Android or iOS to capture any receipt right when you get it while you’re out and about. The best part? Not only do you not have to worry about losing it, you can also search through the text, as Evernote makes text inside images searchable . So if you know that you had some business expenses on that trip to California back in March, you could simply search for “gas Santa Monica March” and quickly pull it up. 4. Get it out of your inbox and off the web Another issue with preparing your taxes these days is that you don’t just have physical documents and receipts to keep track of. Your financial information and receipts are scattered to the digital winds, hidden throughout various accounts, web pages, and emails, which makes it hard to hunt it all down. Thankfully, by saving email into Evernote and using Web Clipper , you can send it all straight to your taxes notebook as you encounter them, so it’s all in one place this time next year. When you get an email that has something to do with your taxes, such as an electronic receipt, bill, or statement, just use your Evernote email address to forward it to your account. Likewise, when you come across a contract, invoice, or payment confirmation when on a web browser, use Web Clipper to save it to your notebook. 5. Share the burden Chances are other people need to be involved in managing your financial situation. Whether it’s your accountant, your significant other, or your sister the business whiz, you can easily share your tax notebook so you can work together to get it done. When it comes to taxes, getting all your ducks in a row isn’t easy. But with the right structure in place, and about 10 minutes of scanning, filing, and saving each week, you’ll be ready when tax season inevitably rolls around again.", "date": "2018-04-17,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "5 Ways to Green Up Your Life", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/5-ways-green-life/", "abstract": "“Solid waste generation rates are rising fast, on pace to exceed 11 million tons per day by 2100.” — The World Bank That’s like throwing away 22 million grand pianos every single day. Let that sink in. You know that you want to help make a positive environmental impact on the planet. Maybe you’re already mindful of recycling and producing less trash. You’ve cut down on eating out, started composting, and even begun to carpool. How can you make your life even greener? As fierce supporters of adopting a paperless life , we’re here to help you reduce your carbon footprint even further. Here are five areas you can start tackling. 1. Start with the basics With a flood of “eco” branded products out there (some of which are misleading), recycling rules that are different in every city, and the guilt you may feel about “doing it wrong,” getting started can be overwhelming. But that’s okay. You don’t have to try to change everything overnight. You’ve got to build habits little by little. Reducing your single-use plastic is the easiest way to get started. Here are some common things you can replace: Cups and bottles — pick up a stainless steel water bottle, and start using a portable tumbler for your morning coffee. Drinking straws — You can find these in stainless steel too. Sip, sip, hooray! Grocery bags — Cloth bags are reusable, can usually hold more, and won’t rip when you’re halfway home. Pro Tip: Track how well you’re sticking to your new green habits with Evernote’s monthly planner templates . Start small by making your first month all about reducing plastic water bottle waste and have the next month’s focus be switching to reusable hot beverage containers. 2. Go paperless Documents, receipts, junk mail, bills. We’re surrounded by it, but paper doesn’t have to be a burden. Here are a few ways you can help save our forests: Opt-out of junk mail lists once and for all. Check out this how-to from Eco-Cycle . Say no to paper receipts when shopping and ask for them to be emailed to you instead. Sign-up for e-statements and pay your bills online. Start asking if you can sign documents electronically . How-to Geek recommends how. Pro Tip: Shameless plug! Use an app to take notes and to manage your paper. ? Here are 38 things you can save digitally in Evernote . 3. Rethink how and what you eat Do you ever buy groceries, only to have a third of it go bad by the end of the week? You’re not alone. In fact, according to a recent study , as much as 40 percent of food goes uneaten in the U.S. And wasting food is just the tip of the iceberg—much of the food we eat also travels for at least 1,500 miles from a farm to our table, causing large quantities of pollution. It may be hard to believe, but some research shows that raising beef is so resource intensive that eating it regularly is actually worse for the planet than driving a car. With careful planning, we can reduce food waste and eat more consciously. Plan your meals ahead of time to minimize throwing away groceries that have gone bad. Shop at a local farmers market or stick to the local produce section of grocery stores. Add more plant-based meals to your diet. Eat ugly produce. You read that right. Tons of perfectly good produce goes to waste just because it doesn’t look “perfect.” Pro Tip: Use Evernote’s checklist feature to make a shopping list (and stick to it) so you don’t buy more food than you need. 4. Think before you shop According to The True Cost , the world consumes 80 billion new pieces of clothing every year,  thanks to the fast fashion industry . That’s a whopping 400 percent more than we consumed just two decades ago. When it comes to making a change, here’s a fun mantra to keep in mind: refuse, reuse, repair . In other words: Buy fewer fashion items —do you really need that new blouse? Participate in the circular economy and use second-hand items when possible. Take damaged clothes to the tailor for repair instead of throwing them away. When you do buy new clothes and accessories, look for quality, durability, and sustainable materials. Pro Tip: Evernote can help you be more thoughtful about your fashion choices. Some people find that simply adding items to a list can cut down on impulse buying. 5. Simplify your skincare Titanium dioxide. Paraben. Triclosan. Microbeads. Yeah, we don’t know what any of that means either. But these ingredients and more are lurking in many of your beauty products and are known to make their way into the ocean and harm marine wildlife. If you want to take your sustainability journey to the next level, then it’s time to take a harder look at all the lotions and potions you use. Guys, we’re talking to you too! Here are some steps you can take to simplify your body care routine and avoid plastic waste: Skip the body wash and go with a moisturizing fragrance-free bar soap. Go vintage with a reusable safety razor, and recycle the steel blades. Switch to organic cotton swabs that have a wood applicator. Try using shampoo and conditioner in solid bars instead of from a plastic pump bottle. Pro Tip: Keep a note with a list of environmentally conscious brands in Evernote so you can quickly share it with others. At the end of the day, no one is perfect and we can’t beat ourselves up about not living fully sustainable lives. But remember, we only have one living planet and it’s up to each of us to protect it. Every step in a greener direction makes a world of a difference.", "date": "2018-04-20,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Growing a Business? How to Find the Right Tools and Talent", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/growing-business-find-right-tools-talent/", "abstract": "Every idea, no matter how grand, starts in the head of a single person. And most businesses, no matter how large, started out the same way. For small teams with big ambitions, the first step toward growth is establishing a stable, rich foundation of tools and talent. But time and resources are limited. And you can’t just think about immediate needs, either; the foundation you lay down must be fertile enough to foster growth and elastic enough to keep pace. It’s enough to make anyone’s head spin. In recognition of Small Business Week (April 29–May 5, 2018), the Evernote team linked up with Upwork, the global freelancing platform, to think through some of these issues. The result is a short ebook called Go for Growth: How to Scale Up Faster , a guide to trends, tools, and talent that growing businesses can take advantage of right now. For the latest episode of our podcast, Taking Note , the authors of the ebook sat down to talk through what they’ve observed and shared some of their favorite tips. Taking Note: S2 E3 — Growing a Small Business Takes Tools and Talent http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-S2E3-Small-Business-Upwork.mp3 Length: 31 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS What are some of the common challenges and the pain points that you’re seeing right now across the small business landscape? Rich Pearson, Upwork: I’ve talked to a lot of our small business customers. The most frequent challenge they cite is figuring out how to grow cost-effectively while remaining lean. These aren’t companies that have a ton of budget or a whole lot of employees, so as a small business, you’re always seeking to grow in a smart way. This is one of the reasons why small businesses are embracing flexible work arrangements because it’s such a win-win. Businesses get access to talent without having to compete directly with some of the larger established companies that may have more money in perks, and then talent gets to work when they want, where they want. With the improvements in communication and collaboration, technology with tools like Slack and Evernote, small business are no longer limited to the talent pool that’s 30 miles from their headquarters. In this way, really, the internet is becoming the road to work. Michele Don Durbin, Evernote: We also love talking with our small business customers. Having tools like Upwork that bring together people who are experts in their area exactly when you need it and for what you need, combined with the democratization of IT, new innovative tools, affordable apps that don’t take a 12-month implementation, and ubiquitous connectivity means that small businesses actually can compete with larger, established enterprises. Because they tend to be smaller, they also tend to be a lot more nimble, and they can react to trends in the market, they can react to changes in their own base, and they can put out new innovations at a faster pace. What actually ends up happening when we think about challenges for these small businesses are actually very similar challenges to some of the big enterprises. Our GM of EMEA for Evernote, Dr. Beat Bühlmann, just wrote a paper called The Challenge of Triple Overload . Interestingly enough, because we’re so connected, because we have so many pools of talent and information to pull on, every kind of knowledge worker, every kind of business, small and large, is actually dealing with what we are calling a triple overload. We’re seeing people overloaded by data, spending up to two and a half hours a day searching for information. We’re seeing them overloaded by different types of communications. I think one Harvard Business Review study recently noted that knowledge workers spend about 80% of their time communicating or collaborating through email, messages, chat, and so you can’t really get to that deep work. Then all of that results in a cognitive overload. And that just ends in burnout for everyone. Being able to have the right tools and pick the right resources are going to put you at a much better advantage. We often hear about how technology is accelerating at this exponential pace. What I hear you saying is that information is also growing at an exponential rate, and I assume that would mean that challenges for business leaders are growing at an exponential rate. Rich, would you say that reflects your experience? RP: Absolutely. I agree completely with what Michele said. As more information comes in, for all of us and particularly small business, our to-do lists get longer and longer. And that’s where as you look at maybe the bottom third of your to-do list, you can go find an expert who’s able to either pilot something or validate a thesis. That’s where I see the advantage that small businesses have. Whereas in a larger company, that might become a task force where they’re going to study it for two months. Then you have to wait for head count in order to really take advantage of the recommendation, at which point, the momentum is lost and you never get to do it. What are some of the other qualities or practices that in your view can help a small business succeed and grow? RP: I think it’s not unlike any business. The key pain is really how do you get an edge? I think we have a lot of tools to level the playing field, but what’s going to help you differentiate yourself and stand out in your customers’ minds? So for example, my dentist has a pug in her office that sits on my lap when they drill on my teeth. That might be a little silly, but you get the idea. That’s one of the reasons why I go back. And her customer service allows me to contact her at any time, schedule an appointment. Those are the things that small businesses, being closer to their customers, are able to focus on and really effectively combat larger businesses. MDD: I need Rich’s dentist, because that sounds like the perfect way to be at the dentist. He’s totally right. At a larger corporation, there are these defined rules and responsibilities. At a small business, everybody wears a lot of hats. One of the things that I’ve seen work and I’ve put into practice, even within my team in a larger business sort of acting like a small business, is stepping outside of your own company and your own industry and asking questions. We get caught in the day-to-day of growing our business. We get caught in the day-to-day management of people and challenges and things that come up and we don’t really set aside time to say, hey, what are the trends, what new research exists, what assumptions have I made that may or may not be true anymore? There’s this example that I heard, I was just speaking with some folks internally and somebody came up with a stat: do you know that 40% of revenue from baby products actually comes from households that don’t have babies? It makes sense if you think about it. When a family has a baby or has kids, other people, aunts, uncles, grandparents, godparents, friends, they always show up. Nobody wants to show up empty handed, and so these households without children are actually buying a lot of baby gifts. If you look a little bit deeper, it turns out that those households driving 40% of revenue are actually accounting for 60% of the profits. The reason is, if you have a baby, you tend to be a little bit more price sensitive. But without the baby, they might be willing to pay that extra $2 to get the Spider-Man version of the toothbrush rather than something else, because the gift is what matters. The interesting thing is, in the past, I think you’d have [internal] research teams and dedicated groups. This research literally took two and a half minutes to find on Google. This talk about data calls to mind something else. Small businesses nowadays have to think about tech in new ways, too. It’s almost like every company is a tech company to some extent. How should small businesses approach that change? MDD: As I mentioned in the beginning, it’s the democratization of IT, right? The cloud, apps, connectivity, this has all brought really interesting tools and services into the hands of everyday people. The way that we like to think about it is the bring your own device, bring your own app kind of movement that’s happening. Because at the baseline for any company, productivity is personal. There’s never going to be one ubiquitous tool. You can’t buy one laptop or one mobile phone and think that it’s going to suit the diverse workforces that we have today. If you can let your employees use their own devices and use their own tools for work, you’re going to see engagement go up, you’re going to see satisfaction to go up, you’re going to see productivity go up, all of these things that are going to help you continue to grow. Where a small business would really just need to be aware is: let’s leverage the good that’s coming from technology and making us a technology company, but let’s also make sure that we’re doing what’s right for our business. For example, if you let this go unmetered, you might end up with a shadow IT force, right? Like there’s just things that are happening and you don’t really know what’s going on. Just take steps to make sure that security and privacy are maintained, and that there’s an official policy that’s simple and helps your workers work with what they want without putting anybody or any data at risk. What about people? Not only is there this profusion of tools available, but there are also more and more specializations, more and more skills. How do you figure out what the right mix is of skills that you need to bring on, and how do you balance bringing on permanent versus freelance people? RP: That’s a great question and something that we live every day at Upwork. Within marketing, for example, on the design side, we have three full-time designers and 12 distributed designers. That enables our team to have access to a motion graphics expert, a video production expert, someone who is an amazing graphic designer, and really build a team that I am using for their specialized skills. At the same time, you need a core strength and a choreographer in order to manage that talent. The small businesses that I know, the owners and their teams are really master choreographers. They have to wear so many hats. Their ability to understand what needs to be “core” or inside the company and what they can tap into is changing. If it’s privacy related or something that’s your IP, you probably want to continue to have that in-house. But if it’s something that’s tactical or a pilot program, there’s another way of doing it. The other trend that we’re seeing from small businesses is hiring is harder than it’s ever been. We do a survey every year on this and small businesses specifically said it’s three times harder this year than it was last year. As a result, 45% of small businesses are using flexible talent or freelancers today and 65% expect to use it going forward. As it gets harder to bring on full-time talent, small business have a decision to make especially with technology changing so fast. There’s bit of a chicken and egg situation here. Because you have a group of people that are already in your company and you need to find tools that can fit them in the way they work, but then you also need to find people that can fit the tools that you bring in. How do you put a strategy around all of this? Where do you start? MDD: When you’re first looking for tools, it’s actually pretty straightforward. There’s some basics that you can follow. First, ask some good questions. What are the biggest pain points, what are the processes and things inefficient, what needs to be automated? People doing the work are the ones best positioned to judge how a new tool or system is going to impact their daily routines. If those people involved are distributed workforce that’s coming in, then we need to talk to them. Then think about scalability. You have a certain place in your business plan where you sit right now, where do you want to be? When you narrow down your list to your top solutions and where you think you’re headed, the real questions are things like, does the company who makes this tool have a track record for innovation that applies to where your business is headed? How flexible, how scalable is it? Does it integrate with tools that your workforce is already using and already loves? That’s the only way it’s really going to work for you. Then, obviously, a business case is going to be really important. Put it down in dollars and cents, what are your long-term and short-term goals. Because after you implement it, you want to actually be able to go back at some point in time and say, we thought we were going to get a million dollars’ worth of savings, did we do it, didn’t we do it, where did we miss on our assumption, is this is actually not the right tool for us, is there something else wrong? RP: I think a great practice is to look at your current behaviors, what you’re doing on a regular basis and where you’re adding the most value and where maybe you’re spending more time than the value that you’re delivering, and then think about how tools can help you do that. Personally, I’ve always been kind of a maniac about to-do lists and found that was something that I was spending a lot of time personally doing. Until I found Evernote, where I was able to get a lot more organized on how I manage my ideas. And then as you start scaling that across an organization and a team, it gets really powerful as teams are building on each other’s ideas in real time. This makes me think about workflows, because this is where tools and talent all have to come together. How can a team that is already trying to go at warp speed pause and create some of these workflows? RP: I think the most important thing is to start. And specifically to start with smaller projects that can show success, at which point you can then scale as you see that success. Another key component is making sure that the person leading your project or who’s starting is very comfortable with online collaboration tools and new technology. Having somebody who is fluent at leading that can be a great way to achieve success. Then, over-communication. Now this is more about hiring distributed teams. Maybe you didn’t have a workflow that made sure you had to check-in every day. That’s something that we’ve seen, is making conscious, intentional check-ins with your distributed team and including them in the meetings that you have. Then as you see success, before you scale, make sure that you’re assessing what worked and what didn’t. In most cases where we see small businesses going from one customer service agent to 10 and really scaling entire teams, that’s where the magic happens. MDD: Yeah. I totally agree with Rich. Communication is a cornerstone for that. I run a global team, so, again, those differences in languages, the differences in cultures, those nonverbal cues, they’re all going to be different. How and when to communicate, there are all sorts of unspoken expectations around priority, urgency, response time. It’s so important to just lay that foundation and have that standardization from the beginning, and we actually apply that as well to workflows. Using something like Evernote which lets you create sort of a shared organizational structure for the way that you manage projects, for the way that the workflows happen, for the way that documentation and decisions are all recorded in a sort of a centralized, but totally accessible area, it basically helps you measure results and maintain efficiencies and quality as well as accountability, so that when your team is growing and processes get more complex, the workflows actually remain, in some cases, ridiculously nimble.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "3 Android Superpowers You Need to Try Today", "author": ["Anthony Bartlett"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/3-android-superpowers-need-try-today/", "abstract": "There are now over 3.3 billion smartphones in the world, and 2.7 billion of those are Android devices. Or, to put it another way, over one-third of the world’s population now relies on an Android phone to stay connected, get organized, and feel more in control. So it’s crucial that the experience of using Evernote on Android should be seamless and intuitive. If you’re looking to capture ideas ‘faster than a speeding bullet’ and help your productivity take flight, here are three marvelous tips for using Evernote on your Android device. Some are new features we’re excited to introduce, while others are long-time favorites. May they boost your note taking and simplify your life. Go go widget power! One of Android’s undisputed superpowers is its flexibility. You can customize your device’s interface to suit your needs, and even use widgets to access apps without having to open them. Evernote for Android offers three customizable widget types that make it quicker and easier for you to capture your ideas, add pictures, and search your notes: Actions widget (1×1) —Need quick access to a note, the camera, or search? Pull your favorite feature out of the app into a single, dedicated icon to start doing whatever you need to do. Action bar (4×1) —Select from 11 different actions to create your own “Best of Evernote” highlight reel. List widget (4×2) —Add shortcuts to key actions of your choosing along with a customized view of your notes. The source of these notes is up to you—designate a specific notebook, use your recent notes, or fill it with reminders to help you stay on top of your to-do list. Check out this article for step-by-step instructions on installing the Android widget on your phone. Choose your favorite or try a combination of all three to create your very own Evernote command center. Pro Tip: If Evernote is installed on external storage, you’ll only be able to add the action widget. To add the action bar and list widgets, make sure you have Evernote installed on your device’s internal storage. Collect photos in a single bound Post-it® notes, receipts, whiteboard images—they’ve all been sitting there in your photo gallery, sandwiched between your selfies, family photos, and vacation snaps. But if you wanted to save them to Evernote, add context to them, or share them with anyone, you had to copy them over one-by-one. We’ve made it much easier. Evernote now scans your gallery for any photos containing text. If it detects an image that fits the bill, the app will ask you if you want to save it into Evernote. You can preview the picture and then decide yes or no. When you save text-based images to Evernote—for example, business cards or meeting notes—you’ll see them in your sidebar under the heading “Collect photos”. From there, you can move them into a note, adding additional information or attachments if you want. Pro Tip : You can turn this feature off at any time. But we think you’ll love it. Use x-ray vision on your notes One of Evernote’s most powerful time-management tricks—and one of the most popular—is tagging . When you create a new note in Evernote, you can add a helpful word or phrase to the note that lets you find it easily later. Tags also help you organize the overload of information coming at you daily by helping you group similar items together. One Android user who is a firm believer in tagging is Robert Řeřicha, a Czech scientist, musician, and developer. “My advice is simple,” he says. “Tag everything you collect in Evernote.” In fact, Robert’s experience using Evernote in his scientific career led him to develop his own Android app, TagClipper , that makes tagging in Evernote easier. He says, “Often, I read several e-books or other digital content sources at once and I make notes from each one of those. Since I want to save all excerpts with appropriate context, I use Evernote.” TagClipper extends Evernote by allowing users to automatically add multiple tags to their content as they clip it. Robert adds, “TagClipper makes Evernote better by upgrading every piece of saved content to a fully annotated research note, with associated tags and a standard format citation.” Robert’s final piece of tagging advice is, “Don’t use just one tag, use multiple tags. You never know what the future will bring, and what the context of your notes will be several years from now.” By combining the power of Evernote with the flexibility of the Android platform, developers like Robert Řeřicha are creating applications that empower you capture your ideas faster and leverage them in new and exciting ways.

Anybody who can get online can get on a soapbox. And no one has the time to curate everything that’s being said about living well, productivity, morality, or any aspect of living a better life. There’s simply too much to grasp. But we’ve done some homework and discovered that every year there’s a specific event, one moment, that is perfectly centered and unapologetically committed to offering great life advice: the graduation speech. It’s one sure way to find the kind of thinking that is useful, smart, transformative, and sometimes even transcendent. An unlikely collection of great ideas Every year, an eclectic bunch of interesting people share words of wisdom with soon to be graduated men and women. Todd Rundgren. President Obama. Jeff Bezos. Bono. Stephen Colbert. Toni Morrison. Steve Jobs. Ellen DeGeneres. They’ve all been at the podium on graduation day, full of promises, the practical, and the comedic. Here are some highlights from the last 15 years. Love what you do or stop doing it The price of hating your life is too high. It can’t be said often enough. Love what you do and you’ll never work a day in your life. Everybody has some kind of passion. And if you can find it, work at it. Literally. Wrap a wonderful work life around something you love. If you can’t do that, the backup plan is to figure out a way to love what you are doing. Just don’t fight it. The daily struggle will make you sick, depressed, and tired. Or all three. “I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.” — Steve Jobs : Stanford, 2005 “I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged.” — J. K. Rowling : Harvard University, 2008 “I implore you to not fear what you are drawn to, for rejecting that is to stymie the very patterns that make you, well, you. Imagine the torture of putting yourself through that. No matter how much money you make, you will not be happy spending your time imagining the path you wished you’d chosen.” — Max Londberg : University of Oregon, 2013 Success and failure Decide for yourself what these ideas mean to you. No matter who you are or where you come from, right now, at this moment you probably have a clear image of what success and failure look like. Great. It’s inevitable. Goals are good. The trick is to let these ideas change and evolve because that’s inevitable too. Take what you wanted as a kid, or what your parents wanted or a teacher, throw it all in a blender and make it your own. If you don’t come up with your own recipe, you’re eating somebody else’s dinner and it’s already cold. “If everybody followed their first dreams in life, the world would be ruled by cowboys and princesses.” — Stephen Colbert : Northwestern University, 2011 “David Letterman wanted to be Johnny Carson, and was not, and as a result, my generation of comedians wanted to be David Letterman. And none of us are. My peers and I have all missed that mark in a thousand different ways. But the point is this: It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique. It’s not easy, but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right, your perceived failure can become a catalyst for profound reinvention.” — Conan O’Brien : Dartmouth College, 2011 “If you don’t fail, you’re not even trying. My wife told me this great expression, ‘To get something you never had, you have to do something you never did.’” — Denzel Washington : University of Pennsylvania, 2011 Open Up Explore. Question habits. Listen up. Change. If you’re restless and unsettled, that’s what you’ll think about. If you’re in a good, well-balanced place you might just settle into the comfort zone. But in either case, it’s a good idea to avoid getting isolated or controlled by your own present situation, good or bad. Curiosity. Openness. Interaction. Change. Listening. Focus. Dedication. These are habits too, and they tend to lead to growth over stagnation. They’re simply life alternatives. Decisions you can make in your own self-interest. “Because as my grandmother used to tell me, every time a fool speaks, they are just advertising their own ignorance. Let them talk. If you don’t, you just make them a victim, and then they can avoid accountability.” — President Barack Obama : Howard University, 2016 “As you start your journey, the first thing you should do is throw away that store-bought map and begin to draw your own.” — Michael Dell : University of Texas at Austin, 2003 Explore The good stuff is worth looking for First impressions can be risky. They are borne out of the prejudice that what you already know and like is all there is. It can serve to shut you down. Bust out of your comfort zone. Take a chance. Get over yourself. Explore. No matter how long you live, with your eyes wide open, there will be worlds of wonder waiting to be discovered. So keep looking. “One of the greatest gifts you can give yourself, right here, right now, in this single, solitary, monumental moment in your life, is to decide, without apology, to commit to the journey, and not to the outcome.” — Joyce DiDonato : Juilliard School, 2014 “Just because something doesn’t confirm your existing beliefs does not mean it’s a hoax. The smartest and most successful people I know are the people who are constantly evolving, always learning. And some of them, believe it or not, are smart enough to occasionally change their minds.” — Stephanie Ruhle : Lehigh University, 2017 “If you love only yourself, you will serve only yourself. And you will have only yourself. So no more winning. Instead, try to love others and serve others, and hopefully find those who love and serve you in return.” — Stephen Colbert : Northwestern University, 2011 “So how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire? And the honest answer is this: You won’t.” — Jon Stewart : College of William and Mary 2004 Forget about it Sometimes a short memory is your very best friend. When a professional baseball pitcher, making $500,000 a game, throws a fastball that turns into a grand slam to left field, the most important thing his training tells him is: forget about it. Throw the next pitch. You know how to do this. See what happens. OK, it’s a sports analogy. But it really works. The best way to deal with mistakes and failures is to give yourself a day, an hour, a minute to think about it and move on. “Fall forward. Reggie Jackson struck out 2,600 times in his career, the most in the history of baseball. But you don’t hear about the strikeouts. People remember the home runs. Fall forward. Thomas Edison conducted 1,000 failed experiments. Did you know that? I didn’t know that because the 1,001st was the light bulb. Fall forward. Every failed experiment is one step closer to success.” — Denzel Washington : University of Pennsylvania, 2011 “I wish someone had said to me that it’s normal to feel lost for a little while.” — Ira Glass : Goucher College, 2012 “Rehearsal’s over. You’re going out there now, you’re going to do this thing. How you live matters. You’re going to fall down, but the world doesn’t care how many times you fall down, as long as it’s one fewer than the number of times you get back up.” — Aaron Sorkin : Syracuse University 2012 The classic advice column of all time 400 years old and still perfect Not precisely a commencement address, this is the advice Polonius had for his son, Laertes, on his departure to university in Paris. Try and get over the 16th-century poetic language. It’s not that hard. The bottom line: If this had been written today, it would be on the back of every diploma handed out every year. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act. Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel, But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch’d, unfledged comrade. Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear ’t that th’ opposèd may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear but few thy voice. Take each man’s censure but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not expressed in fancy—rich, not gaudy, …Neither a borrower nor a lender be, For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. — William Shakespeare: Hamlet (Act I, Scene iii)", "date": "2018-05-18,"},

But it’s also a good time to take stock of our goals, our habits, and even our careers. Because that’s what “spring cleaning” is really all about: regaining control of our environment and our lives . This is important. Too often we let life become something that happens to us, rather than something that comes from within. We forget that we can be in control of ourselves. And we forget that the people around us can help, if only we take the time to build strong relationships. So how do we break out of our ruts and regain clarity? How do we reclaim those dusty, forgotten goals we might have set back in January, or even decades ago? And how do we build the trust and influence that will get others on board, so those goals can become a reality? For the latest episode of Taking Note , the Evernote podcast, we spoke with two experts who can guide us there. Taking Note: S2 E2 — Michael Hyatt & Marvell Allen Length: 49 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS Michael Hyatt: “Life is integrated. You can’t compartmentalize.” In his new book, Your Best Year Ever: A 5-Step Plan for Achieving Your Most Important Goals , leadership mentor Michael Hyatt outlines a system for reconnecting with our goals, finding purpose, and building sustainable habits that can have a real impact on improving our lives. Here are some highlights from our conversation: Your book came came out right at the start of January, timed with New Year’s resolutions. By now, most New Years’ resolutions have long since failed and been abandoned. It seems like every year, we get excited in December, maybe early January, we say we’re gonna do this thing this year and then we just fall right off the horse. How do we break that cycle so that we’re not waiting until next December to start again? Well, first of all, I think we need to realize that there’s still a lot of time left in the year, and the year doesn’t have to be the calendar year, it could just be the next 12 months. It’s kind of an arbitrary way to measure time anyway. I just got asked this question the other day on social media, somebody said, “Well, is it too late to have my best year ever?” And I said, “Absolutely not,” because nobody ever drifted to a destination they would have chosen. The only alternative to planning and intending for this to be your best year ever is to just drift through the next months, hoping that you have a better outcome. That’s not likely to happen without some planning and some intention. I think there’s a couple of basic mistakes people make, in the difference between a resolution and a goal. First of all, a goal is written. A resolution, it might be something you think of, it may be something you say to your best friend or your spouse, but it’s not often written, yet all the research shows that the mere act of writing a goal down not only produces clarity, but on average increases the likelihood of you achieving that goal by 42%. Another thing though, that people often do, is they lose visibility on their goals, even if they write it down. How many times have you written down a goal list, or even in corporations where you do a strategic plan, you go to a lot of effort to create it, and then put it on the shelf, or tuck it away in a drawer, or let it collect digital dust on your hard drive. You’ve got to have a systematic way to keep those goals top of mind. To review them, to maintain their visibility, if you’re going to hope to accomplish them. If I’ve had something that I considered as a resolution that just didn’t work out, and now I want to try again, that can be very disillusioning. Is just going back to square one and writing it down a good way to get over the failure? I think there’s a process. In fact, in the entire second section of the book, Your Best Year Ever , I talk about processing the past. What you don’t want to do is drag the worst of the past into the best of the future. I borrowed a term from the US military, called ‘the after action review,’ where you go in and you look what worked, what didn’t work, and what can I learn, and do differently in the future. That’s part of the process. But obviously that is not enough unto itself, and neither is just raw willpower, because probably that’s what we tried in January, and look how far it got us. If raw willpower can’t get it done, what can? Well, I think first of all we’ve got to make sure that these are deeply related to something that we want. So many times we do things that we think we should do. Somebody else in our life says this is an important goal, I think you ought to pursue this , but what is it that we really want? Do you feel that we should be taking the same approach at work and in our personal lives to achieving goals? Totally. I think we’ve got to live an integrated life. That’s what I think fundamentally it means to live with integrity, is that our life is integrated. You can’t compartmentalize because all these things impact the other areas of our life. For example, if we have a health crisis, that’s going to have an impact on our most important relationships. It’s going to have an impact at work. On the other hand, if we’re experiencing stress at work, it can have an impact on our health, or have an impact on our most important relationships. I don’t think it’s so much about balance, but it’s about integrating these as a seamless whole. The goal-setting methodology that I use with my clients and with my customers for their business is the same exact thing that I advocate for their personal life. Regardless, I tell people you don’t need more than about 7-10 goals a year. More than that and you’re going to lose focus, and you really jeopardize your chance of hitting any of them. In the book, you make a point that real life extends into multiple different domains. I think you listed 10 of them.There are so many different elements, and there are so many different demands on our time now, and so many distractions, but there are no more hours in a day. How do we attend to our whole lives in that environment? Well, I think it begins by taking an honest assessment of where we are. We have an assessment tool where you can get a score that shows you exactly where you are at in the 10 domains of life. What I encourage people to do is to take the areas where you didn’t score quite the way you wanted, and to come up with a plan, a goal, for how you could make that better over the course of this next year. You know, I think sometimes we look at goals like we got to win the lottery. We forget the power of incremental change over time. If you’re overweight, you probably didn’t get that way overnight, and you’re probably not going to lose that weight overnight. There’s a power in incremental change over time. That gets right into something else I wanted to ask you about because there are so many different kinds of goals. There are things you might be able to achieve in a month, or things that might take a decade or more, and then there’s just establishing a new habit. Where should we focus our energy? Well, I think it’s both. I think you need kind of the 35,000 foot view so you can see the long range. I call that the ‘life planning process,’ and I’ve written a book on that called Living Forward . Then I think we need the annual planning process, and to be honest, I don’t do much between those two. I see where I want to go in the next 10–25 years, and then I’m looking at where I want to go this next year, and that’s your best year ever. I break that down by a quarter, so 7–10 goals for the entire year, but no more than about two to three for any given quarter. Why? Because you’ve got a busy life. You’ve got other things you’re trying to do, and the things that are related to your goals are new things, things that are outside the scope of business as usual. You have to be very careful and very deliberate about those. Then I break it down further into the three actions that I could take this week that would move me in the direction of accomplishing those quarterly goals, and even further, what are my daily big three? What are the three tasks that, if I could complete today, would move me in the direction of my weekly big three, which would move me in the direction of my quarterly big three, which would move me in the direction of my annual goals, and the fulfillment of my life plan? “What are the three tasks that, if I could complete today, would move me in the direction of my weekly big three, which would move me in the direction of my quarterly big three, which would move me in the direction of my annual goals, and the fulfillment of my life plan?” It’s so easy to get wrapped up in details that you can really lose sight of the “why.” So often the answer to why, is: “well, because I have to.” Is there a good exercise, or a simple way to help yourself break out of that mode of thinking and get to the why? I get people for each goal, as they write down their goals for the next 12 months, to actually identify at least three whys. Why is it important that I achieve this goal? Or why is it important that I establish this habit? Then to rank those. What’s the one that’s the most compelling to you right now? So, years ago I wrote a book called Platform: Get Noticed in a Noisy World , and as I was writing that book I was nearing the deadline when I had to turn it in to the publisher, but I’d gone through a very busy season of speaking. I had a first draft that I wasn’t particularly happy with, and I really wanted to quit. I thought, you know, it’s too late to rally. I’m not sure I can meet the deadline, maybe I should just go ahead and quit. Except that I had written down on a piece of paper, with my goal about finishing that manuscript, what were my key motivations? I tried to identify at the very beginning what were the things that motivated me, so that now, in the season when I wanted to quit, give the money back to the publisher, and just maybe do it next year, I didn’t. I said, “Yeah, those are still important to me.” I re-engaged with the manuscript, I ended up being about four weeks later in turning it in, but the book went on to be a New York Times bestseller, and I am so glad that I finished. It would not have happened if I wasn’t able to reconnect with my why. It sounds like the common thread through all of what we’ve talked about is the importance of just taking charge, not letting things happen to you, but making the things happen yourself. I think this is one of the things we have to remind ourselves about. If all you do is watch the evening news, you would get the sense that the world is out of control, and maybe you, or a lot of people, are just victims. We don’t have any agency, we don’t have any control, we don’t have any business to change the outcome. One of the thing that I learned from Dr. Stephen Covey years ago was the difference between your circle of concern and your circle of influence. There’s a lot of things that are happening in the world right now that may concern me, but I don’t have any influence over them. So, largely it’s a waste of time for me to think about them. There’s a lot of stuff where I do have influence, where I do have control, and those are the things that need to be occupying most of my thinking. That’s where I can make a change, that’s where I can improve the quality of my life, that’s where I can impact the people that I love the most, and the people that I can influence.

Marvell Allen: “If I respect, I can influence better.” Marvell Allen is the founder of Millennium Career Advantage , a professional coaching firm in the San Francisco Bay Area. Marvell came to Evernote’s Redwood City headquarters to talk about developing influence in the workplace, and what she had to say was so compelling we immediately invited her to join us on the podcast. In a conversation with LeTisha Shaw from Evernote’s growth team, Marvell shared her advice for recognizing, developing, and harnessing the influence all of us already have, whether we realize it or not. And these ideas apply whether you’re an executive or a junior employee. How do you personally define influence? For me, I believe that my ability to influence effectively and successfully starts with sincerity, authenticity and passion about whatever it is that I’m involved in. I believe that I need to find out more about what other people are interested in and what’s important to them, so that I can do the requisite homework to be in the mode where they are. There are so many stereotypes about management and influence. People believe only a certain segment of an organization A, can be leaders or B, can be managers and C, can have any influence in the organization. But if we’re paying attention with enough sensitivity about what really happens in organizational culture, and what the political realities are in organizations, often times it’s the so called “lower level employees” who have the most influence. One of the current clients that we have has brought Millennium Career Advantage in to design a leadership development program, and the unique thing about this program is that everyone in it self-selected, meaning they said, “Oh, I want to be in that program.” And they were at all levels of the organization. We have two clerks sitting right next to people who are directors. And what this organization decided was [they] need everyone in the organization to have leadership development skills, to care about leadership, to be sensitive and have awareness around what’s important. That means you’re not cutting out that group that stereotypically would be perceived as only serving the organization. They can now “grow up” to be seen as potential leaders because they have the same information, have the same experiences, and work on the same projects as the people that we generally think about in terms of leadership. “If I respect, I can influence better. If I care about what this manager or person thinks about, and I’ve listened to them carefully, I’m probably going to have more success in influencing them.” It sounds like what you’re saying, Marvell, is it’s just not enough to do a good job. Influence is really an important part of your job. Now, do you see influence as the same as respect? I think that you don’t go very far influencing anyone if no one has respect for you. That’s number one. Number two, you don’t go very far in influencing if you don’t have respect for the people you’re trying to influence. I try to tell people, particularly with my coaching clients who may say, “I don’t really like that manager. How can I influence them?” I say, “Move aside your personal emotional feelings about that manager, unless there are ethical issues that you have with them. […] You need to think about the role that you’re in and the job that needs to be done, but you have respect for them, you work with them and you try to get to a place politically where you can respect one another.” That means you find out a little bit more about them. What do they care about? Then give them information about you without backing down and making it seem like what they believe is more important than you. You need to be confident when you let them know that what they believe is just one side of the coin and your beliefs are also one side. If I respect, I can influence better. If I care about what this manager or person thinks about, and I’ve listened to them carefully, I’m probably going to have more success in influencing them. We realize that we don’t all work in isolation. We have to be part of a team. What are some of the unique challenges that you see in order for teams to work together work more effectively? That’s a great question. Many organizations for many, many years would do this whole thing called team building. “Let’s do a team building, and that will create the opportunity for us to all have the Kumabaya moment, and huggy-touchy-kissy-body and we’re all great with one another.” The challenge with that was when it was a one-off and it did not have continual reinforcement around support for and respect for the differences that the various team members brought, then it, in many cases, failed. What I love about group coaching is we take some of those key components of coaching and work with people where they are. I may be brought in to work with a team that needs to learn how to listen better to their colleagues. We insist that they listen to the issues and concerns of their colleagues, and we also do a little bit of peer coaching because you may have had an experience that I bring up, and I need to be open enough to hear what your recommendation is or how you dealt with that issue. It creates an opportunity for an intact team to be able to talk with one another in a confidential setting. You have myself and my colleague as the facilitators of their discussion as opposed to the complete giver of all the information. When we’re in the one-on-one mode, many people who are coached think that their coach is the expert and should tell them everything. But we need to ask the appropriate questions for them to come to those answers themselves. I think the same happens in a group coaching setting. But then I think the other piece is: to what extent are you moving this team to action? Is it just a session where everyone complains and then you leave and say, “Well, I feel better?” If they’re to be moved to some kind of action on behalf of a project or on behalf of an initiative or just on behalf of them all working together, that becomes really important. “Leadership development programs are only as good as the follow up that happens. Just doing the task management doesn’t make them a leader. It makes them a very good task manager.” I have another client that I’ll be doing some group coaching sessions with and they will all be topic focused. One might be conflict and how we manage conflict. Not resolve conflict. Usually for leaders and managers, we need to be in a position of managing conflict to the extent that we can and let the people below us gain those skills to resolve. But one group is here, one’s here, one’s here, and they don’t know how to manage the conflict because they haven’t gotten past the emotion of, “It’s your fault. It’s not my fault. I’m not taking the blame.” Group coaching is going to allow them an opportunity to hear from one another, hear the different perspectives. You get to now see that they’ve got some of the same challenges you do, and now what are we going to do to solve those challenges? It’s not, “Let’s give you a performance evaluation. You don’t do good in this, you don’t do good in that.” No. Let’s give them the skills to make changes on their own, and have them support one another on their own, with a little bit of facilitated support. Then, there will be lots of follow up because leadership development programs are only as good as the follow up that happens. If you do not have it, it allows people to just walk away and go back to doing their work. Just doing the task management doesn’t make them a leader. It makes them a very good task manager. That’s all it makes them. Let’s say that I’m doing my homework and I’m practicing the principles around mastering influence, and I’m using my powers for good, not for evil. Now, there could be someone in my organization that is now starting to resent the influence that I’m starting to have. How do I deal with that? I had that example when I was at a [previous] company. We were both at the same level. Both of us were director-level in the field and what I thought was that here was an opportunity to build a great relationship with someone who’d already been at the organization a long time, so I could learn where the political minefields were. I had many things that I believed I could give to that person as well. As it turned out, that person did not agree with me. They did watch me build more influence, but did not pay attention to how I was doing it. They felt they were losing the influence that they had. Once it finally came to a head, I decided I had to think about what was really in their mind. Did they have an insecurity that maybe they would be usurped on certain projects or they should have a better relationship with the boss than I did? I decided to call them out, in a good sense: “Hey, I’d love to work with you on this project. Do I have enough information? What do you recommend?” And use them as my sounding board. That worked only for a bit. [In the end,] what I decided to do was go to where I had my base — the managers that I was working with and their direct reports — and get them to understand what I was looking to do and get their support on it, so that it would nullify the potential for backstabbing. I needed to build some support in a very authentic way that would not put a negative bias on her, but would continue to show that my heart was in the right place. Allies are critical because if I’m building influence, I’ve got to have people that I trust and I feel comfortable with, that will let me be vulnerable to get information, and I have to be okay with hearing them say, “No. Sorry, that sucks. You don’t want to do that.” I need to respect where they’re going to take me, then I need to come back to them and said, “Okay. I heard you. Here’s what I’m doing. Now, what do you think about these things.” To hear our complete conversation with Marvell Allen, click the player above or download Taking Note from iTunes , SoundCloud , Overcast , or your podcast platform of choice.", "date": "2018-04-4,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How Evernote’s CEO Stays Productive All Week Long", "author": ["Chris O'Neill"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/evernotes-ceo-stays-productive-week-long/", "abstract": "This article originally appeared in Fast Company . I have over 10,000 notes in my Evernote account, including everything from work to-do lists, goals, and meeting materials to bills and my children’s artwork. That may sound like a jumbled nightmare, but I’ve figured out how to make it all work for me. After all, it would be a shame if I couldn’t. As the CEO of Evernote, it’s my job to help others control information overload and gain back a little more time in the process. Here are a few of the ways I’ve learned to stay organized and productive, both inside Evernote and in the wider world. Assign each weekday a theme It’s easy to get sucked into an endless cycle of emails and obligations. To avoid falling into this trap, I assign a “theme” that I focus on each day. Mondays are for taking care of the business side of Evernote. This typically involves weekly leadership meetings and one-on-ones with my team, where I help solve problems, move things forward, and discuss ideas about how to innovate or move faster. Tuesdays are blocked off for a weekly all-hands meeting with the entire company, including our global offices, which join via video stream. This meeting is about celebrating our employees and their accomplishments as well as ensuring we’re all on the same page when it comes to our strategy and long-term mission. Wednesdays are reserved for marketing and our go-to-market efforts. We’re lucky because most of Evernote’s growth is organic and happens through word of mouth. I typically devote Wednesdays to planning how to put that user feedback into action. For instance, last year, our Android users were very vocal about wanting a fingerprint-scanning feature, so we prioritized it in the roadmap and built it for them. That was a Wednesday project. I split Thursdays between product and recruiting. This is when I’ll typically do a deeper dive into our product roadmap and examine the progress we’re making. We’re actively recruiting across all functions and regions, so I also spend Thursdays meeting candidates and partnering with our People team to run a smooth hiring and onboarding process. And finally, on Fridays, I handle anything that didn’t get done earlier in the week. I also use Friday afternoons to reflect back on the week and prepare for what’s to come in the week ahead. Of course, I know there will be times when I go off track—it’s bound to happen. But organizing my week thematically at least gives me a plan to stick to. Plan ahead and prioritize I probably oversee about nine different Google calendars (which are, of course, integrated into Evernote) that reflect the different roles in my life: Some are for work, others are for travel and my personal obligations, and others cover my kids’ sports schedules. I set up my work calendars to take into account what my quarterly goals are for myself and my team—this way I can see that I’m making an impact over the long term. I also make sure I have enough time to achieve everything my team and I planned to do day-to-day. Resist letting emails dictate the workday As a rule, I try to resist checking my email first thing in the morning. Instead, I consult my #TomorrowList, which I write the night before. This list simply spells out my top three priorities for the day, in order of importance. I try to tackle the hardest problem that requires the most energy and creativity first, to get it out of the way. It’s been said that your email inbox is other people’s to-do list for you, and I feel like that’s certainly true. I try to check my email just twice a day, and use a modified version of the Getting Things Done (GTD) method in order to stick to that. I’ve also set up automatic filters to reroute emails to the appropriate folders. I have two simple rules for dealing with email: If it takes two minutes or less, I deal with it immediately. Everything else, I route to someone else on my team or send to my Evernote to deal with later. Otherwise I just archive it. I’ve found that emailing during the day brings more chaos into my routine than I need. Keep meetings to a minimum My teams used to hold biweekly status updates with dozens of people, but I realized this was a waste of everyone’s time. Now, I limit meetings to eight people and maintain a “no agenda, no attendance” policy: If the meeting host doesn’t share an agenda beforehand that makes it clear what the meeting is for and what they need, I don’t attend. For the meetings that I do attend, I make sure there’s a designated notetaker who can later share their notes and action items afterward. Taken together, this approach works for me, but everybody’s different. Still, I believe that there’s no such thing as an inherently productive or unproductive person—there are just methods that improve how well you work, or don’t. The key is finding the right combination for you.", "date": "2018-04-10,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Make Evernote Fit Your Myers-Briggs Personality Type", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/make-evernote-fit-your-personality-type/", "abstract": "There was a time when people entered the workforce knowing that they would be treated pretty much as interchangeable corporate drones for the rest of their working lives. Fortunately, today companies are increasingly interested in understanding—and categorizing—personalities. And the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, which was developed by a mother/daughter team of researchers in 1944, became the gold standard for figuring out personality types. You’ve probably taken a Myers-Briggs test at some point, and found it enlightening. If not, stop reading and take it now . Come back with your results when you’re done. Who are you, anyway? We’ve all encountered a variety of office personalities, and learned, often through trial and error, how to work with different types of people. Maybe you’ve learned never to talk to your co-worker before she’s had her first cup of coffee, or perhaps you know a colleague who is going to be so full of ideas that the meeting run long. Or you’ve learned that your boss doesn’t appreciate being put on the spot at a meeting—she prefers time to prepare her answers. The Myers-Briggs test is designed to get the root of this problem, quantifying and demystifying  personality types through a series of questions, and answers: Are you an introvert or extrovert ? That score gives you your first letter: I for introverted, or E for extroversion. Whether you’re a thinking or feeling type, that is, do you think with your head or your heart? From that, you get your second letter, T or F. Are you more likely to make a snap judgment, or take a wait and see attitude? That’s your judging or p erceiving score, or letters J or P. Do you follow your instincts or only what you can literally see before you? Your Myers-Briggs score will tell you whether you tend toward sensing (S), or intuition (N). These concepts fascinated Evernote Certified Consultant Enrico Nahler, who believes that people work better within Evernote if they interact with information in a way that matches their personality type. He helps his clients understand Myers-Briggs, and how to customize Evernote for work styles that best suit them. Grouping the groups With so many personality styles, others have found it easier to group them into fewer personality types using the DISC test . DISC stands for Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness, Enrico uses this test to group similar Myers-Briggs scores together. You might never expect to find common ground between introverts and extroverts, but using this complementary test, “Let’s take a look at the ‘D’ type ,” Enrico begins. “D stands for several ‘D’ words: Dominant. Direct. Demanding. Decisive. Determined. These people are typically outgoing and task oriented.” D is for decisiveness—but not details D-types, or ‘dominance’ types, typically fall into Myers-Briggs as ISTP or ESTP , ISFP , or ESFP ,” he explains. “These are the types of people who end up on company boards or in leadership roles.” D’s prefer: Bulleted lists High-level ideas Big-picture scenarios Action-oriented speech—what can they do right now? There is one ‘D’ that Enrico says this type has no interest in: details. So when working with someone in one of these groups, keep your communications simple, and easily digestible. Spare them the trivia. Video: Create a Checklist in Evernote>> Influencing the Influencers I-types, or ‘influencers’, are diplomat types that map to Myers-Briggs INFJ , ENFJ , INFP , and ENFP types. Using popular literature and culture, you can look to the Harry Potter series to find a classic Influencer in ENFJ Dumbledore, and, if you prefer a Star Wars metaphor, in classic INFJ Obi-Wan Kenobi. I-types are, according to Enrico, “influencing, impressive, and interested.” These people, he continues, are charismatic spokespeople and natural communicators and diplomats. Influencers are most satisfied with: Quick and structured information about the topics at hand and the people they’ll be speaking with. CRM-like templates that provide names, technical data, how a person is involved with a company or project. Photos, diagrams, and as much information about individuals as possible. Too little information, Enrico warned, will make people in these groups feel unprepared. Too much information can befuddle them. But since their natural calling is to bring people together, giving them the details in structured formats will make them feel comfortable enough to absorb and act on the material happily. Dashboards for Sentinels The S-type—aptly named for their “steady” nature, is, according to the DISC test, supportive, stable, sensitive, fans of the status quo, or sentinels. They are the specialists. S-types, Enrico says, tend to be people who value responsibility and commitments, and score as a Myers-Briggs type ISFJ . “People who fall into this one group tend to be dentists, librarians, nurses, elementary school teachers, accountants, franchise owners,” Enrico explained. This type of person: Works best within a predefined set of rules Need checklists and dashboards Work well with systems Like to make order of chaos As an example, he mentions teachers. “Teachers need to keep lesson plans,” Enrico says. “They can keep a whole year’s worth of lessons in Evernote, in a single dashboard note, with links out to the actual materials. Then, they can follow the plan and check each lesson off when it’s done.” Once the teacher completes a lesson, he or she just checks off the lesson in the dashboard.” Take a look at Enrico’s video on how to create an Evernote dashboard >> C for “Customized” Task-oriented, more reserved personalities, often software developers, creatives, and bankers are people who tend to want to do things their own way, and quietly bristle against the tyranny of forms and systems. The are the C-types, or the Myers-Briggs INTJ, INTP , ENTJ , and ENTP s. Enrico calls them contemplative, careful, calculating, and cautious. People who fall into this category: Strive for accuracy and tend to be very thorough Need as much information and detail as possible to be effective Fear criticism and can take it very hard Like to work in free-form environments, without adherence to structured templates or systems When we compare these traits with someone from the ‘D’ group, it’s easy to see where conflicts happen and coworkers can become frustrated with one another. This is why it’s helpful for us to understand other people’s personality types so we can be better about giving our colleagues with work the way they best approach it. For example, you may not want to send a detailed report to your ESTP manager. He or she may become frustrated with what they see as unnecessary information—they just want high-level takeaways. On the other side, as a manager, you may find it difficult to get your ENTPs to work happily within a highly-regimented project management system. Enrico recommends developing templates in Evernote that help each different personality work in a way that makes them the most productive. Sometimes you may need to adapt your work style to better suit someone else—if you’re a freeform-loving C-type, you may want to create dashboards lists for your S-type team member to get the best results. Taking that extra step shows not only a concern and understanding of other people’s personality styles, it shows a willingness to collaborate and work as a team to get things done in an efficient and drama-free way. And that’s something every personality type can agree on. For more information about Myers-Briggs: Take a free personality test at 16personalities.com.

Inc.com voted it one of the top 35 business podcasts of all time. The podcast is released twice a week, and topics include everything from social media, to content marketing, SEO, and more. There are over 350 episodes and people around the globe rely on it to polish their digital marketing skills. The Bacon Podcast is written and produced by Brian Basilico, a well-known and highly respected web marketing professional. He has been on the beat for over twenty years and was, in fact, an early innovator in the web marketing space. So what’s with the bacon? Brian says he wants “to make your business sizzle,” and Evernote is his favorite tool for turning up the heat: “If your business needs more organization, searchability, and share-ability, you should be using Evernote.” Sharing with clients, one at a time Beyond the podcast, Brian also does one-on-one consulting and marketing webinars. He has built his business by staying organized and being able to focus on each client individually. One of the features Brian uses all the time is notebook sharing . He creates a notebook for each client and shares it with them exclusively. It makes each relationship personal. The shared notebook is a singular, go-to place for everything Brian and his clients need to share. And for reference 24/7, desktop or mobile, every coaching session lives in the client’s notebook. “Every time we meet, I create a new note and I put it into a notebook that is shared specifically with just that client so only that client can see the notes,” he says. “They can easily log in to Evernote and see exactly what was discussed, so the next time that we get together, it’s kind of like their to-do list.” “Evernote was the only thing I could find that made it easy to work across all my computers and platforms at the same time. The portability was huge.” I’d like one app with everything, please Like so many business leaders, Brian tried a variety of different tools, all designed with the promise of keeping him on track and organized. Each of these tools did something well. However, the one feature missing was their ability to play well with others. There were overlaps in capabilities but not one of them had the complete suite of features Brian was looking for. And using multiple applications added up to multiple headaches: “Evernote was the only thing I could find that made it easy to work across all my computers and platforms at the same time,” he says. “The portability was huge.” Another feature that has proven to be a big time saver and a great benefit to his clients is Web Clipper : “One of the things about web pages is you can go visit it today and it could change tomorrow; but if there’s something you want to capture right now in its current state, Web Clipper will keep an archive of exactly the way it looked at the moment that you clipped it.” Always know where to look When asked what advice he would offer anyone just getting started with Evernote, Brian says it’s all about notebooks and notebook stacks: “Organization is so incredibly important. The first thing I would do starting out is think about the big things; the areas of your personal life or your business that you need to focus on. Then put together a notebook for each category and start depositing notes into it. This way you don’t have to go back and organize notes later. Think of verticals that have a common theme, then add multiple notebooks that can fit under that as well.” In Brian’s system, a stack would cover a broad topic area like ‘marketing’ or ‘new products.’ Within that stack are notebooks for related subtopics. For example in your ‘new products’ stack, you may have notebooks for ‘developers’ or ‘prototypes.’ The digital hub of your workplace Brian’s story reflects what we’ve always believed: that capturing and sharing information makes Evernote a natural information hub for your business. Evernote Premium puts Brian in control—confident that his plans, documents, next steps, and anything he needs to share are stored and searchable in one place.

Know Yourself Better", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/want-to-shed-a-bad-habit/", "abstract": "You can get rid of a bad habit and form new, positive ones through a series of scientific experiments, says Tiago Forte, a San Francisco-based productivity expert. He should know. In his quest to help others become more productive, he’s taken some hard looks at his own life and change some behaviors. If you look at your habits through a filter of data, he says, instead of through a lens of guilt and shame, changing habits can be a fascinating experience. In a recent episode of Evernote Facebook Live, Tiago opened up about changing habits through self-evaluation, how to reframe the meaning of productivity, and the importance of understanding our beverage habits. How to Form Habits The only way to really stay productive is by forming habits. But what steps do you need to take to change your behavior? Join us for a conversation with Tiago Forte who’ll talk about how to form new habits, what role technology plays in habit formation, and how to change your behavior once and for all.Update: Here are all the resources mentioned in this event → http://bit.ly/2hPE8K1 Posted by Evernote on Friday, July 14, 2017 Tiago, whose eclectic background ranges from teaching to the Peace Corps to entrepreneurship, today owns Forte Labs San Francisco, and his mission is to transform people’s productivity. “I’m not talking about just tweaks,” Tiago says. “We take productivity to a new level.” Understanding the Habit Loop “The topic of behavior change is a weird, academic field that not many people know about,” Tiago explains. “But what could be more fundamental? We have behaviors that aren’t servicing us. Getting rid of them and replacing them with habits that are is behavior change. A habit is really just your own behavior, and you think you don’t have much control over it other than that you just decide to do one thing and stop doing something else. In reality, habits require some design thinking.” In his research into habits, Tiago came to understand what he calls the habit loop, a series of cues and triggers that drive our behavior. The habit loop, which he’s divided into three parts—trigger, behavior, and reward—are components of behavior change that are all within our control, he maintains. Whether we’re looking to break a habit or form a new one, Tiago breaks down the process. “A trigger is something that reminds you that a behavior is relevant,” he explains. “Like hunger. Your attention is drawn to the fact that you’re hungry and that prompts you to look for food. We have cues and triggers in our environment, but we don’t design them intentionally.” Tiago encourages his students to create triggers that spark a behavior, and then reward yourself when you respond appropriately to it. Hacking dish washing, or, game-ifying your new habit In his class, Tiago asks his students to design an experiment to change a habit. “Know what it is you want to change,” he says. “Choose a behavior that you think will work. You have to think of small things that make the habit you want to develop more interesting. Can you find something in the new habit that interests you?” He gives an example from his own life, that of washing dishes. It’s a task that he previously despised and avoided. “Then I thought, ‘I bet there’s a better way to wash dishes.’ I started looking at You Tube videos about how to wash dishes faster, how to hack dishwashing. I managed to make dishwashing a learning opportunity, and now it’s like a game. The game was the reward.” To Tiago, the science of changing habits is simple. “In the habit loop model, there are only three stages, and you can change any of them,” he explains. “If you want to change a habit, you could make yourself aware of the trigger, and change your response to it. If the reward isn’t motivating enough, change the reward if you successfully do the behavior.” Identify the true need your habit meets Designing good habits is something we all want to do, but the more important (and more difficult) act is breaking bad habits. Here, the principles of human nature came in handy as he examined his own life. “I thought I drank too much coffee,” he remembers. “I said, let me go on a coffee detox for two weeks. I couldn’t do it.” To understand why this habit was so hard to break, he started researching what made the coffee habit so strong. Breaking it down, he realized that it wasn’t the beverage itself that was at the heart of the habit, but the ancillary human needs it fulfilled.  “It was something to motivate me to work,” he says. “It was a treat. “It helped me to focus and pay attention to one thing for a long time. It suppressed my appetite. It was social; I could meet friends for coffee.” That’s when Tiago reached his breakthrough: coffee wasn’t meeting his needs. It was the other aspects that surrounded coffee that he craved. “I could not break this habit until all of these needs were satisfied elsewhere. That’s how a bad habit can have such a good design that you think it fulfills all these needs.” Diamonds are forever, not habits Not every habit is meant to be a lifetime change, Tiago says, and that’s fine. Sometimes you only need to develop a habit for a certain period of time, so if you break it, the habit may have outlived its usefulness. “We walk more when the weather gets warmer,” he offers, adding, “nobody gets upset when we stop doing these walks when it gets cold.” The habit, he says, was designed for the summer only, and if you did it, it’s a success. And sometimes, he adds, habit-breaking is just an experiment. It doesn’t have to be a resolution. If you undertake a habit that isn’t working for you, stop. After all, you’re in control of the experiment. “I read that you’re supposed to drink eight glasses of water a day,” Tiago says. “I decided to try it for 30 days. I ended up saying ‘no thanks’ to that. You end up going to the bathroom a lot. But you can’t be disappointed in yourself if you decide a habit isn’t for you. At the end of the 30 days, deciding to stop is a success.” Take control of your habits Tiago has learned a lot about people in his practice teaching others about habits. And he’s learned a great deal about himself, too, which has in turn helped with his teaching. One of the most important things he’s discovered is that something that works for one person may not work for another. “People are so different,” he muses. “We assume that habit changing techniques are universal, and that’s crazy. That’s why experimental habit formation is so important. When you take control over your habits, it becomes more conscious. You become better at forgiving yourself. The biggest problem with not changing your behaviors is the shame and guilt you feel when you think you’ve failed. And that,” he cautions, “is in itself a habit. The reward of shame is that you don’t have to change anything.” The reward of shame is that you don’t have to change anything.—Tiago Forte The Quantified Self A proponent of a new style of measuring our behaviors called QS, or the Quantified Self, Tiago encourages people to use technology to measure things that could never be captured before. Social media helps take this data and makes us more accountable for it. “Sharing your exercise data from your Fitbit or your sleep tracker is an example,” Tiago says. “Not only are you putting your behavior change out there for the world to see, it’s a way of learning from others. Other people are working on a habit that’s different from yours, but you can still apply what they’re learning to yourself.” QS is a movement that Tiago has embraced himself. “Sometimes I try to figure out why I feel a certain way,” he says. “There’s an app that lets you pick a color to represent your mood. Over time, it creates an animation that moves you through these colors, like a little movie of your moods. I can see if I feel different at noon, or when I’m at home, and I find and opportunities to find new habits.” He is careful, however, not to draw conclusions from his results, because the correlations aren’t always there. “If I skip breakfast one day and then go to bed late, is there really a correlation?” he asks. “Not always. Sometimes it’s best just to have the self-knowledge by itself.” Tracking and accounting for habits is just one part of the productivity classes that Tiago teaches. After a successful series of video classes, he’s decided to teach in-person five-week “boot camps” on the full spectrum of personal knowledge management called Building a Second Brain. The boot camp explores habit creation, and also covers skills people need to process and make sense of the enormous amount of information we all work with every day. Some of the concepts he teaches in that class include centralizing notes (Tiago is an Evernote power user) to help people find information more easily, and how to break down large quantities of information using a technique he calls “progressive summarization.” “It’s quite simple,” Tiago says. “Just highlight the most interesting part of (your notes), then (highlight) the most interesting part of that. What we’re talking about is compression. There’s no limit to how much you can compress information…if you break it into pieces, you think in terms of little micro modules you can snap together like Legos. Snap those compressions together, and something new can emerge.” “ Building a Second Brain ” is a live class that Tiago offers in San Francisco, but his online courses are available through his website, Fortelabs.co.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Learning From the Feynman Technique", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/learning-from-the-feynman-technique/", "abstract": "They called Feynman the “Great Explainer.” Richard Feynman (1918-1988), an author , graphic novel hero , intellectual, philosopher, physicist, and No Ordinary Genius is considered to be one of the most important physicists of all time. He pioneered an entire field: quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the 1940s, his invention of the Feynman Diagram helped bring much-needed visual clarification to the enigmatic behavior of subatomic particles. His work helping scientists understand the interaction of light and matter earned him a share of a Nobel Prize in 1965. His work has directly influenced the fields of nanotechnology, quantum computing, and particle physics. In 1986, his research and explanations were critical in helping to understand the cause of the space shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his groundbreaking research, Feynman was brilliant, eloquent, and an exquisitely passionate thinker. In the world of science, he stands unequivocally for his ability to synthesize and explain complex scientific knowledge. His lectures are the stuff of legend — Albert Einstein attended Feynman’s first talk as a graduate student, and Bill Gates was so inspired by his pedagogy that he called Feynman , “the greatest teacher I never had.” Gates purchased the rights to his lectures and made them publicly available on a video portal nicknamed “Tuva” in honor of Feynman’s famous failed quest to reach the Russian region later in his life. “I do think that making science cool to people when they’re young and therefore getting more people to go into it in an in-depth way, I think that’s very important right now,” Gates said , when announcing the purchase. Feynman’s lectures, many of which were delivered during his time at California Institute of Technology , were aimed at students who had no previous knowledge of particle physics or deep science. Taking the mystery out of complex scientific principles was Feynman’s forte. His lectures were underscored by a conviction and passion for science. If Einstein created the ‘ beautiful equation ,’ then Feynman brought an unparalleled sense of beauty and romanticism previously absent in the world of scientific research. A vast majority of Feynman’s life was as vividly eccentric and illustrious as the unpredictable movements of the atomic particles that defined his life’s work. When he wasn’t in the throes of researching particle physics, he spent significant time dabbling in the arts, sketching, and even playing the bongo. The Feynman Technique Have you ever had a coworker who used business-speak, or had a teacher explain something with language that was difficult to understand? You’re not alone. The Feynman technique for teaching and communication is a mental model (a breakdown of his personal thought process) to convey information using concise thoughts and simple language. This technique is derived from Feynman’s studying methods when he was a student at Princeton. At Princeton, Feynman started to record and connect the things he did know with those he did not. In the end, Feynman had a comprehensive notebook of subjects that had been disassembled, translated, and recorded. In James Gleick’s biography of Feynman, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman, he recalled his subject’s technique. “He opened a fresh notebook. On the title page he wrote: NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DON’T KNOW ABOUT . For the first but not last time he reorganized his knowledge. He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and putting them back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsistencies. He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject,” Gleick wrote . You can use this model to quickly learn new concepts, shore up knowledge gaps you have (known as targeted learning), recall ideas you don’t want to forget, or to study more efficiently . Taking that concept further, you can use this technique to grapple with tough subject matter, which is one of the great barriers to learning. Feynman’s technique is also useful for those who find writing a challenge. Feynman had an interesting relationship with writing . Instead of committing his knowledge to paper like many other scientific figures, he chose to use speech as the foundation for many of his published works. He dictated most of his books and memoirs, and his scientific papers were transcribed from his lectures. “In order to talk to each other, we have to have words, and that’s all right. It’s a good idea to try to see the difference, and it’s a good idea to know when we are teaching the tools of science, such as words, and when we are teaching science itself,” Feynman said . Feynman relied heavily on verbal and spoken communication, and when he turned to his cartoonish diagrams of highly scientific principles, for example, he could tap into ideas with shapes, squiggly lines, and drawings. It stripped away clunky language and allowed the power of verbal storytelling to take root. Explaining the essentials of particle physics is extremely difficult. Before Feynman’s diagrams that earned him a Nobel Prize, there wasn’t a clear way to explain their meaning. Attribution for Feynman diagram: By JabberWok at the English language Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1601027 This is the first-ever published diagram by Feynman helped scientists track particle movements in illustrations and visual equations rather than verbose explanations. What seemed almost improbable at the time is now one of the greatest explanations of particle physics — the squiggly lines, diagrams, arrows, quarks, and cartoonish figures are now the established nomenclature and visual story that students, scientists, and readers will see when they learn about this field of science. Essentially, the Feynman Technique is this: 1. Identify the subject Write down everything you know about the topic. Each time you run into new sources of information, add them to the note. 2. Teach it to a child If you can teach a concept to a child, you’re way ahead of the game. Start with a blank note and write the topic or subject you want to teach. Then, below that topic, write everything you know about it. But, the trick is to write it plainly and simply —so that a child can understand what you’re talking about. Doing this takes into consideration a few things: Speaking in plain terms: Children don’t understand jargon or a lexicon of dense vocabulary. Science is full of complex terminology, which is the reason Feynman’s diagrams became so valuable. His charts illustrated things that other scientists delivered marathon lectures about. When we speak without jargon, it frees us from hiding behind knowledge we don’t have. Big words and fluffy “business speak” cripples us from getting to the point and passing knowledge to others. Brevity: The attention span of a child requires you to deliver concepts as if you were pitching a business idea during one short elevator ride. You better get the concept out before those doors open. Children also don’t have the ability — or mental capacity, to understand anything longer than that. If you had difficulty putting thoughts into your note, that shows you have room to improve. This is also where the power of creativity can help you reach new heights in learning. For Feynman, much of the pleasure in science was in this first step —unraveling his levels of understanding. 3. Identify your knowledge gaps This is the point where the real learning happens. What are you missing? What don’t you know? Highlighting knowledge gaps will help you when you collect and organize your notes into a cohesive story (which is the next step.) Now you can call upon your source material (lecture notes, ideas, etc.) when you run into questions about how much you do know about your topic. If you don’t know something, hit the books. Go back to the source material and compile information that will help you fill in the cracks. 4. Organize + simplify + Tell a story Start to tell your story. Piece together your notes and begin to spin a tale using concise explanations. Bring the most vital pieces of your knowledge about the topic together. Practice reading your story out loud. Pretend to tell the story to a classroom of students. That way, you’ll hear where language stops being simple. Stumbles could indicate incomplete thoughts. Use analogies and simple sentences to strengthen your understanding of the story. This sentence, written by Feynman, encapsulates the power of this technique. What started as a question about our existence has been translated into a single sentence that can be understood by a middle school student. “All things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.” Basically, Feynman says that if you know nothing about physics, the most essential scientific knowledge to understand is that everything is made up of atoms. In one simple sentence, Feynman conveys the foundational existence of our universe. It’s a master class not just for scientists, but for writers of any stripe. Get to the hypothesis in as few words as possible. Avoid clunky, verbose language. Drawing on passions Feynman was a believer in a multi-disciplinary approach to learning and found connections to his work in creative outlets like drawing and music. He never stopped asking questions— who, what, and why? Einstein had his violin. Werner Heisenberg played the piano. Richard Feynman had bongos. And a passion for art. He was able to eloquently communicate, but he could also see the beauty in art, and the stories that art tells. It was as much a distraction as much as it was an unending source of inspiration he could connect to his work in particle physics. “I wanted very much to learn to draw, for a reason that I kept to myself: I wanted to convey an emotion I have about the beauty of the world. It’s difficult to describe because it’s an emotion. … It’s a feeling of awe — of scientific awe — which I felt could be communicated through a drawing to someone who had also had that emotion. I could remind him, for a moment, of this feeling about the glories of the universe.” — Feynman discussing the intersection of art and science. Making things stick forever The next time you stare at an empty notebook page, think about turning that page into an opportunity. As Feynman illustrates in his mental model, learning can be a lifelong pursuit. This technique is designed to help you study for exams and learn new subjects, but it can be easily adapted to pursue deep work . Dedicating a notebook to a place where your knowledge can grow and evolve your ideas and provide inspiration to continue following a path of ongoing learning critical to the fundamentals of deeper, meaningful work. Today, researchers are still parsing through Thomas Edison’s notebooks and are constantly learning about how he cataloged his ideas and innovations. For Feynman, after he was done cataloging his knowledge with his technique, he had a comprehensive record of his knowledge that became a notebook he was incredibly proud of.

For more than 500 years, his plays have been performed in virtually every country on the planet in a myriad of languages on stage, on film, on television, radio, and the internet. The words and phrases he coined are part of our everyday usage, and thanks to the ways the media now surround us, may be more relevant in the 21st century than ever. Working every day in the theatre, Shakespeare knew what his audiences wanted to hear and see, and was able to structure his plays (and the information inside them) to give them what they wanted in a way they were able to understand it. It’s not for nothing that one of his best-loved comedies is titled As You Like It . Let’s take a look at how Shakespeare worked, and how we can still take lessons from one of the world’s greatest writers. “ We know what we are, but know not what we may be” Shakespeare’s plays are divided into many scenes over five acts. The basic formula of setting up the situation in a plot, exploring complications, and resolving them is all Shakespeare needed for timeless storytelling. Though he wrote great poetry for the theatre, you don’t need to be a poet to tell stories just as effectively as Shakespeare did. Understanding how he organized and communicated his stories gives you a good starting point for any of your own writing or communication projects. It’s true that preparing a report for the boss isn’t as difficult as writing Hamlet or King Lear (at least, let’s hope not). But you can take a lesson from Shakespeare’s practice of drawing from varied sources, knowing his audience, giving them a good story, and drawing on the strengths of those he was working with. These are techniques anyone can apply to any task. Shakespeare guides us through his work Shakespeare organized his plays and characters so audiences could easily gather all the information they need about them and their circumstances. A perfect example is how his characters speak. Shakespeare gave audiences clues about who was who, and what was what. Upper-class characters and royalty spoke in iambic pentameter (that is, ten syllables in a line, alternating in stress: “to BE or NOT to BE; THAT is the QUEStion”). When the characters break that pattern, either with more or fewer syllables, or a change of meter, it was a clue to the audience that something was up. Maybe it meant that the character was really a member of a lower class, disguised as a noble. On the other hand, lower-class characters spoke in prose, the language of everyday people. Most of Shakespeare’s plays work on more than one level. While there’s the main plot, there’s also a subtext that is a reflection of what was going on in the society at that time. For example, Shakespeare knew his audience at the time (late 16th and early 17th centuries) was preoccupied with who Queen Elizabeth’s successor to the throne would be and they were anxious about other current events, too. He used his plays to comment on these events. A reader or audience member who knows those contexts adds more depth and interest to their enjoyment of each of them. “Take heed, be wary how you place your words” or, Shakespeare’s lessons for today In the same way that 21st-century companies search for the latest trends and innovations, Elizabethan producers were always on the lookout for new plays. They had to find material where they could. Of the 37 plays credited to Shakespeare, not one used an original plot. All were taken from previous best-selling and popular plays or (his most pillaged source) Holinshead’s Chronicles , a history of Britain. In adapting his plots from existing sources, Shakespeare was using material his audiences were already familiar with. They already knew the plot of Hamlet or the stories of what King Henry V had done when audiences came to the Globe Theatre. The question for them was how Shakespeare was going to use those stories to comment on what was going on in society. To do this, he had to reframe the information by transforming it into a narrative that combined prose and poetry. He cut out what was irrelevant or useless, and emphasized those things that would both make his points and entertain his audience. Since that audience was made up of all parts of society — from the “groundlings” who paid a penny (about the price of a loaf of bread) to nobles (who paid six pennies for a cushioned seat) — Shakespeare had to make sure that his ideas were expressed in language that any of them could understand. This technique was especially important because people were hearing those words for the first time, and just once. Those audiences didn’t have the luxury of reading the script beforehand or replaying something they’d missed. Every thought had to be expressed in language that was clear and simple enough for everyone to understand right away — despite the poetic flourishes. Shakespeare’s communication techniques — his striving for clarity and simplicity, his use of outside sources, and creating interesting narratives — are timeless. And, just as Shakespeare borrowed from others to make his art, we can borrow from him to make our own messaging lively and engaging. 1. “What’s past is prologue” – Innovate by honoring the past Modern innovators understand that the best way to create breakthroughs is to look for the basic principles underneath technologies and combine old and new ideas in fresh ways. That smartphone in your pocket combines a telephone, a computer, an adding machine, a television, a radio, a phonograph, and a camera into one small package that we can easily comprehend, and is fun to use. It repurposes older technology in new and useful ways. Shakespeare was a firm believer in this principle. If a word didn’t exist to express the idea he wanted to convey, he just made one up by combining old forms or changing the meanings of words. The Shakespeare Online website notes that the Bard “invented over 1700 of our common words by changing nouns into verbs, changing verbs into nouns, and devising words wholly original. A list of those words is staggering; from ‘lonely’ to ‘bedroom’ and from ‘eyeball’ to “skim milk.’ His invention knew almost no end.” This type of thinking may be the ultimate form of innovation: juxtaposing existing ideas in ways that allow the best features of each complement to each other to create new products and concepts that neither could fulfill alone. 2. “Suit the action to the word, the word to the action” – Understand your audience When he sat down to write a play, Shakespeare had to decide which genre he wanted to use. Was his point best made satirically in comedy to show how silly something was? In a tragedy, to show how even the best of intentions can go horribly wrong? Or using the distancing effect of a history to show that modern problems had echoes in the ancient world? He knew his audience well enough to know which of these to use to make his points most effectively. When writing or preparing a presentation, we have to know what our audience is expecting. It’s important to communicate to audiences in terms that will mean the most to them, in the language that will be clearest to them. We have many different ways to send messages now—text, email, verbal communication, a video or slideshow, just to name a few. You probably text your best friend in one style of language and give a presentation to your boss using a more formal tone. So tailor the type of language you use to your audience. There’s no need to get fancy and dazzle your audience with verbal pyrotechnics. They want information in the form that is the simplest and most appropriate for them. It’s up to you to give them what they want. 3. “Search the secret treasures of the world” – Know how to find your information and research Shakespeare borrowed (or stole) his plots and stories from numerous sources. His plays are loaded with references to and comments on then-current events and societal concerns. When it’s your turn to communicate, you may be able to have more impact if you can figure out how to contextualize current events with what’s going on in your company, peer group, or school. Your words become that much more valuable and exciting. You also show that you’ve put in the work, especially if you go beyond the bare basics of looking something up on Wikipedia. Find reputable sources and keep digging. Put the time in to get to know your subject in more depth. Not only will your project have greater insight, but if people have follow-up questions, your command of deep facts will dazzle them. It’ll make you memorable the next time an opportunity comes up. Not everything you communicate will lend itself to a global view, but try to find those places and aspects that will. How many times have audiences been bored to tears by presentations that are nothing but hard numbers and factoids? Who doesn’t love a good narrative that places everything in an interesting context? So far, we’ve discussed many of the techniques Shakespeare used to create his plays and poems—the nuts and bolts of communication. But keeping all of the pieces separately is a little like assembling an IKEA cabinet. You may have the instructions and most of the tools, but you can’t put them together without the most important tool: the Allen wrench. In Shakespeare’s case, that “Allen wrench” is figuring out whether “to collaborate or not to collaborate.” In Part 2 of this post , we’ll discuss how Shakespeare worked together with others (and he did), what to look for in a collaborator, how to work together with others effectively, and the hidden partner that every writer works with, knowingly or not.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "“One business does command us all”: Shakespeare and Collaboration", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/shakespeare-and-collaboration/", "abstract": "In the last post , we discussed how Shakespeare’s communication style made his words timeless, and how you can put some of his techniques to work in your own communications. But Shakespeare was more than a great communicator. Recent research has shown us proof that he was also a great collaborator . Thanks to technology, we can now analyze texts and get a pretty good idea of where one writer leaves off, and another takes over. In fact, there’s evidence that Christopher Marlowe was a co-author of some of the histories. “Prithee, be my present partner in this business” – Look for times and opportunities to collaborate Shakespeare didn’t work alone, and neither should you. The more we learn about the Elizabethan theatre, the more it seems like the writing process worked like a writer’s room on a television series. Writers divvied up various sections of a play according to their strengths and interest: “Jonson, you take Act II, scene 4 and Act IV, scene 1. Fletcher, can you take the rest of Act II? I’ll handle Act III and the end of Act V.” Later, they assembled these pieces production and performance. The result wasn’t a hodgepodge of styles, though. After all the pieces were in, someone (in this case, Shakespeare) probably went over everything to make sure that the tone and language were consistent and coherent. “We shall jointly labour with your soul / To give it due content” – Make sure everyone plays a role Nobody knows everything, so it’s always good to seek help on a project. That help can be as simple as talking over your thoughts with someone over coffee or as complex as heading up a large team. The more viewpoints and group knowledge you can access and the more varied and inclusive your sources and information that you include, though the stronger your result will be. We can see through the varying versions of his plays that Shakespeare made edits and changes as his audiences reacted and responded to them. Shakespeare created three-dimensional characters by considering every aspect of them. Richard III is as charming as he is villainous, winning the audience over to his viewpoint even as he murders his way to the throne. Hamlet, despite his nobility, drives his fiancee to suicide. When you foster inclusivity in your team, every member will feel represented and heard, and the final product will have greater dimension and scope. Just as it takes cooperation and collaboration to make a theatrical production successful, those virtues also ensure a better project or report that represents the knowledge of more than one person. “Myself and other noble friends / Are partners in the business”  – Finding your role in a team Anyone who’s worked in the theatre knows that the sum of a production is greater than its parts. Even an actor playing a huge role like Hamlet is only as good as his (or her ) supporting cast. Each actor learns what is expected of them to make the production a coherent whole. A role like the Second Gravedigger may seem inconsequential on its own, but smart and team-motivated performers know that, without them, a production of Hamlet is like a smile with a missing tooth. Something is missing. When working on any project with others, while the ultimate goal is to complete it, there’s a secondary reward in having been part of a successful team and building new relationships. Be aware, though, that team members who try to take over or overplay their parts will throw off the balance and chemistry of the group. That sort of behavior may earn the resentment of other team members who become overshadowed unfairly. Work on enough successful projects well, and you’ll be noticed for being a great team player — with whom everyone wants to work. As Shakespeare did when writing characters to match the actors he knew could play the roles, gauge the strengths and weaknesses of your teammates and figure out how they mesh with your vision. Work with people you can trust and who’ll follow through. Nobody wants to work with a slacker and pick up their work. Who has time for that? “’tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips” – You’re always collaborating Very often in Shakespeare’s plays, his characters will break into soliloquies. These sometimes-long speeches, usually spoken by an actor alone on stage, tell the audience just what a character is thinking behind his or her actions. Sometimes ( as in Richard III ), the characters fully address the audience to include them in the action. At these moments, Shakespeare fully acknowledges the fact that the people he’s writing about know they’re in a play and being watched by an audience and will collaborate with them. When you write, you always have one “secret” team member collaborating with you that you might forget about: your audience. Who are you writing for? Are they a casual friend? Your boss? A teammate? A sibling? A group? Each of these people has a different viewpoint, perspective, and knowledge, and your writing has to be custom-tailored to fit those requirements. You have to know if your ultimate audience knows nothing or a lot about your topic That final audience should always be in the back of your head, but on some projects, the burden may just be too much for one person to carry, so you can lighten your load by working with others — which will increase the amount of information you can convey. “All’s Well That Ends Well” –  Working as part of a group You’re not Shakespeare, and you (probably) won’t have to adhere to dramatic conventions, so you have the freedom and responsibility to keep your writing coherent and obvious. Don’t make your audience (your boss or team leader) do the unnecessary work of trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together; that’s your job as a team member: to make sure that what you do is a valuable and contributing part of the whole. On the other hand, don’t underplay your part. Like an actor who’s been cast in a play, you’ve been put on a team because you bring your personal expertise to the group, so make sure that what you have to bring to the project is expressed. But don’t overplay your part. Do what you’ve been asked to do to the best of your ability. Hamlet speaks to a troupe of actors about what good acting should be. His words work, though, as a comment about how good writers are those who know their audiences and can target their content without either talking down to them or getting too fancy. When you can find the perfect spot that combines information, expertise, and even entertainment, you become invaluable. In Shakespeare’s words: … let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action.” Dave Sikula is a writer, actor, director and teacher who holds a BA and MS in Theatre and Film History and Criticism.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Pressure Doesn’t Always Create Diamonds: Stress Management in the Workplace", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/stress-management-in-the-workplace/", "abstract": "With workplace stress costing American employers an estimated $200 billion per year in decreased productivity and other stress-related factors, it’s safe to say that the old adage “Pressure creates diamonds” could use some qualifications. While early 20th century psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson discovered that some level of psychological arousal improves performance , we have to understand how stress works psychologically so we can do our best work. Only then can we learn how to work with, rather than against, our biologically-influenced energy rhythms. What is stress? Experts don’t agree on a single definition of “stress,” but the term can be generally understood here as “the psychological perception of pressure, on the one hand, and the body’s response to it, on the other.” In the office, this might mean racing to meet a deadline, and feeling your stomach flip when you wonder if you’ll be able to finish. It could look like wondering whether a passing glance from a team member means something unfavorable, and feeling a rush of fear. We’re all familiar with stress, but its impact might be more pervasive than we consciously acknowledge. Reduce high stress, but stay on your toes Contrary to the common belief that high stress makes us perform better, it actually hinders performance, particularly with challenging tasks. For example, if you’ve ever been under pressure to finish a project and felt stressed to the point of drawing a blank, you’ve experienced high levels of stress impeding your memory. We’re more efficient when we focus our mental energy on one and only one idea at a time. A 2014 study surveying 22,347 employees in 12 countries also found that stress dashes productivity. The research revealed that high stress levels resulted in higher rates of workplace disengagement, absenteeism, and decreased productivity. In other words, high stress dampens our ability to excel at our work. Elevated, prolonged stress also takes a massive toll on our bodies and minds, contributing to conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, anxiety, and depression. Luckily, there’s a lot we can do to alleviate stress and facilitate peak performance. Organize your day for less stress and peak productivity We need to understand how our mental energy works if we want to minimize our own stress. Here are five ways to work with your brain and its functions. Focus on one task at a time. It’s well-established that multitasking is impossible because the mind can only focus on one task at a time. T oggling between tasks burns mental energy . When we get overwhelmed and stressed, we often want to tackle multiple problems at once. Studies show that instead of making us more productive, task switching costs us time. Despite facing a long to-do list or large project, we’re more efficient when we focus our mental energy on one and only one idea at a time. Work in 45-minute blocks Many of us believe that we should be focused all of the time. However, research shows that the human mind can only intently focus for a limited amount of time before we get distracted. Instead of charging ourselves with working straight through to wrap up projects or meet tight deadlines, we can break our work into smaller chunks. This ensures that we’re maximizing productivity and not burning ourselves out by trying to push past our physiological limits. Take 15-minute mind-wandering breaks A wide body of research on “the default mode network,” or the “resting” mind, reveals that mental downtime heightens creativity, aids memory consolidation, and even improves decision-making. Allowing ourselves to daydream in sustained chunks throughout the day helps us recharge, make sense of the day’s work, and keep stamina. Identify your “power hour” Did you know that we all have times of day when we’re most and least productive , influenced by our circadian rhythms? For example, most people reach peak productivity between 9:00 am and 11:00 am, dipping in focus around 2:30 pm. Others are “night owls.” By identifying when we’re most productive, we can schedule our challenging tasks for when we have maximum alertness and brain power. If you’re looking at a packed day at work, and feel stressed about having to get it all done, consider moving the big rocks during your power hour(s). Eat nourishing, energizing foods The food we eat directly influences our mental capabilities . For example, if our blood sugar is low, we’ll have a hard time concentrating. If we eat simple carbohydrates like pasta or sugary treats, we’ll experience an energy and productivity crash . Psychologist Ron Friedman suggests that to maximize productivity, we should make food decisions before we’re hungry, snack throughout the day, and make healthy, high-protein foods just as convenient as unhealthy ones. Work with the tide In attuning ourselves to our brain’s capacities and circadian rhythms, our work days may not feel conventional or span as many hours as before. But by understanding our human rhythms, we become maximally efficient, eliminate excess stress, and potentially get exponentially more productive at whatever matters most to us.", "date": "2017-06-13,"},

I get to see our employees working hard to develop the product and create new partnerships and innovations that promise to make Evernote even better. I also have the privilege of seeing unbelievably inspiring things that people are doing with Evernote. They’re taking it far beyond our original vision of preserving memory. As we look ahead to our 10th anniversary later this year, I marvel at the incredible journey we’re on. And we’re just getting started. What to expect from Evernote in 2018 In the past several months, we made some big strides: we moved to the cloud , updated our iOS app , launched integration partnerships like Slack , and continued our advancements in voice technology . What’s next? You can look forward to several innovations that we’ll release throughout 2018. We’ll make it even easier to put new information in Evernote. You’ll notice that the ways you find and use your information will get better. And it’ll get easier to collaborate within Evernote. In 2018, we’re focusing on three key ideas: Extend We’re extending our product into new areas. We’re focusing on improving Evernote for both individuals and teams. Evernote is about to get a lot more powerful. It’ll still be the Evernote you already know and love, but you’ll be blown away when you see what it can do when you work together. Right now, 70 percent of you use Evernote both at work and at home. You’ve been asking for Evernote to work better when in a group or team setting, and we’re going to deliver that.

Speaking of feedback, I want you to know that we’ve heard you, and you can look forward to seeing even more enhancements to the features you know and love. You’ll also see non-stop improvements to the Evernote experience, especially related to templates—more to come. Explore You’ve told us that it’s important to you to have more ways to capture, use, and find information with Evernote. So we’re looking at ways to improve all three of those areas. For example, we’re expanding Evernote’s speech input capabilities. We’ve already integrated with Siri, and we’re delving into ways to go further. We want it to be as easy as possible to capture any idea in Evernote at the speed of thought, no matter where you are or what you’re doing. We’re also interested in discovering how to help you be more organized without having to do all the organizing yourself. For example, we think you should be able to find what you need without having to search for it. That’s why we’re exploring advanced technologies that’ll allow your notes to be tagged automatically, or placed into the correct notebook without you even touching them. Wouldn’t that be cool? We think that could happen this year. Staying true to our mission As I mentioned at the beginning, people do more than remember things with Evernote. Every day, you tell us some truly astounding stories about new ways that you’re achieving things with Evernote that you couldn’t do without it. It’s humbling to see how our product impacts millions of people’s lives all over the planet. Let me share four of those stories with you. These are stories that make me realize how much Evernote means to people. And they’ve inspired the entire company to help you do even more in 2018: The $2 million search The founder of a start-up that creates virtual reality therapy for people with autism told me about a day a single missing document stood between his company and a grant worth $2 million. On a hunch, and with just minutes to spare before the deadline, he typed a few letters he remembered into the Evernote search bar. The search engine returned the document to him, and he was able to apply, and win the grant. Working together to find a cure A medical company in the US is using our product to help keep the focus on creating effective cancer treatments that help save lives and improve the quality of life for people going through treatment. Evernote is a key ingredient to something that could literally change the world. A new spin on an ancient tradition In Japan, a Buddhist monk from a 450-year old temple in Zenryu-ji traveled to an Evernote community event just to tell me his story. He uses Evernote to make his temple’s meetings better. (Yes, monks are struggling with meetings too!) He captures notes and action items and also uses Evernote to write and edit the temple’s monthly newsletter. Connecting a scattered family A mother of five in Provo, Utah told me that despite the fact that her children live separate lives all around the globe, she stays connected to all of them with Evernote. They share recipes, knitting patterns, and inspirational thoughts as if they were all together in their family home. Evernote’s promise for the future Evernote’s mission is to help individuals and groups to remember everything, turn ideas into action, and work effortlessly together. The innovations you’ll see from us in 2018 do more than simply support that mission. They are also evolving Evernote as it becomes even more essential for the way you interact with technology in your life, work, and the world around you. I’m excited about what’s coming in 2018. And I’m grateful for your support along the way. We think you’ll love it.", "date": "2018-01-31,"},

For more, check out all of our session notes —and look for the “Save to Evernote” button so you can save them forever with a click. How teams and individuals are upending business as usual “I don’t think the Beatles wrote ‘Hey Jude’ in a meeting room with bullet points.” — Torkel Mellingen, VP of Design, Cisco In Collective Tech Experiences & the Future of Teams , Cisco’s VP of Design Torkel Mellingen made some provocative claims, including that ‘meetings are dead’ and that ‘the age of the individual genius is over’. In this new age of teams, Torkel shared a vision for how teams can better work together, exploring how ‘team tech’ differs from personal tech. “We need to come together as teams to create something meaningful.” — Chris O’Neill, CEO, Evernote In B2B and B2C are Dead: Now What? , Evernote CEO Chris O’Neill explored how the Bring Your Own App (BYOA) trend is changing the way we work and how we build products for the workplace, moving beyond B2B (business to business) and B2C (business to consumer) models. He delved into our thinking here at Evernote and proposed a new approach: business to individual to teams. “Your customers aren’t corporations, they are people. Design for them,” Chris observed. Check out the slides and audio recording from Chris’s talk » The brain and the machine: what’s next in AI “The human brain by way of AI and brain computer interfaces (BCI’s) has potentially become something more that it was. It may not be such an easy peaceful and simple transition.” — Jonathon Keats, experimental philosopher In Mental Work: Moving Beyond Our Carbon-Based Minds , Ricardo Chavarriaga, a brain-computer interface (BCI) researcher, and Jonathon Keats, an experimental philosopher, discussed ‘mental work’ and the possibilities that arise from controlling machines with nothing but our thoughts. They explored the potential impacts on art, science, and the workplace. In Sci-Fi to Reality: Evolution of AI in the Workplace , Evernote CTO Anirban Kundu dove into how technologies such as machine learning and AI are evolving, ushering in a new era of workplace productivity. Touching on how we use AI here at Evernote and how it will change the way we work over the next 20 years, he said: “I’m not saying machines are going to replace humans, but could we have a machine that is trained to do it and free up humans for something else?” Afterwards, while reflecting on how much AI was discussed at SXSW, Anirban observed that the next steps will be to figure out “how we can shape the world of tomorrow while not being fueled by the biases and polarization of today”. Check out the slides and audio recording from Anirban’s talk » Why timing is everything “The hidden pattern within our days profoundly affects our mood and performance.” — Daniel Pink, bestselling author In The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing , bestselling author Daniel Pink showed how timing is not an art, but a science. It turns out that when we do things matters. Daniel gave advice on when to drink coffee, when to workout, and even covered the science behind the perfect nap. How to build a better workplace, for all This past year, gender, diversity, and inclusion have been top of mind, so these topics unsurprisingly cropped up in many SXSW panels and discussions. From The Post 50/50 Workforce to The Truth about Diversity in Tech , there were numerous sessions with real, vulnerable conversations around how we can build a workplace that works for everybody. Here were some highlights: “We need you at the table, we want you at the table, and we have made room for you at the table.” — Author Dr. Patti Fletcher’s message for men In DISRUPTERS: Gender Equality for 2018 , tech executive, board member, and angel investor Dr. Patti Fletcher shared successful strategies for challenging the status quo. She discussed combating unconscious bias, how men and women can work together, and how the ‘Disrupter’ approach differs from ‘Lean In’. “If you have an opportunity to be in a position to fix it, then absolutely, I want a firm seat at the table, in my sequins.” — Bozoma Saint John on joining Uber Claiming a seat at the table was a key theme this year. In Break & Re-Make Your Brand with Uber , Bozoma Saint John (Uber’s first ever Chief Brand Officer) discussed the power of brand and the turnaround underway at the ride-sharing company—but she didn’t shy away from talking about what needs to change in order to build more inclusive and diverse workforces in tech. “Companies that have diversity and inclusion departments are companies that want to last for another 100 years…The goal of the diversity and inclusion team isn’t to make everyone feel good—it’s to increase price per share.” — Eileen Carey, Founder & CEO, Glassbreakers From strategies on making technology work for everyone to the specifics of how to create a diverse pipeline, the panelists of Inclusion + Tech: How To Get It Right discussed how diversity and inclusion is a competitive advantage for companies. How companies can listen “As a company, don’t be afraid to listen to your employees. You hire amazing talent for a reason and it would be a shame not to listen to their ideas.” — Stephen Huerta, Co-founder & CEO, Workify In Power to the People: Turn Employee Ideas Into Gold , a panel discussed how companies miss out on ‘employee gold,’ or the great ideas that come from within.

With the latest release of Evernote for Windows (v6.5 and v6.6) and Mac (v6.12), you’ll notice that tables now have a whole new look—and they’re more intuitive and flexible than ever. Even if you wouldn’t exactly call yourself a fan of tables, once you start using them to track projects, organize information, and break down complex ideas you’re presenting to others, you may find our newly designed tables hard to resist. Table editing made simpler Sometimes, it’s hard to know just how many rows or columns you’ll end up needing. No worries—now, you can easily add as you go. Create a new row or column anywhere you’d like, with just one click. Not sure where you want a row or column to go? Drag rows and columns around in a table until it’s just the way you want it. You can also merge cells now. Cell merging is one of our most requested table features, so we made it a top priority. Geek out by grouping adjacent table cells together, adding more layers of organization to your tables. Clarify with color Adding background colors to your tables is easier than ever. Select one or more cells, columns, or rows (anywhere in a table), then pick a color.  It’s that easy. All the columns you need Running out of space? No worries. The new tables are horizontally scrollable, which means you can make tables as wide as you want them to be, without worrying about columns getting squeezed together. Go ahead and add all the columns you need. See the big picture We all love that Evernote lets you add photos, screenshots, or scans to a note. But, scrolling up and down to see all the images you’ve added can be a chore. Evernote’s new image gallery lets you browse through all the images without distractions. Simply double-click on an image to launch the viewer, then sit back, and enjoy watching them glide elegantly across the screen.

Never before have so many devices, cell phone alerts, social media platforms, advertisers, and tasks been competing for our attention. So, we could all probably use a little help getting focused. After all, focusing in the right way on the right things at the right times is a critical life success skill – one that psychologists have discovered we can improve with practice. First, what is focus? According to Daniel Goleman, a leading psychologist and expert in attention science, and author of Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence , there are different types of focus. “There are many varieties of attention, technically speaking, each with their best applications,” he explained to Forbes . “Getting a job done well requires applying concentration, for instance, while creative insights flow best when we are in a loose, open awareness.” In other words, while focus involves how we’re casting our attention (we’re always focusing on something! ), different modes of attention exist and are best used for different tasks. Goleman casts the types of attention – which neuroscientists study through fMRI or functional magnetic resonance imaging – into three general categories. He argues that we can have “inner,” “outer,” or “other” focus, or focus on the self, other people, and the world around us. The most successful of us develop and balance out this “triad of awareness,” because “a failure to focus inward leaves you rudderless, a failure to focus on others renders you clueless, and a failure to focus outward may leave you blindsided.” Inner focus involves developing self-awareness, or listening to our inner voice. Self-control, or willpower, involves placing our attention on a given task and keeping it there. This second skill, which we also think of as concentration, is what many of us think of when we say we want to focus better. It’s what we’ll be focusing on – pun intended – in this article. But how do we successfully use our willpower? Goleman says there are three ways. Voluntarily disengage our focus from what’s distracting us Work toward resisting distraction so that we don’t gravitate back to it Concentrate on what we’re supposed to be doing and imagine how good we will feel when we achieve it When we’re practicing concentration, it’s important to practice these three habits. Other awareness involves focusing on others and how we relate to the people around us. It requires developing our empathy and understanding how other people are feeling. Outer awareness refers to focus on the world around us: political, cultural, and economic dynamics, to name a few. According to Goleman, understanding the world is critical for being strategic and innovative. How attention and concentration work What’s happening on a brain activity level when we’re concentrated versus distracted? To answer this question, it’s important to understand the two “systems” that psychologists like Daniel Kahneman say govern the brain. Kahneman, a Nobel Memorial Prize winner, calls these System 1 and System 2 , the automatic and reflective systems respectively. System 1, or the automatic system, is our involuntary brain network that’s always scanning our environments and processing stimuli. It’s the system that causes us to automatically jump when someone touches our shoulders unexpectedly, or step closer to the sidewalk when a car comes careening by. It makes fast decisions and is always humming in the background. When we’re trying to focus, environmental stimuli – including something as insignificant as a co-worker pulling a door closed – can serve as distractions. System 2, or the reflective system, is voluntary and we use it to make rational, deliberate, analytically-based decisions. It’s the system we use when we sit at our desks and plan projects, strategize, and otherwise analyze our work and lives. Engaging System 2 requires willpower to get the job done. While our willpower muscle can be strengthened with practice, it also gets fatigued. That means we can’t rely on concentrating for indefinite periods of time. Also, when we’re concentrating, our brains are expending energy to suppress distractions . Concentrating comes at a metabolic cost – when our brains get tired, we’re less productive and sharp. It takes longer to complete tasks and we’re more susceptible to making errors in our work. How to avoid distraction traps So, how do we improve the duration and stamina of our concentration? Here are four tips to help you out. Minimize all distractions that you have control over. Eliminate any extra noises, alerts, and computer tabs from your workspace. This includes phone alarms, text alerts, and your inbox. We want to reduce the amount of external stimuli that System 1, the automatic response system, reports to System 2 (resulting in distraction). The less often our external environment demands our attention, the better we’re able to sustain concentration. Practice training your “focus muscle.” Goleman shares , “The ability to focus is like a mental muscle. The more we work it out, the stronger it [becomes].” How do we practice focusing? He offers a research-based , four part practice – originally discovered by Emory University professor Wendy Hasenkamp – for doing mental focus “reps”: Focus on your breath Recognize that your thoughts have drifted off Let go of your current thought Focus on your breath again and stay there That four-step process is “one rep.” Each time you lose focus, you practice that rep. Goleman explains that this simple but challenging practice strengthens the brain’s circuitry. You can also practice focusing for progressively longer bouts of time. For example, you can start by focusing intently for ten minutes at a time and build up from there. Remember: we can practice being more focused and get more proficient over time. We get better emotional regulation and less stress, both factors that translate to better focus. Meditate. Studies suggest that meditating regularly reduces mind-wandering and increases our ability to maintain concentration over extended periods of time. A review of 23 different meditation studies found that people who practiced for a few months improved their ability to suppress environmental stimuli, which is critical for maintaining attention. And, another review of 30 different studies on mindfulness and meditation showed that just eight weeks of mindfulness-based stress reduction produces results in the brain similar to that of a long-term meditation practice. Try meditating for five minutes a day to start. If you want to learn specific techniques for meditation, take an in-person class or use an app like Headspace. If possible, put your phone in a different room. We all know that receiving a text or email can cause a distraction. But a recent study from the University of Texas at Austin suggests that having our cell phones within reach – even if they’re powered off – reduces cognitive capacity, or ability to concentrate. In the nearly 800-person study, researchers asked participants to perform tests that required concentration. The results? The participants who left their phones outside the room outperformed those with phones on their desks and in their bags, by a large and slight margin respectively. Professor Austin Ward, who helped lead the study, explained : “Your conscious mind isn’t thinking about your smartphone, but [the process of requiring yourself to not think about something] uses up some of your limited cognitive resources.” Next time you sit down to make headway on work, try leaving your phone out of sight and notice what changes. Better self-control equals… Developing self-control sure takes effort, but data shows the payoff is likely worth the work. The Dunedin Study , a multi-decade long longitudinal study, tracked over 1,000 people as children then assessed their health and wealth outcomes, as well as their criminal histories, as adults. The study revealed a strong link between degrees of self-control and success in those areas, and that self-control can be learned. Although the relationships between these two related findings may not necessarily be causal, it’s powerful to know that with incremental changes, we can very likely heighten our physical and financial well-being.", "date": "2017-08-8,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Connect the Notes: Use Note Links to Get Around Faster", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/use-note-links-to-get-around-faster/", "abstract": "When you first get started in Evernote, you can probably get to what you need quickly. But as you start to add more notes, you may find that you don’t get around as fast as you used to. Scrolling, navigating, and searching—it all starts to take a little bit longer. Thankfully, there’s a highly underrated feature that is here to help: note links. A note link is exactly what it sounds like: a link that takes you from one note to another within Evernote. While this might not seem to be much of a game changer, this seemingly simple feature is actually a secret weapon to create structure and zoom around your notes. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know about note links, from why they matter to how they work, and we’ll give you some ideas for using them. If you haven’t thought much of note links in the past (or even heard of them), it’s time to take a closer look. Already a note links expert? Head straight to the good stuff—check out our public notebook that’s filled with ideas and examples of how to use them. A trail of breadcrumbs You know when you go to look something up on Wikipedia and then hours later you suddenly find yourself reading everything there is to know about Amelia Earhart’s mysterious disappearance? This knowledge spree is enabled by the links to other entries. You jump from page to page through a web of well-connected hyperlinks and it’s so effortless you don’t even realize it’s happening. Note links in Evernote can function in the same way—minus the rabbit holes filled with distractions, of course. Connecting multiple notes to each other creates relationships between them. In a way, you’re building a trail of breadcrumbs that acts as a digital path to your most used notes. You can match your tasks to the information you need to get them done, or bind your deliverables with all of the research that went into them. But enough about how great they are—now onto how they work. Note Links 101 To create a link to a note on Mac or Windows, simply right-click the note in your list and choose ‘Copy Note Link’. The link to your note is now on your clipboard, standing at the ready—all you have to decide is where to put it. Paste this note link into an existing note, or create a new one. And there you have it. The name of the note you just grabbed the link to is now pasted as a green hyperlink, just waiting to be clicked on. Use note links to connect and organize multiple notes on a similar topic. https://t.co/AvXAfDUPjH #EvernoteTips pic.twitter.com/IbletLlYMf — Evernote (@evernote) August 8, 2017 Pro tip: If you’re an iPhone or iPad user, you can also easily create note links on the go. Simply tap the ‘share’ button (box with upward arrow), tap ‘Copy link,’ then, chose ‘Private link’. It works on web as well. Click the options button (three dots) at the top of the note, then click ‘Copy note link’. Learn more about creating note links. » Note Links 201: advanced tips So now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s dig a little deeper. Shortcuts for links Shortcuts can make note-linking a lot easier. Click on a note and use Control + Option + Command + C on Mac or Ctrl + Alt + L on Windows to copy a note link. A slightly more well-known shortcut, (Command + V or Ctrl + V), lets you paste your note link wherever you desire. Now you can link notes using just your keyboard. What’s in a name? When you drop a note link in Evernote, the title of that note turns into the hyperlink. So if you copy a link to a note entitled ‘Meeting Agenda,’ then the green hyperlink to this note will simply read ‘Meeting Agenda’ when you paste it. Note naming standards can help make things more clear. You could use more descriptive note titles, such as ‘Weekly Mobile Product Meeting Agenda’ instead of just ‘Meeting Agenda’. But you can also edit the text of the hyperlink using a different approach. Copy the note link, but instead of pasting it, highlight the text in your new note that you want to add the note link to and use Command + K on Mac and Control + K on Windows. These shortcuts let you add hyperlinks in a flash. That way, the note link reads how you want it to (without changing the note title). A batch of links, coming right up You can also create multiple note links in one go. Select a few notes at a time, and then right-click and select ‘Copy Note Link’. When you paste, a link to each note will be created. And the notes don’t even have to be in order. If you want to grab links to notes that aren’t next to each other, use Command+click on Mac or Control+click on Windows. Jumping vs. sharing: the difference between note links and public links A friendly public service announcement: note links are different from public links . Public links are note URLs that you can share with others even if they don’t have an Evernote account. They will open in Evernote Web, giving anyone access to the note, even if they don’t have an Evernote account. With note links, you need to have permission to view the note. Note links are intended to help you jump to specific notes, whether you’re inside or outside of Evernote. Think of them more as an organizational tool for those with a need for speed, rather than a way to share far and wide with others. Learn more about sharing notes with others. No broken links around here Nothing ruins a good workflow like a broken link. Fortunately, even if you rename a note or move it to another notebook, your note link will still get you there safely. The only thing that can break a note link is the almighty Evernote trash can, so be sure to take care when deleting notes. Table your contents The most quintessential way to use note links is as a table of contents. You can do this manually by creating a new note, titling it ‘Table of Contents’, copying the note links to all of the notes you want to include, and pasting them into your new Table of Contents note. This works especially well if you want to include notes in different notebooks. But there’s an advanced hack as well. When using Evernote for Mac or Windows, hold down Command + click or Control + click to select all of the notes you’d like to include. Then select ‘Create Table of Contents Note’. This will automatically make a new note appear, already titled ‘Table of Contents’ and with a list of links for each note. You could make a table of contents for every notebook, so you could quickly get to all of the notes in it. You could also create a table of contents for a particular project or the book you are writing in Evernote . The possibilities are endless. Pro tip: A table of contents doesn’t automatically update when you add a new note to a notebook, so don’t forget to add a note link for every new note you create if you want it to be included. Learn more about creating a table of contents. Ideas and inspiration: note links in action So now that you know all the ins and outs of note links, you’re ready to start using them. But how? From preparing for meetings to keeping a journal to organizing your class notes, note links can make just about anything faster. We’ve pulled together some examples to get you started in a public notebook for you to peruse as you please.

Peanut butter and jelly. Time and tide. Abbott and Costello. Web Clipper and Evernote. Adding the Web Clipper extension to your browser makes Evernote a more powerful and essential part of your day. Here’s why: 1) So quick, it’s kinda like cheating – If I think an article or piece of inspiration will come in handy one day, Web Clipper lets me make it mine. I don’t need to wonder if I emailed it to myself or saved it to my bookmarks because I know it’s in Evernote. 2) You can’t bookmark everything – So they’ve figured out how to sync bookmarks to mobile browsers, but whether you’re on your phone or on your laptop, navigating through the folder tree of all the things you’ve saved is still messy. And it can feel like you only have room for the really important stuff—bookmarking every good GIF I’ve found would probably break my browser. With Web Clipper, you can save it all, and easily organize and find your clips later on any device. 3) Sometimes you need to share – I don’t even like cats, but my friend sure would love this listicle of cat GIFs I just found. Bam. Sent. Right from Web Clipper. Sharing clips with friends is as easy as saving them for yourself. 4) It’s permanent and it’s yours – Even the best content rots on the internet. With Web Clipper, you save the page or section you want as a note, instead of just grabbing the link. So you won’t have to deal with those pesky 404 pages and broken links anymore. 5) It keeps me on point – Sometimes I save things only to forget why it caught my eye in the first place. It’s kind of like going into a room and forgetting why you walked in there. But with Web Clipper, I highlight and annotate important sections so that I can easily flag the bits I wanted to revisit. 6) Goodbye, copy + paste – Before I got Web Clipper, I would copy and paste paragraphs I liked or entire articles I wanted to save into a new note in Evernote. But all the highlighting, pasting, and switching between apps (or toggling between browser tabs) takes up unnecessary time. With Web Clipper, I never need to copy and paste from the web. 7) It cleans pages up – Web Clipper strips out the ads and social tools, leaving me with just the content I want. This works especially well when clipping from Gmail, Amazon, YouTube, and LinkedIn. 8) It’s smart – Web Clipper learns on the go, figuring out over time which notebook I want to save specific pages to. For example, it suggests sending blog posts to my ‘Read Later’ notebook and travel confirmations to ‘Travel’. 9) It makes Google better – By turning on the related results setting in Web Clipper options, my own personal Evernote results privately show up alongside Google searches. It’s a good reminder of what I’ve clipped and how it relates to my search. 10) I can clip on mobile – You can even save web pages on iOS and Android devices. With this feature, I can clip where I do my most meaningful browsing: the bathroom. I mean… mobile. Yeah, mobile. I use a lot of great extensions, but If I were to use only one, it’d be Web Clipper. I’d go so far as to say that if someone is using Evernote but not Web Clipper, they’re not even really using Evernote yet. Get it, fall in love with it, and thank me later.

Make it Happen in 2018", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/starting-a-business-in-2018/", "abstract": "You’ve got a secret. You may have a great job, and you’re good at it, too. But deep down, you want to start a business of your own. You have a hobby you want to turn into a side hustle or an idea you want to grow into a product. You’ve spent some time gathering inspiration, collecting tips, and thinking about ‘someday maybe.’ Yet you haven’t made the leap. Fear, not knowing where to start, feeling disorganized—there’s definitely no shortage of things holding you back. But 2018 is the year you can make it happen. In fact, you’re further along than you think. We’ll show you why, and give you tips for using Evernote to find everything you need to transform your business idea into reality. What’s holding you back A survey showed that about a third of Americans find the idea of starting their own company scarier than skydiving. And this fear holds them back. While 57 percent of Americans have had at least one new product or business idea, the survey found that only about two in five took steps to make it happen. It’s not hard to understand why. There are estimates that anywhere from 50 to 80 percent of small businesses fail in their first year. But what else is driving this fear? Maybe you don’t feel organized enough or experienced enough. Perhaps you say things to yourself like, “Once I have the time, I’ll make it happen.” Or maybe you have more specific concerns, such as “I don’t have any expertise in selling.” Either way, it’s a huge project to take on, and it could easily feel like you’re starting from square one. Why making it happen is easier than you think But here’s the thing: you’re further along than you think. Here’s why: You’ve taken the first step . Coming up with a goal or a dream is often the hardest part. Remember, only 57 percent of Americans come up with one business or product idea. You’re one of the lucky ones that have an entrepreneurial mindset. You’ve gathered inspiration. Think about all that time you’ve spent dreaming about starting a business. How many articles have you clipped that offer ‘entrepreneur hacks’ or tips for creating a business plan? How many websites have you saved for the cool design ideas? Look through your notes, and you’ll probably find that you’ve already done a lot of homework. You aren’t starting from nothing. You’ve got the tool you need. You’ve been saving everything in Evernote. The building blocks of your business idea may be scattered across random notes, or all piled into your ‘Read Later’ notebook, but they’re in there. You just need to organize and make sense of them. Then, you can easily build on what you’ve done—day by day. It can be something small, like researching how to get a prototype made, or looking into how incorporation works. Breaking your work into smaller, more achievable tasks will give you the momentum you need. So with this in mind, it’s time to get to work. Here are six ways you can use Evernote to make your dream of starting a business happen in 2018: 1. Search through what you already have. You already have everything you need to get started; you just need to see it all so you can feel more organized. This is where Evernote’s powerful little search bar comes in. Whether it’s dozens (okay, hundreds) of clipped articles, saved websites, highlighted PDFs, Post-Its, or whiteboard sketches that you’ve collected over weeks, months, or even years, you can use Evernote’s search tool to round things up. Easily find it all by searching for terms related to your business idea, or starting a business. No matter whether it was a clipped article or a handwritten note, you’ll be able to find it. With Evernote Premium, you can even search inside PDFs. If you have saved A LOT of things, no worries. Check out these five tips for organizing Evernote to find what you need quickly. 2. Tag it up. As you go through your search results, add tags to help make sense of what you have. If you’ve got an article you emailed yourself with advice on how to incorporate, tag it with ‘entrepreneur tips.’ If you’ve got a clipped website design that you really liked, tag it with ‘inspiration.’ Adding these keywords to notes makes them easier to revisit, especially if you’ve got a lot of them. Get more tips for organizing with tags. » 3. Set up a dedicated notebook. Create a notebook specifically for your business idea and add it to your shortcuts so you can always access it quickly. If you have something new to add, you can easily clip a webpage or save an email and send it straight to your notebook. 4. Create a project plan. Now’s the time to figure out the nuts and bolts. Use tables or checklists to organize your tasks. Try our new 2018 planning templates to organize your time. » 5. Set reminders. You can use reminders to stay on track with your project plan or to remember to come back to an idea when you have more time. That way, you can hold yourself accountable and ensure inspiration doesn’t go to waste. Learn more about setting up reminders. » 6. Work offline. When you’re working on the side, you have to find the time wherever you can. It may be on your commute, it may be while you’re on a flight, or it may be jotting down an idea while you’re at the store. The good news is that you can always access your ideas with Evernote Premium, thanks to offline notebooks. Learn how to set up offline notebooks. » And BOOM!

The most important thing to remember is to keep your notes consistent, regardless of the method that you use. Format your notes the same way across all your classes, with the class name, date, and topic at the top of each one. Use templates If you’re looking for a way to get started fast, using ready-made templates for your notes can help you become more productive right away, without spending a lot of time worrying about formatting. We’ve assembled some professionally designed note-taking templates that you can grab right here: Get Evernote templates for students » Dorothy recommends collecting all your favorite templates together in one notebook. “Just open the template, copy it to the notebook you keep for each class, and it’s there and ready to go,” she says. “All you have to do is fill out the information.” Tie up loose papers with scanning Taking notes by hand? Got a lot of paper handouts to deal with? You can still use Evernote to save and search them. “Scanning is your best friend for handwritten notes,” Dorothy says. Here’s how it works: Open the Evernote app on your phone Choose the “+” icon Select the camera icon Evernote will auto-detect your paper and will scan it to any notebook you want. Evernote can find text in those images, even handwriting, so you don’t have to flip through your notebook looking for a specific name or date when you study your notes later. “Searching handwriting, to me it’s like magic,” Dorothy says. “Just search and it will find the note, the location of the note, and it’ll highlight the location for you.” Pro tip: Scanning with the camera in Evernote is a great way to capture things drawn on dry-erase boards too. Put it in Evernote before your professor erases it! Clip from the web Over the course of the school year, you’ll undoubtedly do two things: find source material on the web, and cite it in your annotated bibliographies. Evernote can help with that, too. Add the Evernote Web Clipper extension to your favorite browser and you can save useful articles or web pages directly to your class notebooks. “You can choose to clip a full article, or a simplified article which just gives you the meat without the surrounding ads and other stuff,” Dorothy said. “Or, you can use my favorite, which is clip selection, which lets you clip and save only the part of a website you want to keep.” The URL of the web page is saved, too. You’ll need that if you want to cite the article or go back for more. Keep emails with your notes Did you know that your Evernote account comes with its own email address? “That’s there just so you can forward things from your email account into Evernote so that they don’t get lost in your inbox.” Find your Evernote email in your account settings, and then save it as a contact. Now, when you get an email that you want to save (such as reminders about tuition payments and messages from your teachers) just forward it to the notebook of your choice. You can even set a reminder so Evernote will let you know when it’s time to deal with it. Organize your own way Some people prefer to organize their notes like a virtual file cabinet. “You might have one notebook per class, or perhaps you have a notebook stack, which you think of as a group of notebooks stuck together, on different topics in the same class,” Dorothy says. “But if that feels overwhelming, or if you just want to ‘brain dump’ information, tags are your best friend.” Like hashtags in social media, tags in Evernote let you find related notes regardless of what notebooks they’re in. Dorothy suggests using two tags for a particular note: one for the class, and the other for the subject matter. “If even that feels like too much, just rely on search. As long as all your stuff is in one place, you’re fine. You can use any computer or device, and you’ll find what you need.” Be sure to check out the full list of resources mentioned in this video (and save it to Evernote for future reference).

To hear the rest, click on the player above or look for us on iTunes , SoundCloud , Overcast , or your podcast platform of choice. You’ve had a fascinating, varied career, and it doesn’t follow the standard narrative. What are your core interests? What is it that drives you personally? I think when I look back on all my career decisions, I’ve been primarily motivated by growth and learning. Basically, if I feel like my learning is plateauing, then it’s sort of time to do something different. That’s what’s driven me at all the major pivots in my career. After [four years at Google], you wound up doing product management at Polyvore, which is a very interesting company. Polyvore is a fashion community app, where basically you can mix and match all your favorite products in different stores into outfits or collages, and then millions of people come every month to browse and shop those looks. When I first discovered Polyvore, it was just the outfit creation tool, and it was kind of like online Photoshop, but with shopping integrated, and it was super fun to play with. So I started playing with it all the time. I was using it maybe three or four hours a night, as a very addicted user. Then I wrote a note to the co-founders with a series of complaints and suggestions for how to make the product better. They wrote back and said, “Hey, why don’t you just work on this stuff yourself? Why don’t you just come join us?” I ended up joining as the first PM, and that eventually grew into a co-founder role, strangely in reverse, and then eventually the CEO role. But part of the reason I went there was definitely because I felt like I would learn a lot, ’cause there were only three other people at the time. Were there any specific things that happened at Polyvore which affected the way you view leadership? I had never managed a single person before arriving at Polyvore. So I kind of had to learn it from scratch, on the job, through a lot of trial and error. You can read a lot about management best practices, but there’s no replacement for actually doing it. “You can read a lot about managing best practices, but there’s no replacement for actually doing it.” I think one of the biggest lessons for me was how to lead authentically. I tried for a while to copy different leadership styles that I had seen, especially very classic, extroverted leadership styles, which you see in the movies. Sort of like the War General. It took me a while to figure out my style, because I’m more of an introvert. I was an inexperienced first-time CEO, so I couldn’t say with much authority, “I know exactly where we’re going,” exactly what we needed to do. I figured out eventually that, at the end of the day, you need your team to trust you, and to feel like they have a purpose and a mission. There’s an art to cultivating that, and I realized that rather than pretending that I knew everything all of the time, it’s actually better to just sort of point the ship in a general direction, say, “This is the destination I would like us to get to. It’s going to be bumpy along the way, and I need you, I need your help to get there.” I was really inspired by Cheryl Dalrymple, who is the CFO that I eventually hired at Polyvore. When I first met her, I just remember being really blown away. She’s now the CFO at Confluent. She taught me that you can be a leader while still being very warm, and very authentic, a little quirky. People would follow her to the ends of the earth, and that’s something I took a lot of inspiration from. After I met her and realized she had this quality, and I could learn a ton from her, I bent over backwards to just try to hire her, to try to get her to be an executive at Polyvore so that I could learn as much as possible from her. That’s maybe another lesson, surround yourself with awesome people who you admire. What are you most proud of, from your time at Polyvore? I’m proud that we built a company that was profitable for three years. I’m proud of the impact we had on some of the users who would write in to say things like, “You gave me more confidence in life, because I figured out a style that worked for me. I felt better.” We even had one girl write in to say that she was inspired to study Computer Science by Polyvore. That was her admissions essay into Cornell, was about Polyvore. And that was a really proud moment. I was really proud when we won “Great Places to Work.” We won in 2014, overall, for tech. And then in 2015, for best workplace for diversity and women. I’m proud of the culture and the team that we built. You’ve moved from there into a new role in venture capital. What drove that move? Part of it was definitely, again, maximizing for learning and growth. Investing is not something I’ve done before, and that’s the best way to learn, is to do something you haven’t done before. On top of that I thought, “How do I leverage the eight and a half years of lessons from Polyvore, through all the epic highs and epic lows, the ups and downs?” Some of those lessons were really painful. “How do I leverage that, and make a big impact?” I thought if I could help the next generation of entrepreneurs and founders, and help them maybe shave off a day here, not make a mistake that I made, or just advise a little bit, and then spread out that help across the portfolio companies, that I would feel great about that. Also, there aren’t a lot of women in venture, and I think that ends up impacting the number of women who get funded. That impacts women executives, and then eventually, the percentage of women in engineering. It all trickles down and I thought, maybe I can make an impact there, as well. Working with Sequoia, I’m sure you’re seeing a lot of very interesting pitches coming your way, you’re involved with a lot of interesting companies. What areas of innovation are particularly exciting to you right now? There are so many. I have been spending most of my time in consumer, but that doesn’t just mean consumer, internet and mobile. I’ve also started to look a little bit at consumer use cases in robotics, in direct-to-consumer brands, in AR and VR … there’s a lot going on. That’s been exciting. I feel like I’m seeing a big trend towards tech moving out of your devices and into the real world, whether that’s home automation, or tech-enabled commerce, or tech impacting the way we work on a day-to-day basis. I think that’s one of the more interesting trends. I’m seeing a lot of activity, and I expect to see a lot more. What do you think are the biggest roadblocks to innovation within companies today? I think companies can get addicted to their own success, and then start to fear jeopardizing it, or feel like if they step away from that core business, that something might go wrong. So I think the best way to get around that is to dedicate an entire team whose job is to just think about what’s new. You kind of want to create a little bit of separation. We did a little bit of this after Polyvore was acquired by Yahoo. We took a portion of the Polyvore team, and got them staffed to just work on completely brand-new ideas in the lifestyle space. While we were there, we actually shipped maybe five or six prototypes of apps that we were able to brainstorm and build in, I think around seven weeks turnaround time, from inception and brainstorming to putting them in the App Store. We were able to test quite a few ideas. One of which eventually turned into Cabana, by Tumblr, which is a live streaming app that the Polyvore team worked on. It sounds like a good approach to fighting that fear of change that can become ingrained in a large company. There’s also, I think in a large company, that problem of, once something’s that large, it’s hard to turn the ship. Is there a way to fight that sort of inertia? I think part of it also comes from setting the tone of the culture at the very top. Companies that are able to reinvent and reinvigorate are the ones that are a little bit paranoid and have a really, really high bar. If you know from the get-go that you’re a consumer company… it depends on the product, exactly, but for some consumer-use cases, like social communication, a lot of that is driven not just by the utility or the functionality of the product, but also by how cool it is. “Companies that are able to reinvent are the ones that are a little bit paranoid and have a really, really high bar.” So, if you accept that you’re on this treadmill of cool, which is definitely the case for some hardware, some communication apps. I think Apple gets that. I think Snapchat gets that. So they hold the bar very high, and even though they’re doing well, they still feel this urge to reinvent and raise the bar higher and come up with the next thing, or the next feature. I think that’s baked into cultures, at the very highest levels. When we’re talking about little companies, startups or individual entrepreneurs … of course, the fact that they can pursue the cool is their advantage, but it can also be a downfall. Maybe it’s hard to know when an idea is worth pursuing. When do you think is the right time to jump on an idea? You know it’s good when people start to tell each other about it. You find this kernel of delight. And delight isn’t just, “Yes, this was useful.” It was a moment of, “Wow, that was cool.” And then the notion that you might want to tell someone else about it. That’s what leads to word-of-mouth, that’s what leads to growth, and that’s how you know that something is worth pursuing. What would your advice be for someone who’s maybe thinking of starting their first company? Build something useful and delightful, might be the first one. Second, just understand that great companies take, usually, a while to grow. There’s no real overnight success. Polyvore was an eight-and-a-half year journey, and I think our acquisition by Yahoo was seven and a half years in. But the average exit time for a successful startup is eight years. So, pick an idea and a co-founder that you’d be excited to be married to for at least eight years. That would be my advice. I want to dig a little deeper into some of the issues of leadership and culture that you brought up earlier. In particular, you mentioned that one of the things that inspires you in your role now as a VC is the opportunity to help more women get involved in engineering, in company-building, in all of those fields. This is a part of the world that still, I think, has a very male-dominated culture. There are lots of women working [in the field], but it seems like almost every month, there’s another story about how it’s still difficult for women to make an impact in the world of tech and get ahead. Why is this still a problem? Part of it, I think, is the ratio. But part of it has been, up till now, kind of a lack of recognition that it is a problem. I think what’s the good part of all the news that’s come to light lately is, people were talking about it now. And also, it reflects a change in the norms, in that when someone comes forward, it’s no longer the norm that her career is destroyed … I think that was more the norm, before. So just the shift that’s been happening over the last few months represents a change. […] I think now that the news is starting to come out, people are realizing, “Oh wow, this was happening all along. This is happening in my organization, I’ve just been unconscious of it the entire time.” But now that that recognition is happening, that’s when change can begin. This intersects with other areas of culture, and we’ve had some prominent examples where culture can just go toxic. When that happens, it doesn’t just necessarily affect the company itself. It can also affect the economy at large. I think about some of the more prominent cases lately of toxic culture, and these are sometimes some very large companies that are very disruptive in their space, and that are considered real trendsetters. If they can’t get it together, what does that mean for tech as a whole? Startups go through all kinds of ups and downs, and culture can be your lifesaver when you’re in the downs. When you’re no longer winning, and crushing it, and going “up and to the right,” and there are issues, people flee your company. They will flee if your culture is bad, because that was part of what was making them unhappy all along. But they’re willing to put up with it to be part of a winning team. And as soon as you’re no longer winning, they leave. I think culture is something you entirely control, as a founder within your company. You are the person who sets the example, you hire the people. It’s something entirely within your control, unlike economy or the market or competitors, which are all risks to your startup. So there’s really no excuse for getting it right, because you entirely control it. And the benefit of getting it right is whenever you hit a bump in the road, your team is much more likely to be loyal, and to believe, and to want to stick around to fight the battle, if they love the culture and they love the team. So, culture is something you should absolutely invest in, unless you plan to be winning 100% of the time, which is impossible, as has been shown by all the latest news. It’s just not possible to win all the time. How does culture impact innovation and creativity, and how did you foster innovation and creativity when you were at Polyvore? At Polyvore, our three core values were, “Delight the user,” “Do a few things well,” and, “Make an impact.” For every new person who joined the company, day one on orientation, I would walk them through … probably the first meeting of the day, after they signed their papers, was to meet with me and I would walk them through those three values and what they meant with quite a lot of detail into the examples. The bulk of orientation was culture, and then part of it after, we went into the product and the strategy and the users. But I felt like hearing from me as the CEO what the culture meant, and how to live it, was actually a really strong indicator that the culture’s really important. It was also an opportunity to ask questions about it, and to understand it. That’s part of how I tried to make sure the culture permeated through the company. In terms of innovation, “Delight the user,” going back to that one, the first value, I would explain kind of what I talked about earlier. How you have to constantly raise the bar, and not just build a functional product, but a functional and delightful product. You would constantly have to top yourself. I would give examples. I used Apple as an example of how people think they want a better, faster horse, but really what they want is a car. And they’re not going to tell you, if they’ve only ever seen a horse, that they need a car. So you have to come up with it. And then, even when you build that car and people are really happy with it, then you have to come up with the rocket, a spaceship, whatever’s next. It sounds like the concept of being functional and delightful applies externally, in terms of the product you build, but also applies internally, in terms of the culture you build. Absolutely. How about now that you’re on the VC side? What do you look for in a healthy company? I think there are some classic things that pretty much all VC’s look for, like a very large market, a founding team that’s capable. For me, personally, a few additional things that I look for are grit… because, like I said, it takes a really long time to build a great company, and you want someone who can weather the storms, who can go through the ups and downs. So, I look for grit. Another trait I find quite useful is the ability to take something complex, and explain it simply. That applies to so many things. It’s your elevator pitch when you’re talking to investors, it becomes important. Your ability to communicate to your team, and even more important than that though, to be able to run an all-hands and explain to your team where you’re going and how you’re going to get there. All of that is really, really important. So, I look for the ability to explain complex things simply. Is there one particular skill that you wish every businessperson would learn? Maybe empathy. The ability to understand something from someone else’s perspective. Whether that’s a coworker or an employee, or even your customers, that’s a pretty useful skill. We’ve talked a lot about culture and working effectively as a team. How about working effectively as an individual? How do you manage your very busy time? I take a lot of notes on everything, to be honest. They may not always be the most organized of notes, but I do find it’s important to capture the information. I can always go back later and make sense of it, but it’s helpful to have it there so that I can even try to retrieve it in the first place. I take a lot of notes on everything, to be honest. They may not always be the most organized of notes, but I do find it’s important to capture the information. I do it both on my computer and Evernote, as well as… since I love to draw, I always have a small sketchbook with me, and a pen. So, I’ll take notes on paper as well. And then I take photos of it using Evernote’s capture feature, and then store it in Evernote so that it’s searchable later. I know a lot of people who are into that visual note-taking approach, the sketch notes idea. Do you have a particular way you like to do it? Is there a format? Do you have a shorthand of visual symbols? No, it’s not particularly organized. They look probably like doodles. I find that what I’ll do is, I’ll just take notes during a meeting, and then later I’ll go back and kind of draw and organize them at the same time … create dividers, draw in little pictures, sort of summarize, and then the key things jump out at me later when I go back to look at them. Key numbers, sometimes I’ll draw a little picture to indicate something that was important. So notes are a cornerstone of how you manage your time. Is there anything else that you use? Do you have a particular toolkit? I think it’s really just document everything. And then, for the key things that I have to do every week, that I cannot miss, which is basically keeping up-to-date and communicating with companies that we might want to invest in, or might be passing on … keeping a running list of those, and making sure that those really, really important to-do’s get done. […] I feel like my brain is not particularly organized, kind of like a black box. And then, occasionally, connections will spark, and I’ll come to some sort of Eureka moment about a company, or a trend, or an idea that I want to go back on, and then I have it all there at my fingertips in Evernote, so I can go back and search for it. That’s what creativity and innovation are, really, isn’t it? It’s making those connections. It’s finding those moments of spark between the things that you’ve already collected and just drawing that new link. There are so many inputs in our world, and in our lives. We’re constantly getting messages from all sorts of different apps and media and we’re expected to deal with it all. “Information Overload” is not a new term, that’s been around for decades, but it’s still very much with us. How do you manage it? I try to clear the slate in my brain as well. If something is not immediately important, I just kind of tuck it away, and hopefully that black box brings it up at the right moment, the random spark of connection. But I think it’s important to keep the slate clean. I find that yoga helps clearing the slate as well, so that’s something small that I do. This is a partial transcript of our interview.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Is Caffeine Your Productivity Friend?", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/is-caffeine-your-productivity-friend/", "abstract": "A year ago, just before my son went off to college, he got a tattoo of a pr’ankh, an Egyptian hieroglyph meaning “house of life.” As a lifelong actor and dancer, he proclaimed his body as the “house of his life” and promised to take care of it for the rest of his days. Among other health-related pledges, he swore off drinking coffee and all caffeine products. By the time he came home for the summer, though, the coffee mug was reluctantly back in his hand.  What had happened? He hadn’t become any less dedicated to caring for his body, he hadn’t stopped his extensive workout or dance routines, and he hadn’t broken any of his other vows. He hadn’t even changed his opinion of caffeine. So why did he re-open the door to coffee? The global love affair with caffeine Many of us have had the same experience. According to AARP, 90 percent of all adults consume caffeine daily. The allure of coffee, it seems, is stronger than the brew itself. It is ingrained in all of us, in almost every culture on earth, that caffeine makes us more productive. But does it? Despite a plethora of articles extolling the virtues of caffeine and a multitude of research about it, no evidence directly equates caffeine and productivity. But, there is plenty of scientific evidence that caffeine gives you a jolt of energy, and helps you wake up in the morning. It makes you more alert, to be sure. It increases your focus, raises your blood pressure and heart rate, and it even makes you feel good. But if you want to be more productive, there’s no super-beverage that’s going to do that for you. In short, “alert” doesn’t necessarily equal “productive.” Recently, we spoke to productivity expert Tiago Forte , who mentioned his own excursion away from caffeine and subsequent return. He noticed that it wasn’t the coffee itself, but the other needs coffee satisfied that drove him back to it. Coffee provides an excuse to take a much-needed break from work. It provides a social outlet, particularly if you’re a solo worker. In many offices, going out for coffee is considered an acceptable reason to leave work, and many of us consider the nearest Starbucks our personal conference room away from the office. It gives us a place to meet friends and hang out. It has become the default mode for mid-day socializing. Find other outlets for those needs, Tiago said, and the coffee itself becomes irrelevant. Caffeine and you: is the love really mutual? But, we like the effects of caffeine, especially in the morning. And we’re not fond of the pounding in our temples that comes when we skip it. It’s a benign addiction, we reason, and, as research shows, it would take more than eight cups of coffee a day, or more than 400mg of caffeine before we suffer any ill effects. So if it gives us renewed energy, it isn’t loaded with calories (until we add sugar, milk, syrups, and whipped cream), it produces a sense of well-being, and we just like the taste, are there any downsides? A 12-year study conducted by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) threw a little cold water on the party. They concluded in 2015 that heavy use of caffeine products, primarily coffee, by young adults who were already predisposed to mild hypertension, increased the risk of heart attacks by four times. Even moderate use, which they categorized as one to three cups of coffee per day, increased the risk threefold. Through the use of genetic testing, the ESC was able to determine more. If an adult has mild hypertension and has a genetic predisposition to metabolize caffeine slowly, the risk for prediabetes is also greater. So if your blood pressure is already high, you may want to look for a non-stimulant method of finding the energy within. In Australia, the University of Sydney produced a similar study that tracked almost 5000 people back in 1985, and they discovered significant increases in indigestion in both men and women who consumed just 240 mg of caffeine, which is equal to four or five eight-ounce cups of coffee or tea per day. However, with the advent of other caffeine-laced products like sodas and energy drinks, the question remains whether it is caffeine itself that causes indigestion or the high acid content in coffee in particular. In either case, caffeine was found to be the culprit in reports of increased problems with insomnia. After all, its main benefit is keeping us alert. Focus vs. creativity: which is better with caffeine? Another case to consider: a large proportion of medication to control ADHD symptoms are stimulants that work exactly the way caffeine does. Why? Because those medications, in medically-supervised dosages, help those with ADHD to focus better. Caffeine has the same effect on the rest of the population. And while increased focus may help us get more done, one study done by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) produced an unexpected conclusion: more intense focus can be detrimental to creativity. In other words, when we’re hyperfocused, we lose the ability to make the creative connections we can easily make when our minds are allowed to wander. And that brings us back to our original query: what does caffeine really do for us in terms of productivity? And the answer, it seems, is “it depends.” If you define productivity as quantitative output, and you know that caffeine gives you that kick you need to get a lot of stuff done, it’s your best friend. If your productivity is based on how creative you are, then it might just make you feel alert. However, your altered brain chemistry will make it harder for you to access your fertile imagination. As for my son, it was a combination of Tiago Forte’s observations about the social aspects of coffee and a need to be alert in long lecture classes that brought him back to the brew. But because he is also a creative, he naturally shies away from caffeine during his performance classes. Research validates his natural inclinations, but one thing is certain: there is no chemical that can “make” you productive. Caffeine helps keep you awake and focused. What you do with your alertness is entirely up to you.", "date": "2017-08-29,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Inside Evernote: Ammar Khaku", "author": ["Forrest Dylan Bryant"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/inside-evernote-ammar-khaku/", "abstract": "Evernote is more than an app or a service; it’s also an outstanding team of dedicated individuals, and we’d like to share their stories with you. Ammar Khaku is a Senior Software Engineer on Evernote’s service backend team. He has been with the company since 2012. Tell us about your background. I did my undergrad at Tufts University in the Boston area. My primary focus was actually in mechanical engineering, although I also majored in computer science. I didn’t really do any programming until I took an intro to CS class my sophomore year. Three years later, I started at Evernote right out of school. Most of my experience is on the web side of things, pretty even across backend work and front-end work. Why Evernote? While working an internship in college, I came across a comment in the code that was something like “…a full description of this algorithm is in <someone>’s Evernote”. That was the first time I had heard about the product, and so I tried it out and fell in love with it. When applying to companies I looked mostly at places I had heard of and whose products I had used. Evernote stood out as a company that makes a fantastic product that people are passionate about, so when it came time to choose a place to work, Evernote was a clear winner. What is the biggest technical challenge at Evernote right now? I am one of the many engineers who work on our web stack, the “Evernote Web Service” — the backbone of our product and infrastructure. While we’ve done plenty of refactoring and rewriting, the core architecture of our service and even our data model haven’t changed much in the past 8 years. However, at the scale we’re at now, the direction we want to take the product and the speed at which we want to take it there, we’re hitting all sorts of walls that involve a lot of thinking and work to fix for the long term. This includes scaling limits like how many users we can support at a time, infrastructure limits on the types of use cases we want to enable, and even process limits such as maintaining code quality with entire teams of developers working in tandem. We’re at a phase now where we need to rethink our infrastructure, mature our engineering processes, and improve our tooling to allow us to focus on delivering value for our users. We have big plans on the product front, and so we somehow need to retool on the fly and make our service more resilient, while enhancing our product’s capabilities and driving the growth of our business. And that’s not all: since we develop native clients in-house, we need to develop those while maintaining support on the service for older clients — our users would be pretty upset if an older version of the Windows client suddenly stopped working. There is a lot of work to be done across our native clients, service, and the infrastructure, and while we’ve made good progress so far, we’re nowhere near where we aspire to be. How much freedom and autonomy is there in engineering? One of my favorite things about working here is the freedom we get to take on projects we find interesting, irrespective of what the domain is. Some companies break up their engineering organizations and domains such that each group is responsible for one section of code, and to monkey with other parts of the codebase they have to go through a whole bunch of protocols and negotiate with other teams. At Evernote, you’re free to spend time refactoring or adding features to any part of the codebase — all you have to do is submit a pull request and have one of the people familiar with that code take a look. If you’re curious about how part of our stack works, stroll over to anyone familiar with it and ask them if they have time for a quick overview. Evernote encourages the sharing of knowledge across teams; the higher our “bus factor” is, the better. For the times where you want to work on something that doesn’t even remotely fall into our overall company goals, we hold an annual “hack week” where we pause product development and work on projects we find interesting. A lot of hack week projects even end up in our product. What is the most satisfying part of your job? Given how large our user base is, one of the most satisfying feelings is releasing something into the wild and seeing people use what we built. It’s scary watching metrics as people use something you worked on and you built, but also exhilarating to follow along and watch usage trends. The work we do has a direct impact on millions of users, whether it’s page load times, first launch experiences, or smarter searching. For instance, I spent some time on the web client team and we rewrote the majority of our app, giving it a new look and feel as well as a whole new plumbing system. A bunch of us were sitting and watching the number of users opting in to our beta grow at an increasing rate, and we were also monitoring the customer response on our forums. My favorite memory of this was a forum post talking about how the new web client felt faster and more responsive; we spent a while tweaking animations and deferring loading of data and code in an effort to make the client feel faster, and it was an awesome validation of our efforts to see feedback like that. What is one piece of advice you would give to an engineer who is interested in joining Evernote? A lot of what we’re looking for is the ability to think through a problem and work your way in the direction of a solution. We don’t expect everyone to come up with a perfect solution, we’re usually looking more for the problem-solving process. Instead of jumping straight to an implementation, clarify the problem, gather requirements, come up with a high-level design and then start the implementation. Another important factor is the ability to work with others. We work pretty collaboratively, with other engineers and with product, design, QA, and analytics, so one of the things important to us is whether or not you can work well in a team. We’re looking for people who are communicative, and can put themselves in another person’s shoes to figure what they really mean, since everyone has their own perspective. We’re also looking for people who can adapt to changing requirements, since that is a reality with a consumer-focused product. What is a fun fact about you? I’m sort-of, kind-of, maybe slightly addicted to hockey. I started playing (ice, of course) hockey a little over three years ago and it’s grown to a point where I spend more time skating than anything except work. I’ve done some borderline crazy things for hockey — I flew back from an LA visit early once, had a friend pick me up at SFO with my hockey gear, and take me straight to a game. I drove from a hockey camp (for adults, yes those exist) in Roseville to play a game with my team in Oakland at 11pm, and got back to Roseville at 2am, got some sleep, then back on the ice for an 8am session. I’m not very good, but it’s an awesome sport, and you can’t match the camaraderie. If you skate in the Silver league in Oakland we’ve probably met on the ice.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Does Gratitude Make Us More Productive?", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/does-gratitude-make-us-more-productive/", "abstract": "We’ve all been encouraged to feel more grateful. But in today’s fast-paced life, we can find ourselves perpetually focusing on what’s next at the expense of recognizing the beauty around us. The rise of the smartphone means that we could always theoretically be responding to work emails. When we scroll through our Facebook timelines, it’s easy to compare ourselves to other people’s highlight reels and feel we aren’t enough. But could taking just a couple of minutes out of our busy days to practice gratitude make us more successful? Is there measurable backing behind the idea that gratitude is better for us? Research shows that this powerful emotion can heighten health, happiness, and productivity – at home and in the workplace. Today, we’re unpacking the psychology of gratitude, explaining how it works, and giving you tips for how you can cultivate it for yourself. Defining “gratitude” The word “gratitude” comes from the Medieval Latin word for “thankfulness.” While there’s no single psychological definition of gratitude, leading researchers Robert Emmons and Cheryl Crumpler describe it as “an emotional response to a gift. It is the appreciation felt after one has been the beneficiary of an altruistic act.” Gratitude has a social valence to it. It connects us with other people, life, and depending on our belief system, a higher power. We might feel it when the person in front of us in line spontaneously pays for our coffee, or when a friend checks in on us unexpectedly during a hard time. We’ve all probably felt it after having a win at work and being reminded why we do what we do. In his book Thanks!: How the New Science of Gratitude Can Make You Happier , Emmons breaks down that emotional response into two stages. He shares : “First, gratitude is the acknowledgment of goodness in one’s life. In gratitude, we say yes to life. We affirm that all things taken together, life is good and has elements that make it worth living. Second, gratitude is recognizing that the source(s) of this goodness lie at least partially outside the self. The object of gratitude is other-directed… This is one significant way in which gratitude differs from other emotional dispositions.” In other words, gratitude is a process of seeing and metabolizing what we already have – amidst the chaos of our schedules – which helps us feel connected to other people and life. We can feel grateful about something thrilling (for example, a promotion at work) or smaller scale gifts that we haven’t noticed before. Less obvious gifts, like the kindness of the people who make your coffee every morning or the person who always remembers to empty the trash, are all around – but we never seem to notice them, let alone be thankful for them. How gratitude impacts us Sure, feeling grateful might be calming in the moment. But can cultivating gratitude change the course of our lives at work? Research in the field of positive psychology offers strong evidence that both feeling and expressing gratitude positively influences our emotions and health, and can inspire those results in others. One study showed that when we express gratitude to our partners, the partner is more likely to feel positively towards us and communicate about concerns in the relationship. Another showed how managers who expressed gratitude to their employees generated 50 percent higher productivity. These findings upend the idea that people are motivated to work or change as a way to move away from a negative emotion, like the fear of being reprimanded by a boss or criticized by their partner. Perhaps we’re more productive when we’re appreciated. On an individual level, feeling grateful fosters stronger romantic relationships and makes us happier and healthier , in part by inducing the relaxation response in the body. In one study , researchers explored the impact of keeping a gratitude journal, finding that journaling about what we’re thankful for could have a variety of physical and emotional benefits. In the first of three studies, participants were randomly assigned to three groups: those who wrote about life hassles, another group wrote down things they were grateful for, and the third group tracked neutral life events. They journaled weekly. In the second study, participants were assigned to the same three groups but were asked to journal daily. In the third study, a group of participants with neuromuscular disease was randomly assigned to either the gratitude condition or a control one. After ten weeks, participants who journaled about what they were grateful for on a weekly basis reported being 25 percent happier versus those participating in the hassle condition. They exercised an average of 1.5 hours more, and reported less physical symptoms (like headaches, shortness of breath, and chest pain). Journaling daily produced even greater increases in happiness, and the participants with neuromuscular disease assigned to the gratitude condition reported getting more refreshing sleep and a more optimistic outlook on their lives versus the control condition. And more happiness and better sleep aren’t just nice-to-haves: these factors make us, among other things, more focused and productive . While these studies don’t prove causation, they highlight that we should practice cultivating gratitude and see what works for us. Pro tip: Track your gratitude by keeping it in Evernote. Snap a picture to remind you of what you’re grateful for, jot it down on either your computer or mobile device, or use our “Daily Re-charge Questions” template . For a quick mood-booster, review what you’ve written. Practicing gratitude at work Expressing gratitude has even been shown to create positive shifts at the office. One study , c o n d u c t e d b y the University of Pennsylvania, set out to explore how perceptions about our value at work (in this case, by managers) impact behavior on the job. Researchers randomly divided participants – who were university fundraisers – into two groups. The experiments showed that when managers expressed appreciation for the employee’s work, productivity went up significantly. For example, one group of participants received a “thank you” pep talk before starting work. That group made 50 percent more fundraising calls than their peers who didn’t get thanked. The idea that expressing gratitude creates a positive cycle – where the person showing thankfulness feels good and the person being appreciated does, too – is an important one for managers, leaders, and culture builders. It’s too easy to focus on what needs to be accomplished (by definition, what’s lacking ) rather than acknowledging what we already have. But failing to acknowledge workers has a clear impact on productivity and job satisfaction. Gratitude in action Given the importance of gratitude, here are three research – backed tips for cultivating it and building a culture of appreciation: Keep a daily gratitude journal. Research suggests that spending just five minutes per day writing down what you’re grateful for can increase your sense of well-being by about 10 percent . If you journal at night, you’ll conclude the day on a relaxed note, which can help you get deeper sleep and work more effectively. Plus, you’ll train your mind to notice things to be grateful for throughout the day. You can also keep a digital gratitude journal in Evernote and record what you’re grateful for throughout the day. Buy a box of thank you cards and send them out regularly. Appreciate your mom helping with the kids this weekend? A team member who went above and beyond during a launch? Your friend who helped you through a tough situation? Sit down and write them a note. This practice will help you relive what you appreciated and others feel more fulfilled. Through expressing gratitude, we can inspire happier, more positive emotions in others. Find ways to discuss what you appreciate about your colleagues. It may sound obvious, but celebrating your fellow team members both lifts them up and inspires them to continue doing the good stuff. You could publicly thank people in meetings, or send a “Thanks so much for your help” email, or simply mention what you appreciate in conversation. Feeling and expressing gratitude isn’t just the “right” thing to do – it creates a ripple effect of more health, happiness, and effectiveness in the office and at home.", "date": "2017-09-8,"},

How best to use it? Read this comprehensive guide to different types of note-taking, and decide which styles resonate with the way you think. The best part? They all work in Evernote. In classrooms and lecture halls around the world, millions of students—from elementary schools to the highest levels of collegiate research —bear the torch as our most consistent note-takers. While we’ve experienced massive shifts in technology over the course of the past four decades, the essence and methodology of note-taking remain largely intact. Same purpose. Different medium. Whether scribbling shorthand in a notebook or capturing lecture notes on a laptop or mobile device, students still need to find ways to remember what they are taught. Note-taking is essential to the learning process. Organizing Information For centuries, we’ve been distracted. No matter your profession or pursuits, interpreting and capturing information is more challenging than it seems. Students experience this every day. Research shows us that overcoming information overload begins with organization. For students, this starts with having a system for organizing their notes. How students organize notes can have an enormous impact on how well they can recall it later. Perhaps that’s why professors at Ivy League schools designed their note-taking systems to help students organize information more efficiently. From commonplace (at Harvard and Oxford in the 1800s) to Cornell (1960s New York), best practices for note-taking became a critical component of education. Today, academic institutions such as California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University still place a premium on educating students about note-taking methodology. But, most of these approaches are designed for paper and pencil. Many universities still point students toward online resources that offer advice designed for the pencil-based note-taker. That’s a testament to the perseverance of tradition, but it’s also indicative of a need to empower students to use technology to capture and study notes. Image: The Stanford University Academic Center provides writing tips for paper-based note-taking using the Cornell Method. How we Learn to Remember As students, we learn through exposure to information. We keep a record of that information, and, following repeated exposures to the information, we can recall it later during exams, pop quizzes, and tests. Nowadays, the use of smartphones and tablets for note-taking can significantly improve the learning process: Capture and record only the information you don’t know. Identify the most important material. Remember the information by setting time to review it later. Recall the information when it is needed (research, connecting ideas to writing, exams). Psychologists say that to recall information and build knowledge, it’s essential to understand three distinct stages of memory. Interestingly, they mirror the phases of note-taking: Encoding (writing down notes, capturing information, capture audio, photographs). Storage (physical notebook, pen and paper, or a digital system like Evernote). Retrieval (revisiting and reading your notes and the information you captured). For students, it’s a time-honored system: Capture the knowledge and then find a system to retain that knowledge so that it will be usefully applied in moments that test your abilities later—exams, quizzes, and tests. Choosing Your Note Style Note-taking is deeply personal. How you implement a particular method mirrors not only your productivity habits but also the way you think and your creative workflow. For some people, organizing information into outline formats and lists is the key to success. For others, it’s all about visual systems that help them see information in a new light. No matter your system, the challenge is universal: how do we parse the noise, sift through information, and decide what’s important? Though the process sounds complicated, there are two primary classifications of note-taking systems: linear and nonlinear. But the method you use depends on personal choice, the class environment you’re in, and the way your brain works. These are the most common approaches—all of which are easy to implement in Evernote. The Outline Method With origins dating back to the 1500s, the outline is a classic paper and pencil style of linear note-taking in which you take capture information alongside Roman or Arabic numerals. Its durability is part of its legacy—it works on paper, but it’s also easy to adapt and implement digitally. With a linear outline, you can also use bullet points or other characters and symbols. This tactic of note-taking works in almost any class setting, and helps you record content quickly. In addition to capturing key points, it also helps you catalog and remember what the subtopics have to do with the bigger concepts. Because this style of note-taking aims to capture the most important parts of a lecture, it’s easy to turn your notes into questions you can use later to study for exams. The Cornell Method Originally invented in the 1950s at its namesake university, Cornell is considered by many to be the Cadillac of note-taking systems. Broken down into three distinct sections, the Cornell system allows you to capture and retrieve information in a single place. Using Cornell, you can hone in on major concepts and ideas in lectures and build learning from there. This system is perfect for high school or college students in lecture situations. It is also a good system for attorneys and knowledge workers. Here’s how it works: Record: During a lecture, use the note-taking column on the left to record the lecture using sentences. Questions: Formulate questions in the right-hand column based on your class notes, shortly after class ends (while they’re fresh on your mind). Writing questions helps to clarify meanings, reveal relationships, establish continuity, and strengthen memory. Jotting down questions also sets the stage for exam-studying later. Recite : Cover the note-taking column with a sheet of paper. Then, looking at the questions or cue-words in the right-hand column only, say aloud, in your own words, the answers to the questions, facts, or ideas indicated by the cue words. Reflect: Reflect on the material by asking yourself questions, for example: “What’s the significance of these facts? What principle are they based on? How can I apply them? How do they fit in with what I already know? What’s beyond them? Review: Spend at least ten minutes every week reviewing all your previous notes. If you do, you’ll retain a great deal for the exam. Additional tips helpful for Cornell: Add symbols for clarity. Add highlights, underlines, or symbols around information that is important to your studies. If you can, avoid writing out entire sentences. The point of note-taking is to clue yourself into things your professor indicates may be important, and to help create personal study guides. Shorthand. Create your own shorthand language to help you type faster. If you use abbreviated language to chat with friends on Snapchat, implement it into your note-taking. Use w/ (with) and % (for percentages). The Sentence Method This method is a good way to capture content in sentence-sized pieces. Although you lose the ability to organize through numbered or bulleted lists, the sentence method allows you to capture a running list of information that is new to you. Since what you have written is not organized into paragraphs, you can return and review material later. Sentences have the benefit of making sense because of they are easily readable. If you type quickly, and if the information is presented in an organized manner, this may be the perfect note-taking system for you. Mind Mapping If you’re a visual thinker, then mind maps are an opportunity for you to connect ideas and notes together visually. In class, mind maps are an efficient way to sketch out topics. Here’s one Evernote customer’s mind-map for remembering how to use Evernote. In this method, sketching and doodling are encouraged because these types of drawings are relevant to the notes. More tips for taking great notes From annotations to highlights, here are some additional ways to take your notes to the next level. Attend lectures regularly. It goes without saying that consistent class attendance is a huge part of being successful in school. You have to absorb lecture material in class to understand textbook reading and to prepare g for exams and final projects. Become an active reader. When you’re studying for class or developing ideas for writing projects, push hard to read actively and understand the material. Ask questions. Think through the material you’re reading. Cite sources. Many classes require annotated bibliographies, so you’ll save time if you capture your sources as you study. Use Amazon Kindle. Capture and save your Kindle notes and highlights into Evernote in a few simple steps. Blinkist. Blinkist curates the world’s best business books and distills them into manageable, easily readable 15-minute summaries offered in both text and audio formats in a mobile app for smartphones, tablets, and any web browser.

Paul McCartney woke up one morning with “Yesterday” playing in his mind; Sir Isaac Newton (allegedly) developed his theory of gravity after an apple landed on his head . History is filled with stories like these, but how many great ideas were lost because there was no way of capturing them in the moment? Now, with the launch of Apple’s iOS 11 , it’s easier than ever to document your own “Aha!” moments, whenever and wherever they appear. Thanks to a brand-new integration with Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant, you don’t even need to touch your device to create, add to, and search your notes in Evernote . So you’ll be ready when your next brilliant idea comes along. What’s the big deal? In a world that seems to be moving faster every day, keeping track of your thoughts and ideas can be a real challenge. To-do lists and business ideas compete for space in your life with long commutes and endless meetings. But now that Evernote is integrated with Siri, you don’t have to stop being productive simply because you’re busy doing other things. Create a shopping list on your iPad while you’re making breakfast; add to-dos to Evernote on your iPhone while you’re stuck in traffic; create a note with your EarPods while you’re working out. Here’s how it works Before you begin, ensure that Evernote is setup to use Siri by going to Settings > Siri & Search > Evernote > Enable “Use with Siri”. Awaken Siri on your device (either by holding the Home button or, if you’ve enabled it, saying “Hey Siri”) and then give your instructions directly to Evernote. It’s that simple! For example, here are a few commands you can try right now, once you’ve updated your device to iOS 11: “Create a note in Evernote called Meeting Ideas,” or “Create a note called Meeting Ideas in Evernote.” “Add ‘I should bring pizza’ to my Meeting Ideas note in Evernote.” “Create a list in Evernote with ‘Order lunch’ and ‘Make itinerary,’” or “Create a list with ‘Order lunch’ and ‘Make itinerary’ in Evernote.” “Show me the notes I created today in Evernote.” Using these simple commands, you can create a note or list; you can add to your existing notes; and you can search within your notes to find exactly what you need. With Evernote and iOS 11 integrated seamlessly, you never need to worry about losing your ideas again.

Jay Acunzo, an award-winning podcaster and dynamic keynote speaker, has a surprising answer: Intuition. Before creating the popular podcast show Unthinkable , Jay was a digital media strategist at Google and later head of content at HubSpot. But realized he was unhappy, and that this highly sought-after path was simply not for him. This experience sparked an interest in intuition and unconventional thinking that we explore in the latest episode of the Taking Note podcast . On the show, Jay discusses why our intuition plays a huge importance in our happiness and well-being. Everyone has unique experiences and unique perspectives, which means that the status quo may not always be the best path for us. But it’s not about trusting your gut or following a muse. It’s about using self-awareness to empower ourselves to do more. You have infinite access to the tools that reveal what direction you will find most fulfilling and meaningful in your work, so use your intuition and unconventional thinking to get yourself there.

Here are some selected highlights from our interview. To hear the rest, click on the player above or look for us on iTunes , SoundCloud , Overcast , or your podcast platform of choice. A lot of your work, I know is built around to this concept of intuition. How do you personally define that? The ability to succeed at higher speed. We have all these definitions of intuition in our world, and it’s surprising who’s tried to define it. Albert Einstein is not a guy you’d associate with intuition. He’s been given this quote; whether it was him or not is uncertain, but he called it a feeling for the order lying behind the appearance of something. Malcolm Gladwell called it ‘Rapid cognition’. Then, my wife is actually a research psychologist, and she turned me onto a couple guys who are currently doing their research around similar decision-making ideas, Gary Klein and Gerd Gigerenzer. They’re looking at subconscious reasoning or a concept called ‘Priming’ in the psychology world. “Intuition is the ability to succeed at a higher speed.” I was an English Lit major, and so I keep it pretty simple. If you look at the root of the word itself, ‘intuition’, it comes from this Latin word intuere , which just means knowledge from within. I like to think of intuition as your ability to find knowledge from within, and I think in this era of advice overload, and experts everywhere, and just so much information, especially if you’re in business, it’s never been a better time to think for yourself. And if we can look at our intuition as a way to do that, and a way to do that faster and faster the more we use it, I think we become incredibly powerful for our companies and for our own careers, so I like to say that intuition is the ability to succeed at higher speed. If self-awareness is the key, where do you recommend we start to undertake that journey? Especially in a work context, where we tend to focus so much on the external, on the things that are laid out before us, on the bounds of the job, on the roles that are already laid out? I think it’s the difference between obsessing over somebody else’s answers and asking yourself the right questions, and I use intuition as the shorthand for that phrase because again, intuere , knowledge from within. How do you find knowledge from within or how do you find knowledge in your own context versus the general advice? You have to ask the right questions to investigate, and so my podcast, Unthinkable , that’s why I started it. From the outside looking in, these people are doing crazy things at work, but then, you hear their story, and they were just investigators or obsessors over their own context. They ask the right questions of the world around them, their customers, themselves, their resources, and so they went down a logical path just like you would. It’s just that they knew something you didn’t, and from the outside looking in, it was hard to find. Again, I think it’s this culture we live in of trying to find the answer so quickly, the one that’s so easy, the cheat, the hack, the tip or trick. Switch from that mentality to a more questioning state, and focus on your own context instead. You mentioned something at the beginning about finding higher speed through this as well. Where do you find the connection between intuition and a higher speed of what you’re putting out? What do we chalk up intuition to usually, like a mystical muse or a gut feeling? It’s still though, it’s still you doing the thinking. Right? Your gut doesn’t have thoughts, and there certainly is no such thing as some external muse that hands you something when you’re born or something in the moment of thinking, so I hope we would all agree that you’re having these thoughts quickly, but it’s still you doing the process. I like to think of conventional thinking as a set of instructions. It’s a linear way of thinking, and intuition is like an exponential curve.[…] Do you remember the formula for calculating the slope of a straight line? It’s rise over run. That’s it. Basically, it’s the up versus the out, and to calculate a straight line, all you need are two points anywhere on it, and you could really easily see where it came from and where it takes you. It’s the seven secrets to success from your favorite expert, and if you follow them ostensibly, you’ll find success, so people can easily get onboard with that kind of stuff because they can see where it came from, and they can see where it leads them. “Conventional thinking is a set of instructions. It’s a linear way of thinking, and intuition is like an exponential curve.” Now, when you think about intuition or thinking for yourself or coming up with a new idea that’s off the beaten path, it’s like this exponential curve, and if you think about how to calculate exponential curves, it’s much more complex. In other words, you don’t need two points on the line. In my case, you would need a Ph.D. in math, and if you’re me as an English Lit major, you’d need like a bottle of bourbon as well. It’s just really hard to understand when I can’t see very clearly where it came from or where it takes you. […] I just feel it. I just know. Right? The thing is, it’s you doing the thinking, but you did it really quickly, and I think the reason is you are probably the type of person who throughout your life slowly by slowly, bit by bit, asked questions of things, found your own answer, proposed ideas, and at first, you were probably bad at it and it even happened slowly, like you have to articulate, “Okay. I’m asking this question. What’s the answer?” If that’s your default setting, the more you use that, the more over time you feel like you went really fast. You arrived at the conclusion really quickly, and again, I think that’s what an exponential curve is. It’s that ability to succeed at higher speed. What’s wrong with absorbing and following the best practices for your field? If somebody’s been successful at doing something, surely, they’ve been doing something right. What’s wrong with that? I don’t think anything is wrong with consuming, studying, and absorbing the convention, whether the convention is brand new or it’s been around for decades. I don’t think anything is wrong with that. I think it’s when we stop at that or when we view these experts of which there are more than ever or these trends of which there are more than ever seemingly. We like to glom onto them when we view that stuff as final answers for us, instead of what they really are, which is possibilities that we have to vet. I think what we do is we stagnate or we fail to realize our full potential. I think of it this way. You work for Evernote, I’ve worked for Google and all sorts of tech companies. We adore this information age that we live in because there’s more choice, possibility. You name it. It’s a glorious thing, but there is a dark side to it, and I mentioned it quickly before, and I think that dark side is advice overload. What happens is because we can quickly find ideas and answers from others, we often use those things to then do our work, which creates commodity stuff. A perfect example in my world of content marketing is when the big study from X-Tech Company comes out, researching the best time to tweet, and they pronounce it 3:00 PM. Guess what happens now that that’s out there? That’s no longer the best time to tweet. Coming up with an idea or an insight is one thing. Figuring out whether it’s worth following is another, so how do you determine if a new idea is worthwhile? What your process or criteria? Everybody I’ve talked to on the show, it’s all the same two underlying questions that people start with that I think helps them that whether or not that idea is pursuing. One is about self-awareness. The other is about audience awareness, so it’s about the person doing the work, you, and the person receiving the work, them. The question about you is, “What is my aspirational anchor?” What that does is it anchors you to something personal that gives you a filter through which you can vet all the advice of others, all the ideas you come up with, and an aspiration is just the simple combination of two very powerful things: your intent for the future, and your hunger that you have from today, some kind of dissatisfaction. I call that the ‘Aspirational anchor.’ Once you have that self-awareness, now, you can ask this next question about your audience, which is, “What is my first-principle insight about them?” A first-principle insight very simply is some kind of basic, but hard-to-reach truth about the people you’re trying to reach. You have to sit with thoughts and ask “Why?” a lot to get to that fact. “An aspiration is just the simple combination of two very powerful things: your intent for the future, and your hunger that you have from today.” I’ll give you a great example of an epic company that a lot of I think Evernote users and listeners would really appreciate. The company is called Death Wish Coffee . Have you heard of those guys? They bill themselves as the strongest coffee in the world. They’re the world’s strongest coffee.… Mike Brown is the founder, and he heard these questions from the same type of customer over and over again, truck drivers, construction workers, hard-charging people. They asked, “What’s the strongest cup of coffee you can make me?” Most of us would assume that this insight you now have as a business is customers want stronger coffee, but Mike was like, “Okay. Why? They want more caffeine.” Okay. That step is obvious. “Why?” They want more energy. Again, obvious. “Why?” If you know your audience, you’re like, “They’re truck drivers, construction workers, founders of companies. These guys are hard-charging, hard-working individuals, so they want to work incredibly hard.” In other words, they want the ability to work themselves to death, so that’s exactly what Mike sells. Right? He is the only one in the coffee business who sells that ability, while everybody else sells stronger coffee, more caffeine, and more energy. I think too often, we stop at the superficial level and try to sell that, but if we can combine the first-principle insight with our own aspirational anchor and find that overlapping thing in the middle, now we have this command of our own context essentially, and that’s our filter on whether or not our idea is worth executing or someone else’s advice is worth heeding. What’s your daily routine look like? Oh, my goodness. Wow. It’s very non-linear. If you can’t tell by my energy, if you could see me right now, it’s a lot of hand waving because I am Italian and I think my work has the same cadence and process. It’s a lot of hand-waving and a lot of froth, but I try to focus on the one or two big things that I have to get done and find a way to break those down into smaller chunks. I try to really start at the end and then see, “What are all the steps I feel I need or at least the first couple to go towards that end result, whether it’s a concrete moment a time or just a grand aspiration. It does vary, but I think mostly, it breaks down to the most important things I need to get done to continue down that path, and I think it’s really helpful when you like the path you’re on to operate that way. How about your Evernote usage? Is there any particular way that you like to organize your notes or any structure? Yeah. I’m looking at it right now. Actually, I have one master [notebook stack] called ‘Unthinkable’, and then the first [notebook] is ‘To-dos’, and that has one note in it that has a list of important to-dos in a checklist, and then any progress I’m making underneath. If I’m working on preparing for a launch of a new episode, I might have that in the To-do list, and then I might have the promotional ideas for that episode in a separate note beneath it. Then, my world really breaks into four parts, all of which are neatly categorized in Evernote. I have Production , so it’s like the content I’m making, I have Products , so that’s things I’m developing for the audience that adds more value. Some are paid, some are not. I have Speaking , and so that’s information on events that I’m about to go to and their audiences so I can improve the speech or ideas for my speaking to improve, and then I have one that I think is my most important because I think it’s the thing I find it so hard to do in our crazy, frenetic world, and that’s just called Thinking . It’s “Can I get two, three hours on a Friday, go for a walk, read some things, to our points earlier, make myself sensitive to do possibilities, instead of just continue into the rut that I’m in?” I like the rut I’m in, which makes it hard, but thinking is this Evernote [notebook] to me, that’s the most precious one because I don’t know where anything in there is going to lead to. It’s almost like a swipe file of potential, but so often, I find a way to pull out of it and insert it into the other stuff I’m working on. That’s my process, but it’s also just the way I think I organize my brain. This is a partial transcript. For the full conversation with Jay, be sure to listen to the podcast.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Unleashing Creativity in a STEM World", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/unleashing-creativity-in-a-stem-world/", "abstract": "Over hundreds of years, the way we educate children has remained largely unchanged. Children go to school, where they’re taught to memorize facts and figures. Later, teachers test the students on how much of that information they remember. Very little of the average student’s formal schooling centers around creativity. What exists today of creative studies—fine art, music, drama, creative writing, and other arts—are being eroded by budget cuts, a belief that creative studies are frivolous, and a growing movement toward STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) classes as the answer to ensuring success in every child’s future. Yet creativity is the key to success in careers, and happiness in life. There’s nothing wrong with STEM; in fact, these classes are essential for society to move forward, But they’re only part of the equation. It takes creativity to look at hard facts and figures and imagine the different ways we can put them to use. After all, it’s the imaginative mind that turns raw data into products, roads, buildings, medicines and vaccines, and even space stations and rockets that explore other planets. And these, in turn, provide more data, and more innovation. It’s a compelling argument for giving STEM an ‘A’—for ‘Arts’— creating the “STEAM” that we need to advance our civilization. How we view creativity as a global society A 2016 survey by Adobe Corporation about creativity and business revealed some startling facts. 82 percent of the 5,000 respondents in the United States, Europe, and Japan said that creativity itself is the key to fostering innovation, and 79 percent thought that creativity is the key to increased productivity. In every country surveyed, a consistent 70 percent believed that developing creative skills is key to being better employees, leaders, students, and parents. Despite all that, only 41 percent thought of themselves as creative people. Around the world, only one in three people feel they are living up to their creative potential today. What’s going on here? Adobe’s report suggests two main causes for this “creativity gap:” the educational system, which respondents feel is stifling creativity, and the world of work, which is blamed for putting an emphasis on productivity instead of creativity. Creativity starts in the classroom In the educational world, some schools recognize the gap and are actively working to close it. The KhanLab School in Mountain View, California is a private, non-profit school founded by Salman Khan , the mind behind Khan Academy, which provides thousands of educational video tutorials. In a school without grade levels, students work on concepts until they master them, and only then do they move on to the next level. They work on the concept of “flipping the classroom,” or using traditional evening homework time for lessons (delivered via Khan Academy ). Class time is for creative application of the lessons, like robot-building, exploring the world around them, real-world experiments based on math and science lessons, and peer tutoring. The approach encourages and normalizes creativity, while not short-changing data-driven STEM subjects in the slightest. Arts educators have long advocated the importance of creativity as part of a well-rounded education. Though a controversial study in 2000 indicated that there is no direct causality between learning creative skills and school performance, Harvard University’s professor emeritus of education Elliot Eisner had a completely different take. “Not everything has a practical utility,” he explained in The New York Times . “Learning through the arts promotes the idea that there is more than one solution to a problem or more than one answer to a question.” Getting creative about worktime creativity Adobe’s annual survey reveals a growing rift between the concepts of creativity and productivity. More than three-quarters of the respondents felt pressure to be more productive than creative. The problem is that productivity is measurable, but creativity is not. And today’s corporate world revolves around metrics. It’s not possible to claim that you were 85 percent more creative this week than last week. As a result, creativity is often undervalued, leaving employees frustrated and feeling creatively stunted. It’s not possible to claim you were 85 percent more creative this week than last week. We have a difficult time defining creativity. Looking to metrics, people tend to lean toward equating creativity and problem-solving, and ignore the less tangible aspects of creativity. The irony is that creative thinking is a must for any company’s—or nation’s success. The same respondents who fretted they were not being allowed to be creative enough at work believed that workplace creativity is essential for economic growth. That gap was also clearly identified by Adobe, not only in 2016 but in every report since they started counting. Companies and governments see the crucial importance of creativity, employees want to be more creative at work, but the gap isn’t closing. As a result, 39 percent of employees restrict creative activities to second jobs or hobbies outside of their primary employment. Solving the Creativity Problem Being creative takes many forms. It doesn’t exist only with traditionally creative workers like writers and designers, but with anyone who sees a way to complete a task or a process more effectively, in people who are willing to take risks to try out new ideas, or look at a traditional product or service in a different way. Companies that are open to encouraging innovation from unexpected sources, and that are willing to experiment and fail are likely to have employees who are more personally invested in their jobs. That’s why Creativity at Work , a consortium of creative professionals, has contracted with some major corporations to help drive innovation in business through creative development. Creativity at Work founder Linda Naiman, herself an arts educator, believes in “whole brain creativity.” She teaches that analytical and operational intelligence can be taught to merge with creative and relational intelligence to foster a more artistic approach to business innovation. Through workshops, the organization helps companies close the creativity gap and help employees unleash their creative juices. Participants might be asked to paint or sculpt together, participate in theatre projects, or make music. The point, Neiman says, “is not to teach people to be artists but to create immersive learning experiences using artistic processes to help people gain new insights and perspectives about business challenges.” Arts education is lifelong learning That we are now retroactively training adults that it’s not only okay to be creative, but vital to their success and well-being points to the early educational bias against arts education. Too many parents discourage their children from artistic pursuits and especially from creative college majors. Many schools, in turn, treat arts classes as extra-curricular and irrelevant to a core education. They send the message that creativity isn’t important. But cutting off creative thinking in children risks making generations of adults who are unable to imaginatively find relationships and connections between seemingly unrelated things, generate new perspectives for problem-solving, or turn an idea into reality. So go ahead. Take the saxophone out of the back closet. Bring out the dusty tap shoes. Audition for a play or get the band back together. Get your hands back into the art supplies. It’s not only good for your soul, it’s good for your career. After all, the next big tech innovation is going to be somebody’s creative idea.", "date": "2017-09-27,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Own it: Take Personal Accountability to Work", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/own-it-take-personal-accountability-to-work/", "abstract": "With so many demands on our time, it’s easy to set a goal — whether it be to improve at a work-related skill, eat healthier, or devote more time to family — and not live up to our expectations. We’ve also all watched ourselves want to get from Point A to Point B, but not take the actions necessary to get there. Both can be frustrating. Part of the solution is to learn how to be more accountable to ourselves — to honestly assess a situation and take responsibility for our outcomes. When we’re accountable to ourselves, we’re better able to take responsibility for ourselves at work too. Defining accountability According to University of Mississippi Medical Center Professor Emeritus Marcia Rachel — who’s written about accountability in the medical field — there are different definitions of accountability. All of them involve five key ideas: Obligation , or a responsibility to accomplish something Willingness , or taking action because we want to rather than because we have to Intent , or the reason behind acting Ownership , or taking responsibility for our behavior and outcomes Commitment , or dedicating ourselves to the task or goal at hand. Becoming more accountable to ourselves and in the workplace breeds success – both for us and for our teams. Dr. Rachel explains, “[Accountability] is an energizing force throughout an organization. Where a culture of accountability exists, people do what they say they’ll do.” In other words, people choose to take responsibility for projects and outcomes, with the intention of reaching objectives. In order to take responsibility for ourselves in a work setting, we must first be able to be honest with and accountable to ourselves. For example, in a company that has a culture of accountability, managers might share honestly in a meeting about how they made a strategic miscalculation during a project. Rather than blaming the market or upper management, they’d explain their thought process, why it didn’t work, and what they’re doing to ensure it doesn’t happen again. Without being able to honestly assess the given situation ourselves, we can’t possibly improve it appropriately at work. “In contrast,” she continues, “an organization lacking accountability is full of excuses for not meeting objectives. Staff sense that ‘close to the target’ is good enough as no one will notice the difference.” Without accountability, employees might not trust their bosses or each other and work to get by rather than fulfill the organization’s core mission. Accountability facilitates achievement Being accountable isn’t just a matter of integrity. It’s also a success principle. It might sound obvious, but without owning our choices, it’s hard to make professional progress. In a review of dozens of studies on organizational management and research on workplace accountability, psychology researcher Arti Trivedi found that being more accountable allows us to be more accurate in our work, make better decisions, and feel more satisfied. All of those factors make us better workers, and presumably, help us be more successful. The four-step accountability plan To be more accountable, we need to have practical habits to take action on. Sometimes, we don’t hold ourselves accountable because we don’t know how. These strategies will help you make the rubber meet the road. Set concrete , detailed goals. Rather than deciding to “improve your performance at work,” set the goal to, for example, “take three continuing education courses by the end of the year.” By being specific, you’ll more easily be able to quantify if and when you’ve reached your goal. Clear goals beget clear results. Identify the behaviors it’ll take to reach your goals, and decide how often you’ll stick to them. For example, if your goal is to participate more in the community at work, you might decide to eat lunch with a new person every two weeks, stay off your phone when riding in the elevator, and attend at least the first half of any work event. By identifying the habits that’ll get you to your goals, the task becomes more digestible and it’s easier to assess if you’re moving forward or not. Schedule assessment dates. Along the path to your goal, make periodic assessments. Depending on the time period you’ve set out, this might be a quarter-way, half-way, and three-quarter way check-in. During your check-in, ask whether you’ve been consistently taking action. Look at any habits that need to be added in order to reach your goal. Make sure you’re assessing yourself with enough time to course correct and reach your goal in the time limit you set. Remember to think through the consequences of not being accountable to yourself. What will it cost you in money and life experiences, and in your relationship with yourself to not reach your goal? Sometimes when change feels hard, we have to remember that the cost of doing nothing may be higher in the long run. Pro Tip: Here’s a goal-setting template you can use in Evernote. A plan gives you a concrete structure to hold yourself to. Without planning, it’s less likely that you’ll be successful achieving your goal…which is, again, a matter of personal accountability. The layers of accountability Once you have your goal and a strategic plan to achieve it, consider adding in what productivity experts Carey and Demir Bentley call the “ four layers of accountability ”: a coach, team, and an accountability buddy, and public accountability . Each “layer” is an external force – whether it’s a boss, friend, or community – that helps hold you to your strategic plan. A coach is a mentor, boss, or expert who holds you to a higher standard than you may be accustomed to holding for yourself. Tell your coach about your goal and plan, and ask them to check in with you along the way. Creating a team provides accountability because working with others requires you to deliver on your promises. If you work in a corporate setting, work with a team member more closely than usual to finish a challenging project. You could also pair up with an accountability buddy , and have regular check-ins to assess progress and challenges. Team up with someone who you trust to give constructive, honest feedback. Last, consider publicly announcing your goal so that if you don’t reach it, there’s a social consequence. You can post your goal in a business-minded social media group or forum, or in an email to your friends and family. Announcing your goal to others puts you on the hook to execute. However, accountability still comes down to you doing what you promise to do. Don’t blame any of these “layers” if you don’t follow through. Being accountable is a craft that takes practice. Develop your goal-setting and execution skills, and know that they’ll strengthen with time.", "date": "2017-09-29,"},

The old Evernote podcast had a good run (from 2009 to 2013, with a couple of special installments after that), and we were sad to see it go. We’ve wanted to revive the podcast for a while now, so when we began talking about New Year’s resolutions here at Evernote HQ, it seemed only natural to add it to our content team’s goals for 2017. Starting on a high note We’re proud to introduce Taking Note , a new interview-based series where we’ll talk with movers and shakers in the realms of productivity, entrepreneurship, and creative thinking. Listen now: http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-1-Michael-Hyatt.mp3 Length: 26 mins iTunes | SoundCloud | Google Play | MP3 | RSS For our first episode, we wanted to talk about how to make resolutions work for you. How do we harness the good intentions and energy of a fresh start and turn that into concrete results that last? How do we conquer our fears and empower ourselves to reach our goals? For questions like that, there’s no better person to turn than to Michael Hyatt . As a leadership development mentor, Michael helps high achievers get the clarity, confidence, and tools they need to win at work and succeed at life. It’s a message that resonates with hundreds of thousands of people who follow Michael on social media, visit his blog, take one of his courses, or attend one of his speaking engagements. His podcast, “This Is Your Life,” has run for more than 200 episodes. And his recent book, Living Forward: A Proven Plan to Stop Drifting and Get the Life You Want , is a Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestseller. Michael has also been a champion of Evernote for years (check out his excellent blog post describing his tag-based organizational system, or his guest posts on the Evernote Blog), and he has plenty to say about the role Evernote can play in a developing a plan for achieving your goals. Michael Hyatt spoke to us from his home base in Nashville, Tennessee. A partial transcript is below. To hear the complete interview and catch our future episodes, head over to iTunes , SoundCloud , or Google Play . Okay, it’s the start of a new year. People are thinking about recalibrating, about making life changes. Of course, we are all pretty good usually about knowing when we’re not happy, or when we want to change something. Not so good, perhaps, when it comes time to figuring out how to take action on that or where to start. How do we know that we’re choosing the right goals? I could list about 50 things I’d like to change in the coming year. I think first of all, I would not set goals inside what the authors of The Four Disciplines of Execution call “the whirlwind,” just your normal job. You’re going to have goals there anyway. There’s a difference between projects and goals. Every goal is a project, but not every project is a goal. There’s going to be hundreds of things you’re going to attempt this year and going to have to do for work or in your private life, but goals are really outside of the whirlwind. These are the things that would really move the needle and create for you a remarkable year. Only you can answer that question. What would it be? What would be the extraordinary thing that you could accomplish in your career or in your business, or your marriage, or your health that looking back on it once you get to December 31st, 2017, what would make this year extraordinary? One of the things that we’ve discovered in all the research we’ve done about goals is that when people try too many, they get overwhelmed. You talked about a list of 10, 20, 50 goals. People have a lot of things they want to accomplish when they think about self-improvement, but the multiplicity of goals actually works against you because it divides your focus. There’s an ancient Chinese proverb that I love that says, “Man who chases two rabbits catches neither.” If we divide our focus over too many goals, then we really run the risk of sabotaging real progress. We’ve got to narrow the focus and really lock in, and this takes priorities, on seven to no more than ten goals that we’re going to shoot for for the entire year. Even those, the deadlines need to be staggered through the year so that we’re not trying to do too much at once. That’s a great point. When we’re thinking about productivity, we often think in terms of just getting more done, piling more onto the plate. It’s not really about that, is it? It really isn’t. It’s really about getting the right things done, not about getting more things done. This past year, I published an online course called Free to Focus , and the subtitle really says it all about my philosophy. It’s, “Achieve more by doing less.” Now how in the world do you do that? How do you cut the number of tasks down so that you only have a few? My basic rule is that I only have three tasks on any one day. They’re important tasks. They might even be urgent, but there’s only three tasks. To do that, you’ve really got to know what your unique ability is, or you need to focus. I think I first read this in Tim Ferriss’s The Four Hour Work Week . You’ve got to be able to eliminate, automate, and then delegate in order to get the things off your plate that you shouldn’t be touching at all. The problem with drifting is that nobody ever drifted to a destination they would’ve chosen. If you’re doing three really important things every day, those things start to add up and really move the needle in your life whereas most people set out with this giant to-do list every day. They go to bed at the end of the day frustrated that they didn’t get it all done. They wake up in the morning dreading what they’ve still got to do that was hanging over from yesterday, and they don’t feel like they’re winning. They don’t feel like they’re making any progress. That’s just a game you can’t win. Why not design a game you can win? How do we go about doing that? I hear three tasks per day, seven to ten goals for the year, so we’re thinking in terms of layers. How do you go about narrowing that list down and coming up with some sort of a realistic, achievable plan? I think it starts with clarity about what it is that you want for you life. Most people don’t take time or pause long enough to really think about what it is that they want. They’re fuzzy. They’re just kind of drifting through life, and the problem with drifting is that nobody ever drifted to a destination they would’ve chosen. That takes intentionality. I’ve got a little model that I use in my courses and in some online assessments that I have where we talk about the Three Circles of Life. The Circle of Being which includes your spiritual life, your intellectual life, your emotional life, your physical life. That’s you in relationship to yourself. What do you want in those areas? You, as a private person. Then there’s the Circle of Relating, which is you in relationship to your spouse or your significant other. Maybe your children, your friends, your social network. That’s you in relationship to others. What do you want there? Are there friendships that you need? Do you have friends outside of work? Is your marriage or your relationship with a significant other at a place where you’re really happy and satisfied and deeply connected, or do you want something different? Then there’s the Circle of Doing, which would include your vocation, your advocation or hobbies, and then your finances. In all these areas, I think one of the things we have to get clear on is what do we want. What do we want out of our marriage? What do we want out of our career? What do we want out of our finances? What do we want out of our intellectual life? When we write, we get clear. When we get clear, that acts like a magnet that pulls us toward it. Articulate that by writing it down. This is a huge mistake that people make. They have these vague aspirations, these dreams, but they’re not written down. There was a researcher at Dominican University in California who did a research project on 267 participants on goal setting. One of the findings that she had among others was that just by writing your goal down, you’re 42% more likely to achieve it if nothing else happens. When we write, we get clear. When we get clear, that acts like a magnet that pulls us toward it. Of course, a lot of us need some help in reaching that point. Did you have a mentor or someone that helped you attain clarity? Yeah, I’ve had quite a few through the years. One of the most significant ones, I hired an executive coach in the year 2000. Daniel Harkavy. In fact, he’s the co-author of my most recent book, Living Forward . He was a huge help to me because he was the first person that actually said, “You need to think about what you want in each of the major domains in your life.” We went through a process which we write about in the book, a life-planning process where we get clear in each one of these areas and think about where do we want to be in 25 years. Let’s talk about the book for a moment. Living Forward: A Proving Plan to Stop Drifting and Get the Life You Want. How did that book come about? Well, I’ve been involved in life planning with Daniel since about 2000. I’ve done it every year, and it’s just been a hugely helpful, clarifying exercise. At one point, I said to Daniel, “You know, this process has been so helpful to me, and I’ve just been somebody who’s been on the receiving end of practicing it. You’ve been on the coaching end of it coaching thousands of people how to do it. What about if we get together and do a book that would help people go through the process?” He loved the idea, and so we wrote the book. We launched it this last spring. It’s a Wall Street Journal , USA Today , Publisher’s Weekly bestseller. Evidently, a lot of people feel the need for life planning or to think more intentionally about their life. That’s just one of many projects you have. You’ve also got a weekly podcast called “This is Your Life,” and you’ve got an online course which I think is very relevant to this time of the year. Is that right? Yeah, I do. I’ve got a course called Five Days to Your Best Year Ever . This was launched about four years ago, and it came out of a practice that I began more than a decade ago where I took the period between Christmas and New Years and thought through what I wanted for the next year. I always ask myself the question, “How can I make this next year the best year ever?” At one point my daughter Megan, who is the COO of my business, she came to me and said, “Dad, I really think we should create a course around that.” I said, “What? Really?” I kind of almost thought that everybody does this. Everybody takes that time to reflect. She said, “Look, almost nobody does this. I think the process that you use could be hugely helpful in helping people get clear about what they want and making their year an extraordinary year.” You know, it’s funny. It seems so obvious that you would take a few days at the start of the year if you wanted to make some sort of major change throughout that year, that you would take a few days to plan that out, but it’s true. Most of us don’t take that time. I’m not going to ask you to compress five days into the next few minutes, but if we could talk a little bit about some of the brass-tacks actions that do need to be taken… Sure. Having a goal, having intentionality, having clarity. That all makes a lot of sense, but that might not be enough if we can’t actually turn that into new behaviors and new habits. What’s your advice for actually changing patterns of behavior? One of the things I talk about in the first session of Five Days to Your Best Year Ever is the importance of identifying your limiting beliefs. I think a lot of times, it’s our beliefs that hold us back. They keep us from behaving in a certain way because we think maybe that we’re too old or that we’re too young, or we don’t have enough experience, have enough education. The problem is is that limiting beliefs are typically in our head. They don’t exist out there, although we tend to externalize them. That very first session of Best Year Ever , we boil that down and try to identify those limiting beliefs and replace them with liberating truths. In session two, we talk about completing the past. So many people drag the worst of the past into the best of their future, and they sabotage themselves because they’ve got something they haven’t completed in the past. We go through an eight-step process where we talk about completing the past. Not just the negative things and processing our regrets and disappointments from the last year, but also celebrating our wins. Talking about the things we wished we’d been acknowledged for but weren’t. Those items that we were the most proud of so that we can be in our strongest possible position when we begin to set goals which happens in session three. I do use the SMART framework, but I’ve expanded it to the SMARTER framework. The two pieces that I add onto the end of the SMART framework which most people are familiar with is that the goal’s got to be exciting. That’s the E. It’s got to be something that’s really compelling to you because if it’s not compelling, you’re probably not going to follow through. You’re going to lose steam when the going gets tough. Then, it needs to be relevant. By relevant, I mean it needs to align with the rest of your life. Somebody that’s a mom of small children is in a very different season than somebody like me who basically is an empty nester. I’ve got more discretionary time than somebody in that situation, so the goals need to reflect that. Then we talk about connecting with your “why” on session four. Hugely important. Why is this goal important? Actually writing those things down. By the way, I do this in Evernote. Then, fifth is how do you make it all happen? This is all about execution, and how do you actually make the changes. You mentioned the SMART framework. Just in case people aren’t familiar with that, that’s an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-based. Is that correct? Well, people have different words for that but mine is Specific , Measurable , Actionable , Risky —this is a key idea here—and then finally Time-keyed . Risky . Most people set their goals too low. Sometimes people translate the R into Realistic. Actually, that’s the worst thing you could possibly do if you want to follow through on a goal. All the research shows this. If you want to follow through on a goal, it needs to be harder, not easier. A goal that’s easy won’t command your attention. You need for it to be in your discomfort zone. Now this is important because there’s three zones. A goal that’s easy won’t command your attention. You need for it to be in your discomfort zone. The first zone is your comfort zone. That’s where you do email, that’s where you go to meetings, that’s where you shop for groceries, just all the basic stuff of life. It’s the comfort zone. Nothing hard about it. It’s forgettable. You don’t need a goal that’s in the comfort zone. The discomfort zone is when you begin to feel a little bit of fear, a little bit of uncertainty, a little bit of doubt. Those negative emotions are actually positive indicators that you’re on the right path, that this is something where you’re going to get a breakthrough result. Something where you’re going to experience something extraordinary. All the good stuff happens in the discomfort zone, but it’s not zone three and you want to stay out of this one too. This is the delusional zone. This is where you set the goals so high that there’s no way that you could possibly accomplish it, or no way that you could accomplish it without sacrificing all the other areas of your life. For me, for example, if I decided I wanted to play golf on the PGA professional tour, that would be delusional. I don’t want to do that; I want to go right to the door of delusional and dial it back a few clicks to where it’s just uncomfortable. When we talk about making goals risky and getting into our discomfort zone, that raises a couple of questions. How do we keep ourselves accountable? Also, what happens if we fail? Yeah, two great questions. First of all, accountability’s critically important. I cited the research earlier from Dr. Gail Matthews at Dominican University about the 42% better chance of achieving your goals if you write them down. The other major factor that she found is accountability. That when people are accountable to somebody else for their results, they’re much much more likely, about twice as likely to follow through. You’ve got to be careful here. Derek Sivers has this great TED Talk where he talks about the fact that when you share your goals publicly, then you have the same psychological benefit of actually achieving the goal so it actually works against you. You get the same satisfaction. He suggests you don’t share it with anybody. What I recommend and what we teach in the course is selective sharing. In other words, you want to share the goals with a few people that could hold you accountable, that could be supportive, that can be a resource when you get stuck. That’s the key: have an accountability partner or an accountability group that you know they’re in there with you and they’re trying to work for improvement just like you are. What if we fail? Well, I got this from John Maxwell, another one of my mentors. He says, “There’s no failure; there’s only feedback.” Whenever we fail, it’s okay. Failure’s kind of overrated. One of the best ways to make progress is to fail and to fail fast. If we can look at fail and not internalize it so that it affects our identity so that we say, “I’m a failure,” if we could just say, “Yeah, I failed at that. Now what’s the learning from that?” We go through a process in Best Year Ever called the After-Action Review where we’re able to process that, squeeze the juice out of it, and use it for learning so that we can pick ourselves up and actually improve what we do. Failure’s kind of overrated. One of the best ways to make progress is to fail and to fail fast. Another piece of research that we stumbled across this past year is that your areas of failure or your areas of disappointment or regret, it’s called the Opportunity Principle, are usually indicators of your greatest opportunity for growth in the next year. Those areas where you fail, if you could just reframe it and see it as an opportunity, that can be an area where you can experience substantial progress because you’ve already figured out some things that don’t work. That all makes a lot of sense, and it all ties back into the things you were saying earlier about learning from the past and not letting your previous experiences turn into limiting beliefs. I want to talk a bit about system before we wrap up. We’ve mentioned the importance of writing things down. I should mention you’ve also written some excellent posts on your website about how you use Evernote. I’d like to know how you use it as part of a system and something that you can use throughout the day, throughout the year. Part of what I do with reference to goals is that I have basically a goal template in Evernote that I export as a template, and then I use it for each one of my goals. I state the goal, I identify my key motivations, I put my next actions, any kind of inspiring thoughts. I use one of those for each of my seven to ten goals for the year. This year, I happen to have nine so I’ll have nine of these separate notes in Evernote. Then I take the table of contents function . This is something I discovered last year. I cannot believe that I somehow missed this in the past. I basically create a note that has all of those nine other notes referenced with a link to each one. Now here’s the cool thing: I drag that note as a shortcut to my sidebar, and that’s what I review every morning. I don’t do a deep dive, but I’m just reviewing those nine goals each morning, just the statements. Got a link if I want to go deeper, but just the statement of my nine goals. What I’m looking for is maybe a task that I can put on my task list today that would advance me in the direction of one of my goals. Every morning, that’s my process. Then once a week during my weekly review, I pull up that same note again as a shortcut on my sidebar, and now I click into the links and I review a deeper dive on each one of those, particularly I’m looking into key motivations. I want to connect with those intellectually and emotionally just to remind me about why that’s important, and that’s why it’s on my goal list for this year. The people that really achieve great big results aren’t smarter than you. They’re not more educated, they’re not more experienced. They’re people that have clarity and people that have courage. All right. We’ve talked a lot about motivation. What’s your motivation? What gets you out of bed in the morning? I think to make a difference. I love nothing more than helping people realize their potential. When I’m talking to people, when I’m coaching, when I’m teaching, whatever, I just think to myself, “You have no idea how much potential you have.” The people that really achieve great big results aren’t smarter than you. They’re not more educated, they’re not more experienced. They’re people usually that have clarity and people that have courage. By courage, I don’t mean that they don’t have fear, but they’re willing to do it scared even when they experience fear. That’s the only difference. People can accomplish an enormous amount if they’re willing to work to get clarity, and if they’re willing to be brave and do it scared.

Thanks for the great response to Episode 1 , in which we talked about goals and resolutions with leadership mentor Michael Hyatt. We received a lot of positive feedback, including some programming suggestions we hope to implement for future episodes. For Episode 2, we begin with a roundup of company news, including first-person reports on Evernote’s recent financial milestone , the successful move of our data infrastructure to the cloud, and the new design of our iOS app . Listen now: http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-2-Guy-Kawasaki.mp3 Length: 39 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Google Play | MP3 | RSS For our main feature, we reached out to superstar tech evangelist Guy Kawasaki and got a personal response in less than two minutes — an early indicator of what proved to be the core of our conversation. Guy first came to prominence in the 1980s as Chief Evangelist at Apple, and today he juggles a lot of roles, from his work for design company Canva to brand ambassadorships, advising corporations, and his constant presence on social media. How does he stay on top of it all? The answer, we found, is Guy’s “always-on” attitude and his ceaseless drive to connect. Some highlights of our conversation with Guy are transcribed below. To hear the complete interview and catch future episodes of “Taking Note,” head over to iTunes , SoundCloud , or Google Play . You’ve got so many irons in so many fires. How do you manage it all? I am constantly working. I think there are people who are much smarter than me, I think there are people who work harder than me, but not too many people are smarter and work harder than me. The secret to my success is the willingness — if not the sheer enjoyment — of grinding it out. That’s why I’ve succeeded. It’s not because of brilliance or anything like that. The bulk of my outward focus is public speaking, about innovation, entrepreneurship, enchantment. I work hard but I’m affiliated with great stuff. Canva is gold. It is a fantastic service. Mercedes-Benz is fantastic. How hard could it be? How do you put structure around all that? You assume I do put structure around that. What determines the structure of my day is when, where, how, how often, how long I have to drive my kids around. On a light day, I work more. On a heavy day, I work less. My typical schedule is I get up at 7:00, I take one of my kids to school, I go to a restaurant, I answer e-mail and do social media. I may have a mid-morning meeting. After that, I go and play hockey. After I play hockey, I eat lunch. While I’m eating lunch, guess what I’m doing? E-mail and social media. Then, I pick up a kid or two. I come home: e-mail and social media. Eat dinner: e-mail and social media. There’s definitely a pattern there. Yes, yes. It’s Groundhog Day. Over and over in a cycle. It does give you structure and that rhythm that carries you through the day. You’ve mentioned that Evernote is a part of your flow. Is there any particular way that you use it? I send, basically, every travel confirmation to two places: TripIt and Evernote. I could not survive without both of them. Every time I buy a piece of software, anytime I buy anything, I send the receipt or the confirmation or the unlocking code to Evernote. I know it’s in Gmail someplace but somehow, if you buy a piece of software called XYZ but it’s made by ABC company and you’re searching for XYZ, I mean it’s just good that Evernote will find ABC and XYZ. You do a lot of travel as you mentioned. What does that do to your routine? The way I travel is I take the second to the last flight out every day because I can’t take a chance that flying on the last flight. If it’s canceled then I’m screwed ’til the next morning. I get to a city, I go to the hotel, I try to sleep, I wake up, I speak, I leave. While I’m on the airplane, I’m answering e-mail and doing social media. We’re seeing a trend here. I’m always doing e-mail and social media. That’s my life. That’s all very tactical. It’s not the last flight, it’s the second to the last flight. Is that the hallmark of your style? It is the hallmark of my style because I’m a tactical and practical person. That’s what’s necessary for my kind of existence. I can’t tell you that I sit around gazing into my bellybutton considering future trends or all that. I’m not a visionary, I’m not a futurist. I just do battle. I’m not a visionary. I’m not a futurist. I just do battle. Democratization is a theme that seems to run throughout your work. You’ve championed democratization of computing at Apple, democratization of design at Canva, the dissemination of knowledge through Wikimedia Foundation and self-publishing. Now, I know you said you’re not a futurist, you’re not a visionary, but is this the mega-trend of the 21st Century? Is it democratization? That’s what I stand for. I have a personal mantra for my life which is to empower people and I want to empower people through my work of writing, speaking, investing, advising, whatever it takes. You talked earlier about how your whole day runs through this Groundhog Day cycle. The line between our personal lives and our work lives is blurring… Is that a good thing? I mean, it’s working for you. Is that a good thing for society do you think? I’d say who am I to judge that? It works for me, I think, and it may not work for others but you could say that about a lot of factors in people’s lives. I figured out a path. I’m not saying it’s the only path, I’m not saying it’s the best path, but it’s a path that works for me. What can I say? Evernote is part of this path because I have a lot of information and I have a very bad and getting worse memory. Don’t we all? Incidentally, I have to say that this new iOS app is really good. Evernote is now on the first page of my iOS phone and that happened because of this upgrade. You’re a very prolific sharer, you were an early and enthusiastic social media adapter. How important is it to you? I’m not doing it for fun. Social media, for me, is a means to an end. That end is to empower people and there’s also, honestly, another end which is to promote Canva, promote Mercedes-Benz, promote my book, promote whatever. It is a means to an end. I’m not looking for more friends. I have all the friends I can handle. I read an article the other day that the maximum number of friends you can handle is 150. I’m not sure it’s that high. Having said that, I don’t use it strictly to promote. I believe that the way social media is optimized is that you have to earn the right to promote. So the question becomes how do you earn the right to promote on social media? The answer to that is you provide value. You have to earn the right to promote. There are two examples in the world of earning the right to promote. Example number one is NPR. NPR provides great content every day of the year. A few days a year, it runs the pledge drive. The pledge drive works. Why does the pledge drive work? Why do we even tolerate the pledge drive? It’s because we feel a sense of obligation to NPR. They’ve provided great content so we should donate, we should pay them back. Similar with Wikipedia. Wikipedia provides great information and every once in a while, there’s a banner, there’s an e-mail from Jimmy Wales saying “donate” and we do. Why is that? Because Wikipedia has earned that right to promote. My whole equation, my whole philosophy on social media is to earn the right — by giving value — to promote. That’s true of any business. I mean, you don’t give somebody money just because they say, “give me money.” You give them money because they’ve given you something that is worthwhile; they’ve changed your life, your day, your working style. Right. Not every company has internalized that theory, shall I say? Now, sharing on social media, it’s also a form of writing and writing and public speaking, these are things you do a lot. You’ve written 13 books. You were, in a previous life, a columnist. How do you make time to write? That is the hardest thing in the world. This is where people should not follow my example. I know how one should do it. One should get up in the morning and do your writing and then do your e-mail and social media. I read Lifehacker. I know how to do this, I just don’t do it. What happens, for me, is I wake up in the morning and I say today is the day you’re going to write. But first I got to check e-mail, there might be an emergency. Then, I have to check social media, there might be an emergency. Okay, you get the pattern. It’s partly my personality; like I’m all-in or I’m not at all. I know people who play golf once or twice a year, that would never be me. I’m all in and when I’m all in, I am all in.

Giving it, receiving it, absorbing it, acting on it — all of these things require openness and a willingness to communicate honestly. But whether we’re talking about our personal relationships, our professional lives, or society itself, dealing with feedback is essential if we want to meet our goals, grow, and improve. In Episode 3 of our new podcast , we look at feedback in two forms. First, we chat with Gerald Hastie, Evernote’s Director of Customer Experience, to learn more about how Evernote’s customer support and Help Center are working to address feedback from the public. Then we sit down with Kim Scott , author of the new book Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss without Losing your Humanity , to learn how building a culture of candor at work can help us all become more effective in whatever we do. Listen now: http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-3-Kim-Scott.mp3 Length: 40 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Google Play | MP3 | RSS Highlights of our conversation with Kim Scott are transcribed below. To hear the complete interview and subscribe to future episodes of “Taking Note,” head over to iTunes , SoundCloud , or Google Play . You’ve talked about the universality of some of the issues that you see [working with CEOs]. What are some of the things that come up most frequently? I think one of the things that people struggle with most is how to create a culture of feedback. Part of the problem is that you know as a manager that you’re supposed to give feedback. That’s very nerve-wracking, for two reasons. From the time most of us learn to speak, we had one or two parents who told us some version of “if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it at all.” We’ve been trained since we were 18 months old not to give feedback and now all of a sudden it’s your job to do it. We’ve been trained since we were 18 months old not to give feedback and now all of a sudden it’s your job to do it. I think the other part of the problem is that around the time we’re 18 years old, we get told be “professional.” For too many people that gets translated to mean leave all of your vulnerabilities, leave all of your emotions, leave your humanity, the very best part of yourself, at home and come to work like some kind of robot. Both of those factors combine to make giving feedback really hard. They also combine to make leaders forget that they’re actually supposed to solicit it before they start giving it. Don’t dish it out until you prove you can take it. I know your work with Sheryl Sandberg, when she was with Google, was key to the development of your approach and your thinking in these terms. What’s the story there? Shortly after I joined Google, I had to give a presentation to the CEO and the founders about the AdSense business. When I walked into the presentation, I felt a little nervous like any normal person would in that situation. The good news, however, was that the business was on fire. When I said how many new customers we had added over the last month or so, Eric Schmidt, the CEO, sort of jerked his head up out of his computer and said, “What did you say? What resources do you need to keep this business miracle alive? Do you need more engineers? Do you need marketing dollars?” I felt like the meeting had gone pretty well. In fact, I felt like a genius. As I was leaving the meeting, I passed by Sheryl Sandberg, my boss, and I was expecting a high-five or some sort of congrats. Instead, she said, “Why don’t you walk back to my office with me?” I thought, oh boy, I did something wrong. I’m sure I’m about to hear about it. The really good news was that there was a lot of good news. Sheryl started with that. But, she said eventually, “You know, you said ‘um’ a lot in there. Were you aware of it?” At this point, I breathed a huge sigh of relief and I made a brush off gesture with my hand. I said, “I know; it’s a verbal tic, it’s no big deal.” Sheryl said, “I know a really good speech coach and Google would pay for it. Would you like an introduction?” I made the brush off gesture with my hand again. I said, “No, I’m busy. Didn’t you hear about all these new customers?” At this point, Sheryl stopped in her tracks and she looked me in the eye and she said, “I’m going have to be a lot more direct with you. When you say ‘um’ every third word, it makes you sound stupid.” Now, a lot of people would have said that it was mean of Sheryl to say that I sounded stupid, but in fact, it was the very kindest thing she could have done for me. It was what she had to do in order to get through to me. The reason why it was such a kindness was that when I went to see the speech coach, I learned that she really wasn’t exaggerating. I literally did say ‘um’ every third word. The thing that struck me in that moment was that nobody had told me that I had this problem. It was like I had been going through my whole career with a giant hunk of spinach between my teeth and nobody had had the courtesy to tell me about it. Once Sheryl told me about it, I could fix it. Now we’re getting into the concept of Radical Candor, that notion of caring personally and challenging directly. We hear a lot of talk about constructive criticism, but ‘constructive’ is a very cold word. I think when you talk about caring personally, that makes it a bit more immediate. Is there a difference between constructive criticism and Radical Candor? Yes. I’m really glad you raised the question of constructive criticism because it’s a bugaboo of mine. One of the problems with the term ‘constructive criticism’ is that it implies that you can control how the other person reacts to what you say. There’s a big difference between Radical Candor and obnoxious aggression. The big difference between Radical Candor and constructive criticism is that Radical Candor, first of all, applies to both praise and criticism, and caring personally is about acknowledging the other person as an independent human being. If they do get upset, it’s about reacting to that upset with compassion, not imagining that if you just found the right words they wouldn’t get upset. Again, Radical Candor is caring personally and challenging directly at the same time. There’s a big difference between Radical Candor and obnoxious aggression. There’s a very simple and direct visualization of this that you use a lot where Radical Candor is one quadrant of a graph. Could you walk us through those four quadrants? It explains what happens when you have both the caring personally and challenging directly when you lack one or the other and when you have neither. When you care personally and challenge directly, that’s Radical Candor. When you challenge directly but fail to show that you care personally, that’s obnoxious aggression. When you care personally but you fail to challenge directly, that’s ruinous empathy, and when you fail on both dimensions, which we all do from time to time, it’s what I call manipulative insincerity. When we get so busy or so stressed or so reactive that we fail to show that we care personally and don’t bother to challenge directly, that’s where really insidious behavior, political behavior, office politics comes in, passive aggressive behavior. These are strong words: “ruinous” and “obnoxious” and “manipulative,” but you’re not kidding. There are real imp lications to failing to achieve Radical Candor, right? What are some of the things that happen to organizations which miss the mark? The most common mistake that I see made in organizations is ruinous empathy where people really do care about one another; they don’t want to hurt each other’s feelings. Therefore, when somebody makes a mistake, when work isn’t nearly good enough, they fail to say so. Also, when they offer praise to people, they offer praise in a way that is aimed at bolstering their ego or just making them feel better as opposed to showing what was really genuinely great. In those cultures of ruinous empathy, people don’t do the best work of their lives. It’s impossible for a person to see in the moment when they’re making a mistake. We rely on each other to show us when we’re making a mistake. When we don’t provide that service to one another, then we don’t do our best work. It’s a shame. It’s a lost opportunity. Part of the reason why I named each of these quadrants so flamboyantly is to provide a really strong warning about what happens. You don’t want to ruin your people. I think one of the things that I have found in my coaching that really helps people is to think of your [own] story. What’s a time in your career when you had a boss who told you something that really helped you improve? It’s not just about dealing with problems; it’s about preventing problems. I can see how there could be implications in this, not just in terms of how people are performing but also how a team works together, their productivity or their creativity or their happiness in the workplace. Is that true? Absolutely. When a team of people feels that they can’t tell each other when something’s going wrong, that they can’t say this pixel is not right or this presentation is not right or your idea doesn’t feel quite right, when they repress all that, meetings start to feel like getting stuck in traffic. There’s the meeting before the meeting and the meeting after the meeting. When problems don’t get fixed, life is depressing. Let’s make new mistakes. Let’s really try to make things better. Let’s fix the old mistakes and make new ones together. I think that’s also when we start to see offices devolve into politics and passive-aggressive situations. It’s also important to realize very often what happens in office situations or just in any human relationship, really, is somebody will cross the line and be a jerk and then the advice that they get is instead of moving up on the “care personally” dimension, they just back off their challenge. This happens all the time, the false apology. It’s happened to me. I’m sure it’s happened to you. It seems safer just to remain silent, but it’s not safe. It’s depressing. If you can force yourself not to back off your challenge when you realize you’ve been a jerk, but instead to react with compassion to the other person’s emotions, then I think we can avoid the passive-aggressive kind of behavior. It seems safer just to remain silent, but it’s not safe. It’s depressing. Do you find anyone takes to this naturally? Are there certain personality types that are more responsive to it? I think that for the vast majority of people it’s hard. It’s definitely hard. It’s tempting to say that some cultures are naturally Radically Candid. Certainly, Radical Candor looks very different in Tel Aviv than it does in Tokyo. Sometimes people think that it’s harder if you come from a polite culture. Often when I’ll talk to a team of Brits they’ll say, “It’s much harder for us,” but in fact, I don’t find that to be the case. I think that everybody struggles to find the right way to say something to another person. I’m also curious if there are any special considerations or nuances to the concept when you’re dealing with female leaders. So many people now still have to deal with this double-standard where being forthright and blunt might be considered a positive trait in a male manager and a negative trait in a female manager. It’s hard to be Radically Candid with someone who looks like you. It’s even harder to be Radically Candid with someone who doesn’t look like you regardless of what the dimensions of that not looking like you are. Specifically to the topic of gender, I think if you’re a male boss and you have female direct reports, there’s a good chance that you have a tendency to pull your punches with the women on your team in a way you don’t with the men, to give less feedback or gentler feedback. It’s not because of some sort of deep-seated terrible misogyny. It’s because you want to be a nice guy and you want to be supportive of the women. Just remembering that you need to give women the same kind of feedback that you give the men on your team is really, really helpful. Now, if you’re a woman and you’re being Radically Candid, you’re much more likely to get unjustly accused of obnoxious aggression. This is the “abrasive” problem. This is the “bossy” problem. This is when the name-calling starts. Here’s my advice on that. First of all, it’s important to just recognize it for what it is. There’s a time and a place to reject that feedback. Just put on your tough suit and continue to show that you care personally, but whatever you do, don’t back off your willingness to challenge directly. Because even if you get accused of obnoxious aggression unfairly, that’s actually a better place to be than ruinous empathy or manipulative insincerity, which is where you’re going to wind up if you back off that challenge. Move up on the “care personally” axis but don’t back off your willingness to challenge directly. Also, a word of caution on the caring personally thing. Often women wind up getting asked to do the office housework. There’s a great essay that Virginia Woolf wrote called “The Angel in the House.” She was referring to this Victorian poem about how women have no wants or needs of their own but just there to support the men. It’s a ridiculous poem. Unfortunately what happens sometimes is that women are expected to be the angel in the office. You’ll burn out and be really pissed off if you get sucked into that path. You want to show you care personally, but don’t get sucked into becoming the angel in the office. This is obviously a management concept. But as we talk, this sounds very much like something that isn’t just top-down but something that an entire team might want to adopt or even that might go the opposite way, might go from bottom up. I hate hierarchical language — but it’s got to go up, down and sideways. The first step is to ask for criticism. Not just ask for criticism but demand criticism. As hard as it is to give criticism, it’s also awkward to ask for it. The first step is to ask for criticism. Not just ask for criticism but demand criticism. Then paradoxically you have to embrace the discomfort. It’s awkward for the other person and it’s tempting for them to just say everything’s fine. You’ve got to actually make it more uncomfortable for the person to tell you nothing than to tell you something. Then you’ve got to listen to what is said with the intent to understand it, not to respond, not to get defensive. You’ve really got to manage that tendency to get defensive. Then finally, you’ve got to reward the truth. If somebody points out a problem and you agree it’s a problem, fix it. Tell them that you fixed it. If you disagree that it’s a problem, find whatever that nugget of what they said that you can agree with and then come back to them a couple of days later when you’re definitely calmer, cooler and not defensive and explain. That all makes a lot of sense. [Radical Candor] sounds difficult, but it all makes a lot of sense. It sounds hard but when you start doing it and seeing the results, it’ll start to feel like exercising regularly. It’ll be hard not to do it. You’ll feel gross. It’ll be like brushing your teeth. You’ll feel gross when you don’t do it.

For Episode 4, we get down to some core principles. Listen now: http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-4-Kristina-Halvorson.mp3 Length: 38 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Google Play | MP3 | RSS Whether we’re talking about our personal lives or our work, real progress requires us to ask some difficult questions: What do we want? What’s it all about? Beat Bühlmann, head of Evernote’s office in Zürich, Switzerland, challenges us to do just that with his “ Swiss PDP Approach ” to personal development. Beat’s system, refined over ten years, goes beyond standard ideas of work/life balance to get to the center of who we are as individuals. “It’s like building a house,” he says. “You cannot start with the roof. You have to start with the foundation, and in terms of development, the foundation is you. Who are you? What are your values?” For content strategist Kristina Halvorson , asking big questions at the beginning is also the key to success. As one of the leading voices in the content field for nearly a decade, she’s seen companies from tech giants to dog food producers succeed or fail online as a result of how well they understand their customers and how well the content of their websites meets real needs. About her company, Brain Traffic , she says: “99 out of 100 people that we talk to, they don’t know what their audiences want to do on their website. It’s shocking. Because if you just dive into ‘what do we want people to do on our site?’ you are going at it backward.” Highlights of our conversation with Kristina Halvorson are transcribed below. To hear the complete interview and subscribe to future episodes of “Taking Note,” head over to iTunes , SoundCloud , or Google Play . What is content strategy? This question. If I never had to answer this question again I would be so happy. My definition has been evolving along with everybody else’s. And I just, I hate answering the question because I feel like there are a lot of different answers and none of them are necessarily right or wrong. The way that we talk about content strategy when a client comes to us, basically they come to us with problems: “Our content is a disaster.” Or, “We are launching a project with a new website and we want to do it right. We want to think about the content, we don’t want to necessarily start with the mood boards or whatever.” So the way that we frame it up is: we are going to work with you to identify business goals that the website can have an impact on. We are going to work with you to identify what—and I am getting to the definition, I promise!—what your users want to do and find out once they hit your website. And so when I’m talking about content strategy 90% of the time I am talking about website content strategy and that is the strategic framework that guides planning for the creation, the structure, and the ongoing maintenance of content that your audience cares about, wants, and needs. A lot of people conflate the concepts of content strategy and content marketing. And a lot of us are asked to do both, wear both of those hats. Content marketing as I see it is more about the application of the content strategy, whereas the content strategy might be about asking those deep questions. What do we do and why? And how do we structure it and maintain it, as you said? But then the marketing is more about, okay if we know what it is that we do and why and how we manage it, what do we do with that? Oh for sure and you know I have done battle with content marketing for years because I felt like it was taking us so many steps backward. Because the call, the siren call of content marketing was ‘get content and you’ll get customers.’ More content equals more eyeballs and builds trust and engagement. And so what I saw—what I think a lot of us saw—were just companies going “Yes, content” and syndicating and churning out all this crap that nobody cared about. And their websites would remain broken. And that’s where people wanted to actually interact with them and get stuff done. And it made me nuts to be called in to a dog food company or a plumbing company and these people like “We’re going to double down on content for our marketing.” And again it would just come back to, how do you know that this is what people want or need? Have you talked to them? How can you differentiate from your competitors in the field or are you just trying to keep up with the Joneses? Then that rolled back to these strategy questions. Where do you think is the best place for somebody who just wants to start? Where do you go? You go to your users. I own a little company called Brain Traffic. And we are small, there’s only 10 of us. Which is great because we get to be a little picky about the projects that come our way, but 99 out of 100 people that we talk to, they don’t know what their audiences want to do on their website. It’s shocking. One of my big career gurus, Gerry McGovern , has been yelling about this and tearing his hair out about this literally since 1994. He still writes blog posts about this every Sunday. Same topic. So if you want to start somewhere, take a breath and talk to your users. Go read Louis Rosenfeld’s book Search Analytics for Your Site , find out what people are searching for, go talk to Gerry McGovern and get his Top Tasks methodology. Because if you just dive into—and I see this over and over and over again— what do we want people to do on our site? You are going at it backward. If you put your user first, your business is going to be successful. You’ve got to understand—I clearly have a few feelings about this—you’ve got to understand first of all, what you want your website to accomplish for your business and then you’ve got to understand your user expectation and needs. And you know that is a basic tenet of user experience design. If you put your user first, your business is going to be successful. So being able to consider that, marry those, synthesize that information, and then make decisions about content priorities, information architecture, content requirements, voice and tone, all of that stuff. You don’t want to do any of that until you’ve got those key things in place. You also founded the Confab content strategy conference . The first time I went to that, I thought it was going to be a bunch of people from Silicon Valley companies. And what really struck me was seeing people from all kinds of organizations. Everybody’s got the same fundamental challenges when it comes to content. And we can talk that language with any organization and what we have found with Confab is that people come together and they all are kind of speaking the same language, they share the same pain points, and they’re looking for the same kinds of answers. And you know that is something that we really like to talk about too, is that you are going to learn from these speakers, but you’re also going to learn from your colleagues who are there at the conference. What’s really interesting is that the industry has changed so much and so rapidly, even just over the last two years as the idea of designing content for products, and now AI conversation design… It is a complicated thing to keep up with that with programming. The original vision for Confab was, “okay, UX designers and copywriters and corporate communicators and marketers and CMS wonks—let’s all come together under this big tent and learn each other’s language.” Because there hadn’t really been that opportunity before, you know? Go learn the language of your colleagues. That degree of collaboration is what’s required for really great content. That still is our vision, but now those conversations are taking place more and more in organizations. And what we’re finding is that people want to go deep. […] The speakers that we bring through the door to these conferences are the most articulate, thoughtful, funny people. And it’s hard for people to choose which sessions to go to. What I just always encourage people is, go learn the language of your colleagues. Yes, you want to take away tools but also go learn what’s on your colleagues’ minds because that degree of collaboration is what’s required for really great content. How do you like to organize your work? This is something that fascinates us here. I actually really enjoy using Evernote. Hooray! I seriously used to organize all of my client notes, and thinking, and attachments, and documentation in my inbox. Like I had a folder for every client and I would just dump all of the communication into the folder. I still cannot believe I functioned like that, and it was for a very long time. At Brain Traffic—I feel like I’m giving a plug for Evernote, maybe I am—but all of our business development correspondence happens in Evernote. All of our stakeholder interviews and initial discovery and analysis happens in Evernote. We all share different notebooks and folders. I write a lot of my talks in bed in the dark while I’m laying awake at night and can’t fall asleep, and then it’s just like my brain starts going. So I have a very intimate relationship with Evernote where I will just open it up on my phone and dictate into it at like 11 o’clock at night and that is how—I swear to God—that is how a lot of my talk material gets developed out of my brain.

For this episode and the next, we were pleased to invite productivity consultant Tiago Forte down to Evernote HQ for a two-part interview. Check out Part 1 now: Taking Note: Episode 5 http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-5-Tiago-Forte.mp3 Length: 22 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS You may recognize Tiago’s name from his guest posts for the Evernote blog, in which he’s argued for a brain-based approach to creative workflows and changing the productivity curve of our work days. More recently, he’s launched “ Building a Second Brain ,” a productivity boot camp for personal knowledge management. Highlights of our conversation are transcribed below. To hear the complete interview and subscribe to future episodes of “Taking Note,” head over to iTunes , SoundCloud , or Overcast . Let’s talk about the modern workforce. We all live in this giant paradox. We’ve got access to endless information and we’ve got more flexible ways to work than every before, but at the same time, we’ve got so many inputs. Our days are fractured. We’re frustrated. We’re burning out. And to add a paradox on top of a paradox, we’ve got this seemingly endless series of solutions which are presented to us, prescriptions and methods for productivity. What’s your solution to this problem? It’s just what you said. I mean, with great freedom comes great responsibility, right? It’s like we’re kids getting out of school, just throwing off our backpacks, “We’re free. We can work anytime, anywhere, on any device.” But then, summer vacation starts and we realize we’re kind of bored or frustrated or stressed because all the structure that is there in the workplace is gone. And I kind of have a theory about this. I call it the rise of the freelance generalist. Freelancing has been around a long time, but almost by definition you had to be a specialist. You had to be a very niche, focused specialist because that was the only way that you had skills that could be monetized easily enough that you could do away with the organization. And that kind of provided its own structure. You’d wake up in the morning and know that you were doing copywriting, you were doing coding, you were doing design. It was pretty straightforward. Now, I think technology is reaching an inflection point where it’s easy to use enough, cheap enough, seamless enough, frictionless enough, that you can be a generalist, which is what I consider myself to be, and make a living as a freelancer using these tools. Are there solutions out there that you find are counterproductive? Yes, there are. In particular, the trend with deep work. I’m opposed. You know, I get it. People are feeling frazzled and just scatterbrained and all these things. But I really think this idea that you’re sort of this monastic knowledge worker, that you’re going to enter your chambers and just think deeply for hours and hours and hours on end, is a holdover from that freelance specialist mindset. And following up on that idea of a generalist as a freelancer, to do that effectively you need a portfolio. You can’t have just one narrow skill that you do. You need a portfolio. You can’t have just one narrow skill that you do. And this is kind of how I think now. I have free products — like my blog I write for free for lead generation — but then I have other things that are not free, like online courses. Then I have consulting and corporate training for companies, but also one-on-one coaching for consumers. So it’s like I’m constantly managing this portfolio of products and services. Some are passive, some are active. What that requires is not this kind of intense mono-focus. It requires being very skilled and fluid with switching between things. Multi-tasking is not going away. That’s not a disease or a plague. It’s just the way the world is going. We can either fight it and treat it like a threat, or we can get better at it. You wrote a guest piece for the Evernote blog not too long ago where you got into some of these topics. You argued that since our days are filled with these interruptions constantly, and those interruptions do make it harder to deliver value from our work, maybe instead of trying to alter the shape of our days, we should try to alter the shape of our value curves and deliver more value in smaller pieces throughout the day. That post came from a lot of research I’d been doing on the history of productivity, specifically manufacturing. And it’s kind of amazing being here in Silicon Valley that we have this breathless fascination with technology and the future, which is great, but a side effect of that is we ignore history. If you look at the history of manufacturing, one of the great, great insights that took decades and decades to discover was small batches, right? That was one of the key breakthroughs to better quality, to speed, to more throughput, to more profitability in manufacturing. And then you go to knowledge work and you have the deep work thing, which is another way of saying big batch sizes. Deep work, spending hours and hours in deep flow, is a big batch size. So it’s like we’ve completely gone against decades of experience in manufacturing. But, like with the example of Toyota developing this entire culture around it, using small batch sizes requires skill, and requires a different way of thinking and doing things. So with the question of changing the value curve, I always kind of come back to this idea that there’s no inherent structure to work. Work has no inherent unit. We make units; we make tasks, and projects, and milestones, and goals. But nothing about those is inherent in the nature of work. So that’s a little scary because it’s all arbitrary, but it’s also an opportunity because it means we can use whatever units we want. There’s no inherent structure to work. Work has no inherent unit. We make units. But nothing about those is inherent in the nature of work. Say, the word “project.” That word comes with baggage. All these ideas about how big should a project be, how long should it last, how much money should it make, how many people should be on a project? I almost like using different words. I have this one word “intermediate packet.” Instead of “deliverable,” I say an intermediate packet. Try to finish every working session, whether it’s 15 minutes or 8 hours, with an intermediate packet that you expose to the world; that you get some sort of feedback on. I look at my to-do lists and I’m kind of overwhelmed by that. I don’t even necessarily get 25 minutes free because there are meetings and there are requests, and there are emails, and it’s all coming in constantly. Is there any way to get past that sense of overwhelm? There is, and this is starting to get into the particular philosophy I have around using Evernote, actually. This is my main project these days, it’s an online course called “ Building a Second Brain ,” that’s actually a virtual boot camp because it’s not self-paced, take whenever you want, however you want. It’s five weeks, really intense, two meetings per week, and live video conferences. And essentially, it’s an end-to-end personal knowledge management system. PKM, personal knowledge management, is related to PIM, personal information management. It’s basically making use of the knowledge that you gain on a personal level. Knowledge management, traditionally, has been organizations. When an employee walked out the door, all the knowledge that person had gained would go with them. So for years now, organizations have been trying to capture and catalog and use the knowledge of their employees. Well, now if you look at the research, employee tenure is at, I think, 2.3 years. We spend a couple of years at a company. We do a few projects, a certain number of projects, and we’re gone. We need a better way to take knowledge with us. Not proprietary, confidential stuff, but actually just the insights and the breakthroughs and the learnings that we gained in the course of our work. You mentioned that this plays into how you use Evernote. I know when you do the “Building a Second Brain” course and the other workshops you do, you try to structure them in a way so that they’re not tied to a particular platform or tool, but you are an Evernote user and Evernote is sort of the default example you give. So let’s talk about how you use Evernote. How is it set up? How is your personal Evernote set up? I have this method I’ve developed called PARA, which stands for projects, areas, resources, and archives . And the inspiration from this — a little bit of historical background — is something called the OODA loop, which stands for observe, orient, decide, and act . It was developed by this guy named Colonel John Boyd starting the the ’40s or ’50s. He essentially used it to revolutionize aircraft fighter warfare. And it was basically a way of thinking about how to react dynamically to quickly changing conditions. You observe, you orient yourself, you decide on a course of action, and then you act. It’s been an incredible inspiration for a lot of people in a lot of fields. It’s sort of underappreciated, the impact it’s had. But the thing that really sets is apart is it’s not a static way of thinking. It’s not like a flow chart — do A, do B, do C, do D. It’s loops, and then loops within loops, and then loops within those loops. Because you’re at all times intaking information, turning that into decisions, and then into actions. And it’s the same with PARA. PARA is 4 categories, and that’s kind of the starting point. You divide your work into projects, which I’m using here the GTD definition, a series of tasks linked to an outcome. Areas of responsibility: Some standard or area of your life that’s an ongoing concern; that you want to maintain on an ongoing basis. Resources: Basically, interests or topics. Things like website design. For me, it’s not a particular project — not even really an area because that’s not my work — but it’s something I’m interested in that I’d like to keep track of. And then Archives, which is anything from the previous three categories that’s no longer active, because you want to avoid clogging up your actionable categories. As soon as something is not top of mind, not front and center, you want to move it to the archives, but still keep it in case you want to go and find something there. You have a whole workshop around applying design thinking to workflows, and to doing day-to-day work. What concepts do you draw from design thinking, and how do they apply? Great question. Design thinking is an incredible way of thinking; an incredible movement, really, and taking place across many decades. The thing I take away the most from design thinking, especially when it comes to productivity and personal knowledge management, is just really the idea that you are a designer . Each one of us truly is a designer by nature, even if not by training. And that’s something that’s hard for people to get used to. Each one of us truly is a designer by nature, even if not by training. And that’s something that’s hard for people to get used to. I actually had a previous course called “Design Your Habits.” It was on habit formation. And I had to be constantly explaining to people, because they would see “Design Your Habits” and they’d go “Oh, I’m not a designer. I didn’t go to design school.” And I’d have to be like, “No, you design habits. If you’re trying to lose weight and you want to change your diet, you design this whole routine that might be around exercise, or walking, or food. And you do that, in most cases, pretty instantaneously, intuitively, and just naturally on the course of your day.” It’s a spontaneous process, but it does involve, I think, a lot of the same steps; sort of looking around and taking stock of sort of the elements in front of you, thinking of a workflow and a process, having some sort of a feedback loop. Yes, design thinking, getting this process that has become a profession and bringing it back to its origins, which is just the way humans think. We are designers, we make, we create, we modify, we get new information and we change, we tweak. That’s completely natural to what it means to be human.

Tiago Forte , a productivity consultant based in San Francisco, wants to help you think for yourself. “I try to provoke people,” he says. “I try to find what is becoming the common wisdom that ‘everyone’ knows, and just attack it. Because that gets people thinking.” In Part 1 of our podcast interview with Tiago, we talked about chaos in the modern workplace, the virtues of small-batch productivity vs. deep work, and the system Tiago has devised to organize his thinking in Evernote. For Part 2, we take a deeper look at how he structures his notes and get a peek into “ Building a Second Brain ,” Tiago’s five-week boot camp for personal knowledge management. Taking Note: Episode 6 http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-6-Tiago-Forte-Part2.mp3 Length: 20 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS Selected highlights of our conversation are transcribed below. Please note that this episode builds on concepts Tiago introduced in Episode 5, such as the “PARA” organizing system (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) and Tiago’s argument for breaking down work projects into “intermediate packets.” You may want to check out that episode before diving into this one. You wrote a guest blog post for us awhile back, a very lengthy one, and one that generated a lot of discussion. In it, you argued pretty forcefully against something that is a key factor in many people’s organization of Evernote, and that is tagging. If I remember correctly, you argued that it was putting a lot of effort where it wasn’t delivering value. Could you expand on that? I try to provoke people. I try to find what is becoming the common wisdom that “everyone” knows, and just attack it because it just gets people thinking. Like the comments on that post and the various messages I received through social media, in many cases people counter-arguing against me and saying, “No, you’re wrong for this reason, this reason, this reason.” That, right there, was some of the best thinking I’ve ever seen on this stuff. They were provoked into defending their viewpoint. I may have kind of been a bit melodramatic on purpose. It’s not that I never use tags or think tags are completely worthless. It’s just a pattern I see with people. Working with people one on one is always so illuminating because they get so caught up in their tagging system. It becomes this game of perfectionism that’s never quite ready. It’s the same thing with like evaluating which program is correct, right? I actually see people like, “Oh, yeah, I have all these book notes on paper. I want to wait until I have my tagging system correct to get these into my database.” Meanwhile, they’re stuck in — in some cases, literally — a cardboard box in your closet. All of that knowledge is going stale, or at least not being used, because you don’t have the “perfect system.” Yeah, I’ve definitely heard cases of that as well. Because they want to get that tagging system just right, and then apply all the tags to everything. And they’ve got hundreds and hundreds of tags. And I wonder, are you spending more time tagging than you’re spending using the information? I have a good antidote to that. Temporary tags. I think where the pressure comes from, that pressure to have everything perfect, is the “long-term” thing. The idea that this is going to be around forever, so it needs to last years and years. So what I do is I have project-specific tags. For a given project, I use tags to track my progress to that deliverable or that intermediate packet. And then once in a while, usually when I do my monthly review for GTD, I delete all my tags. So every single month I have a blank slate, which sounds crazy because you think all that work is going to waste. But I got what I wanted, which was the deliverable, the project outcome. And the interesting thing is it allows me to bring my creativity to it. Some months I’ll do tagging based on emotions. The next month, the slate is clean, I’ll do tagging based on deliverables. Next month, I’ll do tagging based on time slots. And I’ve just discovered so many little things that I wouldn’t have been able to discover just thinking about it abstractly, but actually trying it. And there’s never any pressure because I know, at most, a month from now it’s all going to go away. What about your notes themselves? We all have different ways of taking notes, especially when we have a tool like Evernote to work with. Is there a particular style that your notes tend to have? A very particular one. So, there are the three pillars of the course that I teach: capture , organize , and retrieve . The middle one, organize , is the PARA system. The first one, capture , is something I call “progressive summarization.” This is a method I’ve developed over a number of years that is essentially designing notes; really putting a lot of thought into the design of individual notes. But the way I do this is not maybe what you typically think of design… I’ll take notes on a source, whether it’s a conversation, an article, a book, a podcast, audiobook, whatever. And then I just put it in my system. Just the raw notes. The next time I see that, the next time I serendipitously come across it — or it might be that I’m looking for a project or looking for a resource that I want to use this note for — I summarize it. The first layer, as I call it, is bolding. I go though, and I’m already reading the source anyway, I bold the best parts. The next time I see it, which could be months later, in some cases a year or two later, I do the next layer: I highlight in yellow only the best bolded parts.[…] There’s an 80/20 thing, where a tiny minority of your notes has the great majority of value. So it makes sense to concentrate your design attention on that small minority that’s actually very insightful, rather than spread your attention equally across all your notes, which is what I see with tagging. You may spend a minute tagging a note that has very little value, which doesn’t seem like a lot but that’s one minute too much for me. a tiny minority of your notes has the great majority of value. So it makes sense to concentrate your design attention on that small minority. You’ve talked a bit about the boot camp/workshop called “ Building a Second Brain .” I believe you’ve run that twice now. So what are you learning from running that pretty intensive program, and are you going to keep it going? I’m definitely keeping it going. It’s been, honestly, the most rewarding project I’ve ever worked on, and for just the reason you said. I learn, without a doubt, more than anyone actually taking the course. In each group, we’ve had between 50 and 55 people. And reading their bios, because I do some Linkedin stalking, their bios are incredible. They’re engineers, they’re Ph.D.s, doctors, professors, startup CEOs. Incredible people that have spent, in many cases, just as long as I have thinking about personal knowledge management. So they come with their own insights, perhaps not quite as structured as the way that I’m presenting it, but I’m on the sessions presenting, and on the side, taking notes from what everyone else is saying. It’s been a great experience. What do you go through in the workshop? Did you say it was five weeks? How do you break that down? It’s really those three pillars. So we start with organization, because people usually have this mass of messy notes they’re not too happy with. And so to kind of give them the initial confidence to really dive in, we start with PARA. So after the first week, they have every single digital file in their life, actually, because PARA is not only Evernote, it goes across cloud storage, your file system, your task manager… everything. So it’s really a universal digital organizing system. That’s the first part of the course. The we go to progressive summarization and cover capture, and really build the skill — and it is a skill — to capture not just the original note, but the insights and the most important ideas within that note. And then we end the course with retrieval, which is a method called “just in time project management,” which is sort of related to the intermediate packet thing. It’s always working towards the next intermediate packet in these short sprints. And building systems and support routines and all this so that you can do that as quickly and with as much acceleration as possible. And you mentioned that you get some really interesting people who are taking these classes, because I presume a class like that is going to appeal to a certain type of person. Have any of the people that you have taught in this course changed the way you think about some of these issues? Oh, absolutely. I mean, one thing was this technique of layering and summarizing, one of the students was a Finnish entrepreneur in the music business. And he got that idea and said, “Okay, I get it, but I’m going to completely change it and apply it to music.” I thought it was a textual analysis method. He showed me that it’s actually about the structure of any sort of information. Layer Zero for him is just all of his notes on random songs and concertos, sources and inspiration, sounds, instruments, all these things. Layer 1 is anything that he’s put into a piece of music. Layer 2 is anything that he’s performed for someone else. Layer 3 is anything that he’s recorded. It’s kind of like a topology of your knowledge that has peaks. The peaks are where your thinking has gone the furthest, whereas the valleys are where the thinking is still kind of raw and unfiltered. So that kind of blew my mind, and I’m still trying to work out the implications of what does it mean to apply this to images, to photographs, to art, to sports and the movement of the body? It’s a pretty fundamental principle that you want to surface the key components of any body of knowledge. And that ties into some of the things you’ve mentioned throughout this interview. You talked about the art of organizing. You talked about how on a core level we’re all designers. And you’ve talked about the importance of creativity. How can we foster creativity within a productivity system? Great question. I love that because there’s this implicit assumption that they’re opposites. I get this all the time, actually. People come up to me, sometimes, and their initial entry will be, “I don’t like productivity because it’s about being efficient, and like a machine, and just sticking to the plan.” And I just go, “Whoa, whoa, whoa. What’s your definition of productivity?” And they tell me something like, “Oh, what machines do, basically.” And then I say, “Can I tell you my definition?” And my definition is creating as much value in the world as efficiently and as effectively as possible. And they go, “Oh, well, I can buy that.” My definition of productivity is creating as much value in the world as efficiently and as effectively as possible. No. And that’s where creativity comes in. It takes immense creativity to use processes in that way. To not be a slave to the process, to not just obey the process, but to think, “This part isn’t working,” or to have the courage to say, “Look, this process we’ve always followed does not serve our purposes. It’s no longer in line with our values. Let’s change it.” That’s one of the insights from the Toyota Production System, is when you give workers the freedom to point things out — to pull the cord, so to speak — they come up with an incredible number of ideas. They think of things that management would never think about in a million years. Small things, big things, human things, software things, hardware things. And it’s almost like having the foundation or the structure — we talked about structure before — already in place, just like a scaffolding gives you these little pockets where creativity can happen. Because the thing with creativity is, creativity cannot happen without constraints. This is a really important point. The same with design. Design cannot happen without constraints. If you tell me “just design something” … Oh, what should I design? What are the user needs? What is the purpose it serves? What are the constraints? And you give me none? I literally cannot design anything useful. Another term that gets used a lot and has an inherent assumption of a dichotomy is “work-life balance.” We all say we want it, at the same time work and life seem to be blending together. And I mean, that’s nothing new … farmers, artisans, soldiers have always had a blended work and life experience, but it’s new to office workers. Is this a trend we should be fighting or embracing? My initial reaction is fighting, going along the “provoking people” thing. And you know, my take on that is just … I just don’t get it. I don’t think about work-life balance. I don’t think about work-life blending or whatever the new term is. I think that whole way of thinking is an artifact of a previous time. Just having those two things that need to be balanced or blended or whatever it is, assumes there’s a division, there’s a dichotomy. And I see the consequences of that are many. One thing I notice is, people not giving much credit to themselves for side projects. Like a programmer works on an open source project, and they think, “Oh, I’m not getting paid, so it doesn’t fall in the ‘work’ category.” Therefore, they’ll be hesitant to put it on their resume. They won’t really use it as evidence that they continue to learn and improve. And I go, “Oh my gosh, that is one of your key assets. The fact that you do this stuff for fun, it’s a part of you and what you care about and what matters to you, not just something you do for money? That should be front and center in your resume or your portfolio.” You can hear the complete interview and subscribe to future episodes of “Taking Note” at iTunes , SoundCloud , or Overcast", "date": "2017-06-5,"},

In the first half of a two-part conversation, Josh reveals the hidden source of organizational frustration, suggests an easy way to gain control over clutter, and tells us how he wound up with such a cool job in the first place. Take a listen: Taking Note: Episode 7 http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-7-Joshua-Zerkel.mp3 Length: 17 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS Selected highlights: I saw a quote of yours in a recent article from Business Insider : “Productivity is a nice byproduct of organization. The real difference is in how empowered you feel in your work and, really, your life.” We tend to focus so much on outputs and quantity, I wonder if we’re ignoring something that’s more fundamental. I would say that we are, based on my experience working with people on productivity and organization over the years. No one ever comes to someone like me, a productivity consultant, saying, “I want to feel more empowered over my life.” What they say is, “I have piles of paper on my desk,” or, “I have zillions of digital files, and I want to fix those. I want to get those problems under control.” What’s underneath that is really this feeling of disempowerment. Going through your work or through your life disempowered puts you in a bad spot on a perpetual ongoing basis until you get those things under control. To me, the real benefit of getting organized or being more productive is that feeling of empowerment, “I’ve gained control over this thing that was challenging for me.” Once you have that sense of empowerment, you can do much better work. You feel better. You think more clearly. You have better relationships because things that are troublesome or are getting in the way just aren’t there anymore. That’s the biggest benefit I’ve seen from people who I’ve helped get organized in the past. After they get organized they say, “I never thought I’d feel this way. I thought I might get my desk organized or I might get my files under control, but I didn’t really realize that it would help me think more clearly or help me feel more empowered over my work.” Once you have that sense of empowerment, you can do much better work. You feel better. You think more clearly. So it’s really about getting to that problem behind the problem. The real problem is that none of us are ever taught how to get organized, or how to manage our time, or how to manage our digital files… I think that’s why we see this proliferation of blogs, and articles, and people like me, consultants, who are designed to help people figure out these things that we’re somehow supposed to know how to do but are never really taught. There are so many options out there. There are so many solutions. Sometimes they conflict. Is there a best place to start? There is a best place to start. Typically, it’s with whatever’s driving you the most crazy, because that’s where you’ll feel that you’ve made the most progress. For instance, if seeing piles of paper on your desk every day is driving you insane and they’re also getting in the way of you doing your work because you can’t find the thing that you need to, then starting there might be a good spot. If you are having a different type of problem, like you can’t find the files on your computer because everything’s a mess and you don’t have a good search tool, maybe putting things in Evernote would help you get more organized, and that would make you feel better and hopefully help you be more productive. It’s really that, “This is driving me crazy,” is a really good place to begin. You’re saying that this can be a very immediate thing, a very visceral thing. You don’t have to necessarily sit down and make a whole big inventory of all the things that you’re dealing with. That is essentially it. I’ve seen people go to great lengths, spending lots of time planning how they’re going to get organized, but I have yet to see that actually work in practice. Because they spend so much time planning how they’re going to get organized that they never actually do it . I’ve seen this time and again: “Well, I’m making more lists because the lists will help me get organized.” You can spend all day and all night making lists, but if you don’t actually do the things on the lists, you’re not actually achieving anything. We have this strange thing that can happen to us where we feel like we’re making progress but we’re actually not. We’re just organizing to get organized. There are a lot of different levels to what organization can be. Organizing my workspace, making sure that my desk is clean. Temporal organization where I’m cleaning up my calendar and thinking of time management. Or it could be cleaning up my digital files, or organizing my tasks. Are there any common principles that apply throughout all of those levels? Generally speaking, there are some common themes that apply whatever you’re trying to get organized. One is put like things together . If you, for instance, have a bunch of paper on your desk but you know they fall into certain categories, maybe you start by just grouping the piles by category. If this is applicable in your world of time management, maybe you’re having the same type of meeting but at different points throughout the week, maybe you could look at consolidating those a bit so you’re getting that same topic together rather than spreading it out. It’s really about what are the common themes amongst the things that I’m doing, and grouping those together. That’s one general tenet of getting organized. Put like things together, whatever those things might be. One general tenet of getting organized: Put like things together, whatever those things might be. Another one, and this can go sometimes too far down the path for most people or many people, is get rid of things you don’t need. This is where people often get stuck in the organizing process. You don’t have to get stuck there. It’s really about deciding what you do need, and then if there are things you know for certain that you don’t, maybe you get rid of those. This could take the form of physical things. Oftentimes, this is the, “I might use it someday,” syndrome. If “someday” hasn’t come in a long time and you really can’t perceive a point where you might need the thing, whether it’s a document, or a physical object, or the type of meeting that you’ve been having that you continually push off, maybe you just look at getting rid of that thing. You don’t have to go all the way to minimalism, but maybe just start with the things that are easy to get rid of. There are so many places to put your stuff. There are so many inputs that are coming at us from all directions. How do you manage those inputs? How I manage them personally is how I typically recommend other people manage them whenever possible. We can’t control where the inputs are coming from or how often we’re going to get them, but what we can control is how we’re notified about them, and how often, and when we choose to respond. For me, I receive almost no notifications. The truth is, I’m not in the type of the job that requires an immediate response. Maybe if I worked in PR that might be different, but the reality is any time someone sends me something, it can probably wait an hour or two before I get back to them, and the world will not end. To get control of the inputs really boils down to how you manage the notifications of those inputs, and then how you choose and when you choose to respond. For me, I typically respond a few times a day rather than in the moment. In the moment, I’m probably doing something else. It’s hard enough for me to find time to sit down and focus on doing deep work. I don’t need to be notified or bothered by something that isn’t relevant to that work at that moment.

Take a listen: Taking Note: Episode 8 http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-8-Joshua-Zerkel-Part2.mp3 Length: 16 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS Selected highlights: I notice you are probably the only person who’s ever come onto this podcast without a phone in your hand. Do you tend to leave it behind? I do. I don’t want to be tethered by technology. I want it to be a tool that I decide to use. Typically, if I’m doing something important like attending a meeting, I’m not typing on my computer the whole time. I’m trying to focus on the thing that’s at hand. Having the phone with me just reminds me there’s another door I can open. I’m trying to reduce my number of inputs because I want to focus. I want to really be where I am and be present. In my bigger life outside of Evernote, I’m trying to be more mindful of all sorts of things, and being present is really important to me. One of the ways I do that is by carrying around a limited number of tech tools with me. The ironic thing is I love gizmos, and I love apps, and I love tools, but I’m trying to be judicious about how and where I use them. Let’s talk a little bit about your own personal system. How do you structure your day? I’m not what I would call a morning person, but the morning is when I have most of my creative energy. I try to structure my day in a way that best leverages when I’m at my mental peak. My most important projects, the things I really need to focus on or do deep work on, I try to schedule those in the morning. And then all the busy work I try to schedule towards the latter part of the day. Oftentimes, you’ll see me front-load both my week and my day with the things that are most critical. I often find if I schedule my most important things in the beginning of the week, then the week doesn’t get away from me and get away from those things that I have deemed priorities for whatever reason, because the further you put things away in the week, the more likely they are to get bumped. If you’re a freelancer or if you’re in business for yourself, then you have a lot more control (in theory, at least), but if you’re just working in an office, then a lot of your time is not your own. People are putting things onto your calendar. You’ve got commitments within the office on a daily, weekly, monthly basis… Do you have a strategy for people whose calendars are already full? Well, generally what I say to people whose calendars are totally full is you probably need to be doing fewer things. I would look at reprioritizing because if your days are so packed back to back to back that you’re having trouble finding the time to eat, or go to the bathroom, or be a normal human and take five minutes for a break, then how are you spending your time? What are you spending it on? What permission are you giving other people to dictate how your time is spent? How are you spending your time? What permission are you giving other people to dictate how your time is spent? I think it’s worth taking a step back and really look at your time as an entity and how much importance are you putting on being in control of it? The easiest thing to do, and this is true in work and in life, is just go by default, “Well, things get scheduled and I just go.” If you really want to feel that sense of empowerment, you need to choose how you spend your time. All of us, whether we realize it or not, are choosing. We’re sometimes choosing to be disempowered or choosing to be empowered, but I encourage people to make that choice. We talked earlier about how it’s easy to fall into this trap of preparing to organize. You wind up lost in the minutiae of creating a system. Does the same thing happen with maintaining a system? Can you put so much structure around what you’re trying to do that it becomes unsustainable? I think so. In my experience, the thing that I’ve seen be successful is having just enough structure rather than over-structure. Over-structure or spending a lot of time thinking about your structure typically leads to what I would call organizational burnout, where you’re spending a lot of time thinking about your structure rather than actually doing the things. There are people, I would call them productivity junkies, who love the different systems that get put out every so often, and there are always new ones, and switching systems, and tweaking their systems. If that’s you and you find that that actually works for you, great. That is certainly not me. I’m like the lazy person’s organizer. I’m like the minimal amount of organization necessary to get to the things that are actually important to you. I would say if you find yourself spending a lot of time on your organizational systems, you might want to look at simplifying them a bit because it’s not supposed to be that hard. That’s the biggest myth, that organization is a tough thing. It shouldn’t be. How do you, personally, organize Evernote? This depends on the lens that I’m looking through. At Evernote, we use Evernote Business as a team. For us here, there are notebooks for each of the core projects that we’re working on. Within each of those notebooks, the ones that I am in all the time, I tend to organize by title. I use title a lot to keep things organized. I put the date, and then I put the topic. That helps me easily scan through the list of notes that are there. I like to have as much information on the screen as possible, so I often have just title view that has all of the details about the title, because then I can sort it really easily. For my personal life and my hobbies, and since I still have a consulting business, I have notebooks for my business topics like clients, and finance, and legal. I have those organized by the name of the business so they’re all grouped together in Evernote. Then all of my personal life like my hobbies, stuff about my house, all of those have their own notebooks, so it’s really easy for me to find things and share them when I need them. What’s your number one secret tip for Evernote? I’m maybe a bit old school. I still think about my desk. On my desk, I always had, not piles per se, but organized folders of the things I was working on. The way that I’ve translated into the electronic world is shortcuts in Evernote. If you were to look at my shortcuts, you would see shortcuts for each one of the main projects that I’m working on which, if they were on my desk, they would be in a folder. My shortcuts are kind of like my desk. I change my shortcuts all the time based on what I’m working on. To me, shortcuts are a really unused or underutilized part of Evernote that can really help people be much more organized when they think about how to structure it. My shortcuts are kind of like my desk. Shortcuts are a really underutilized part of Evernote. Tell me a little bit about what the Evernote Community Program does, and then I’m curious as to what you’ve learned from being in this role The Evernote Community is really designed to connect people who love Evernote and want to share it with other people, to the people who want to learn about it. This can take the form of a community leader speaking at a meet-up or hosting their own meet-up in their local area, or it could take the form of an Evernote Certified Consultant working with a small business who wants to implement Evernote amongst their team. It’s about connecting people who either want to learn about Evernote or love Evernote together. For me, the most awesome thing about this particular role is how diverse the people who love and use Evernote are, and all of the awesome ways that they are bringing it to their own communities. This takes the form of everything from online, social media, discussion forums, blog posts, online classes to in-person events like small group workshops to hosting meet-ups, as I mentioned, to being with me when I’m on tour and speaking on a panel discussion. Just the diversity of the people, their clients, where they are, is endlessly fascinating to me. If you go to the Evernote Community calendar , you’ll see dozens of events happening online and offline every month. Those are sponsored and hosted by Community members themselves of their own initiative. It’s amazing to me. They love it and they want to share it with people in their network. It’s just really gratifying to see that. It’s not just any old person who says, “I’m an Evernote expert,” right? There’s a whole training program for people who want to get into this. Yeah, especially for people who want to be Evernote Certified Consultants. You have to be willing to dedicate some of your time to our training program, because it shows you all of the ins and out of Evernote, and it shows you how to not just talk about it, but really in-depth ways to bring Evernote’s workflows to your customers and your clients in a way that provides a lot of value. It’s not like you can just hang your shingle out and say, “I’m an Evernote Certified Consultant.” The program was specifically designed to really give people lots of tools to help them bring Evernote to their people in the way that makes the most sense. People always surprise me. They surprise me with their workflows. They surprise me with their level of passion. You’ve spent years as a professional organizer. You’ve spent years within the Evernote ecosystem and as an Evernote employee. Are you still sometimes surprised when you go on the road and you talk to people? Yeah. I think because of the nature of working with humans, people always surprise me. They surprise me with their workflows. They surprise me with their level of passion. I’ve gone to events where people have shown me their handmade Evernote T-shirts where they’ve designed their own puff paint Evernote logos. People love this thing. That’s the part that surprises me the most. I mean, it does and it doesn’t, because I know personally the difference that Evernote makes for people because I’ve spent so many years involved, but seeing it on a continual basis and seeing it around the world, it’s just amazing to me.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How to Plan an Amazing Trip of a Lifetime", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-to-plan-an-amazing-trip-of-a-lifetime/", "abstract": "Have you dreamed of having éclairs at an outdoor café in Paris, or seeing the northern lights in person? Have you ever imagined gasping in wonder as you photograph wild giraffes in Africa? Or do you just want to see the tiny village where your grandmother was born? If you dream of far-off destinations and adventures, don’t keep them in your head. What if this year, you made your travel dreams a reality? What if 2018 is the year you make your trip of a lifetime happen? With careful thought, research, and planning, your trip of a lifetime can go from pipe dream to boarding the plane. Whether you’re taking your laptop with you on vacation, or are traveling light with just a phone, put everything together and ensure a smooth trip with Evernote. We talked to travel experts to get tips for using Evernote before, during, and after your trip. And, we teamed up with Barbara Fuller from Simplify Days to provide you with the perfect templates to imagine and plan: Travel Calendar Template Travel Daily Itinerary Template Trip Planning Template Travel Inspiration Template Lefkada, Greece. Photo: Kerry Murray Madrid-based David Lengen and Bas Ellen run the travel blog MrHudsonExplores.com . David and Bas think beyond ordinary vacations like resorts, cruises, and package deals. They know that “once-in-a-lifetime” means just that. They have one chance to get it right, so they’re not taking any risks. “We look at travel planning in four phases,” David explains. “Inspiration, Planning and Booking, In-Trip, and After Trip. We look very carefully at each phase to make sure we’re getting everything just right.” Inspiration for your trip of a lifetime Bas says he starts the inspiration phase with brainstorming and Web Clipper . “Your dream depends on what you value, and what you find special,” he says. “If you know what your vision is, plan for that.” David and Bas each clip articles and pictures they like into a shared inspiration notebook that they can discuss when it’s time to choose the next destination. “Your dream depends on what you value, and what you find special.”—Bas Ellen “Don’t rely on marketing from the properties to make your decision,” David cautions. “Look on Instagram, travel blogs, trusted magazines. If you’re starting to narrow down where you’re going, talk to people who’ve been there.” This is also the time to research attractions, restaurants, and hotels, Bas advises. “If you have your eye on a particular Michelin-starred restaurant, you’re going to need a lot of time in advance to get a reservation.” Pro Tip: Evernote Web Clipper will create a new note for each item you clip, so keep all your inspirations together by copying and pasting your clip directly into your template. Research is key when it comes to travel budgets, too, Bas says. “You can have a dream vacation if you know the right time to go.” Bas offers a few rules of thumb: If you haven’t decided on a destination, research where you can afford to go Aim for “ shoulder-season ” if you can to avoid the crowds and the highest prices Track flight trends with an app like Hopper and buy when fares are low Consider booking a series of one-way flights on multiple airlines—they’re often cheaper than a round-trip fare Lake Como, Italy.  Photo: Kerry Murray Planning and Booking: On the road again You’ve picked the perfect vacation spot. Now it’s time to put details into place. And when Bas Ellen talks about specifics, he means it. “I don’t like surprises,” he says solemnly. “So I plan everything to the nth degree.” Travel planning at this stage is a series of emails, receipts, maps, confirmation numbers, and other data that doesn’t seem very important before you go. But if you don’t have it together when you’re traveling, it can ruin your trip. This is where your Trip Planning template and your Calendar template become invaluable. Josh Zerkel , who spent years traveling the world hosting Evernote Community events, offers tips for using Evernote on the road that even the most experienced traveler might miss. “Did you know you can download Google Maps to your smartphone and use it offline? That’s important if you’re traveling in an area where Wi-Fi is scarce or expensive, and you don’t want to use your data plan for mapping,” Josh says. “Plug in specific directions, like from your hotel to a restaurant. Grab the link from those directions, and put it in your Trip Planning template next to the entry for that restaurant. Then, when you’re ready to go, just tap the link, and your directions are waiting for you.” “When you can get to your notebook without internet, you will save time and money.” —Josh Zerkel Maps aren’t the only place you can use note links to organize your trip to be stress-free. Josh suggests these traveling pro tips: Have Evernote downloaded on all your travel devices—laptops, phones, and tablets. Keep a shared notebook for all your travel plans and share it with your companions. Keep your travel notebook in your Evernote shortcuts for quick access. Scan your important travel documents to Evernote. If you lose the real ones, or even if you lose your phone or laptop, the copies will be available in your secure web account from any computer. Use Evernote email forwarding or Web Clipper to put all your important reservations, itineraries, tickets, and confirmation numbers in your travel notebook. Maintain an essential daily travel itinerary. See a day-by-day view of what you plan to do, and make changes on the fly. The most important advice? “Make your travel notebook available offline before you go,” Josh says. “You’d be surprised how many people don’t know you can do that. When you can get to your notebook without internet, you will save time and money.” Cape Town, South Africa.  Photo: Kerry Murray While you’re on the trip The best time to write about your travel experiences is when you’re still on the journey. Put your thoughts into Evernote, either in the templates or in a new note. Add checkboxes to your to-do list, and tick each item off as you complete it. Organize your thoughts and draft blog posts about your trip of a lifetime. Capture your thoughts and feelings on the go—your memory is fresher. Add photos you want to share later. If you need to print something, you can use the computer in the hotel’s business center to access your Evernote account from a browser. Share your travel notebook with folks back home so they can see what you’re up to every day. And be a little jealous. Pro Tip: Have unchecked items left over at the end of the trip? Josh recommends moving those items into a new note, so you’re already starting to plan for next time. After you get back It’s always a little bittersweet when a vacation is over, but remember that part of the fun is preserving the memories. Turn your notebook into a travel scrapbook for yourself and your friends. Become a subject matter expert for someone else—make a public version of your note for others to see. Just be sure to take out any private information before you do. Get these templates to start your travel planning and making 2018 happen!

Mansi Shah is an Engineer on Evernote’s iOS team. She has been with the company for a year and a half. How did you get into engineering? My love for computers and design led me to become an engineer. The ability to whip up some magic under the hood, and create the most visually appealing user experience at the same time, impacting millions of users — that’s what excites me the most about being an engineer. What role do you play on the iOS team? My role involves designing and building the user interface and core application, ensuring that the Evernote iOS users have fast, reliable and secure access to their notes. Working on a small, high-performance team means writing large amounts of reliable, scalable, and maintainable code. Removing technical debt is also an important part of the job, to enable considerable performance enhancements. The last and most important part is to constantly collaborate with the PM and designers to help design and build new features. What is the biggest technical challenge you’ve faced in the past year? The developers of Evernote for iOS in the past were struggling to add new features to the existing app, keep it working with newer versions of iOS, and untangle the technical debt in the code. To fix this we began an effort called Lightning to completely revamp the application with a new design, a new user interface, new software architecture, a new language (Swift 3.0) — but the biggest caveat to this was execution by a completely new team of 7 engineers. The challenges of being part of a new team were to understand each other’s strengths, collaborate effectively to make better-informed decisions, and to deliver fast, responsive, and high-quality product in a timely manner. This included learning a new language, rewriting and rearchitecting legacy code, and revisiting technical decisions made in the past. Agile development policies allowed the team to introduce faster development cycles and automate processes to foster rapid growth and scale. As a result of this effort, the product has become more reliable, easy to use, consistent, and future proof. This was a significant milestone in the engineering as well as product front, for our team, and for the company as a whole. How are the mobile engineering teams structured at Evernote? We have small, high-performance teams catering to each platform. But one really great thing I noticed is the way we structure many teams as cross-platform: ownership will be around a product or a feature. That lets us build cohesive products that can stand own their own on each platform, but all sharing a common user experience language. Common decisions are made in the best interest of all platforms. The process employed is efficient and there is a lot of fluidity. You will also see some people owning features in both iOS and Android. The team is like a small task force on a feature/product, creating more collaboration and communication, which in turn makes the team closer. How much autonomy do engineers have at Evernote? I will never forget my first week at Evernote where I was given a task to improve the photo picker experience on just my second day. I had to get well-versed with the code and get this feature in immediately for the next release. And to my surprise, I also got the opportunity to showcase this cool feature in front of the entire company in our weekly Demo Day. This experience bowled me over. There is a strong focus on giving engineers at Evernote as much autonomy as they are comfortable with and holding them responsible for making good use of that freedom. If you have a high bar for hiring, you can assume that you will be working with the most intelligent and dedicated people who will pick the most important projects and steer them from ideation to execution to deployment. What is the most satisfying part of your job? Just the fact that every line of code I punch in impacts 100 million users is the most exhilarating part of the job. Also, another most beautiful thing I have discovered working here is building this innate relationship with customers with the continuous, iterative feedback and improvement cycles that we go into. Design and playing with colors is my other passion, thus naturally I love working on aesthetically appealing and beautifully designed applications, which I get to do in abundance here. What is your favorite Evernote feature? There is no single favorite feature, as I use Evernote for almost everything. I use it to manage my to-do list at work, to keep a track of my household chores, to scan my receipts and important documents so that I never lose them, and to clip web articles that I find really helpful specifically related to design, architecture, and fashion. I also really love the fact that I can organize my information into notebooks and stacks and access them easily through the powerful search engine that Evernote provides. What advice do you have for young women in tech? The most important thing is to identify what you love to do the most and then have a tunnel vision focus to achieve it and the rest will follow. The thing that drives me every morning is to become the best version of myself and not compare myself to anyone. Improving and seeing myself grow and excel in what I love to do gives me a high. Finding a support group of women in similar situations is incredibly helpful, people with whom you can share your experiences and hear “oh yeah, me too, I went through the same thing.” Gaining the support and motivation that comes from finding others in similar situations helps a great deal. What is a fun fact about you? Apart from being this geek at work nibbling with bits and bytes, in my free time I love to pursue this other passion of mine and that is art & design. My imagination is always out for a wild run. I love doing up different spaces, creating wall arts. I also love rejuvenating myself with cooking, dancing, and outdoor activities.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Finding Focus: How to Take Control of ADHD with Evernote", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-to-take-control-of-adhd-with-evernote/", "abstract": "October is ADHD (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) Awareness Month. We asked Nikki Kinzer and Pete Wright, hosts of Take Control: The ADHD Podcast , for their thoughts on how Evernote can help children and adults with ADHD keep their jobs, studies, and lives in order. As a certified ADHD coach, Nikki Kinzer knows how deeply Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder can impact people’s lives. ADHD is often associated with children, but only about 40 percent of children with ADHD will ever outgrow it. The remaining 60 percent will carry ADHD with them into adulthood. Approximately 8 million adults in the United States, or 4 percent of the adult population, is estimated to be struggling with this challenging condition, although most cases are undiagnosed. The stakes are high. According to a study published by Contemporary Pediatrics , 50 to 60 percent of students with ADHD who start college will not finish with a degree. High school students with ADHD are less likely to attend college at all, and those who do can expect to have significant problems adjusting to the fast pace and independent lifestyle of the college environment. Without some help and accommodation, college drop-out rates are high. The ADHD Brain in College But the news isn’t all bad. More colleges are recognizing ADHD as a legitimate brain disorder (as opposed to a behavioral problem that can be corrected) and are designing accommodations for it. Kinzer’s clients are increasingly successful in both college and the workplace, but they still need some one-on-one support. Podcast Host and ADHD Coach Nikki Kinzer “If someone calls me, they usually feel overwhelmed, or there’s something that’s challenging them with their ADHD,” Kinzer explains. “I work with them on a weekly basis. We go over goals, find strategies to help them reach those goals, keeping ADHD in mind. ADHD brains have to get there a little bit differently,” she says. She works with clients individually, usually over the phone, to help them organize and increase productivity, breaking down projects into smaller pieces. For college students, Kinzer says: “Our main goal is to get them that college degree. In that aspect, it’s about time management and project planning. I get their schedules, their syllabi, and we meet twice a week to make sure they’re on schedule for tests and papers. I remind them to do their laundry or their shopping.” She sometimes takes on the role of counselor and confidante, particularly to newly-diagnosed students. “We talk a lot about how much they should disclose to professors or employers about ADHD, and I let them know that their symptoms are common. I give them tools and strategies. The goal is not to have a coach forever, but to get through the tough parts and learn to manage on their own.” Pro Tip: Note-taking, brainstorming, budget and project planning: Get some Evernote templates that are perfect for college students ADHD in adult life One person who can testify to the benefits of coaching is Pete Wright, who shares the podcast with Kinzer. A technologist and educator, Wright was diagnosed with the disorder himself 15 years ago. Evernote made the difference for him, but he concedes that even that was overwhelming at first. Podcast Host Pete Wright “I was one of the early beta users of Evernote,” he says. “Evernote is wide open, and it’s so deep, you can do anything with it. And that can be a huge stumbling block for someone with ADHD.” For Wright, the discussion is always around accomplishing tasks by taking baby steps and a functional approach. “What do you want to accomplish?” Wright asks his podcast listeners. “Notes for college? If you’re always losing pages, leaving them laying around, you’re going to be an absolute disaster for studying. You want to invest in Evernote one issue at a time, and expand from there.” Pro Tip: Organize life and work with an Eisenhower Matrix template for Evernote Focus on the Elephant Wright tells podcast listeners to approach Evernote based on the first problem they need to solve. “If I can’t keep track of my notes, then I use Evernote exclusively for notes. I just need one notebook called “Notes,” and I just want to focus on the little green elephant. I know that’s the function that will be addressed by the elephant.” That singular focus is crucial. Wright explains: “If you can commit to one thing, you’ll be more interested and have more affinity for it. If you have it in your mind that ‘the green elephant means notes,’ you don’t have to think about all the other things that Evernote can do or all the complexity it offers. You don’t have to think about fifty notebooks, you don’t have to think about tags, you only have to think about the elephant.” Kinzer and Wright disagree on the topic of tags in Evernote. Wright swears by them, but Kinzer sees them as a distraction that could set the ADHD mind off course. “I use tags for course IDs of the different classes I teach so that I can isolate all the materials from a particular class at once,” Wright says. Still, he uses them sparingly, and to create context and meaning. Kinzer, on the other hand, doesn’t use them at all. She instead focuses on a methodical use of Evernote that helps build habits, something that is crucial to successful organization with ADHD. “For people with ADHD, out of sight really is out of mind,” Kinzer explains. “People with ADHD don’t intentionally choose not to use the tool that’s going to help them the most, but unless it’s right in front of them, they aren’t going to think about it. Evernote works best if they put everything in it and set it up with a system of reminders, so it’s always in their sight. They have to have something poking at them all the time. So when I work with my clients, I’m always reminding them, ‘did you use the elephant? Did you remember to write it down and put reminders in the elephant?’” “Evernote can change their lives” Kinzer describes the delight her clients feel once they discover that, with the help of Evernote, they can be organized people. “I had a client this week who was doing some remodeling,” she recalls. “I told her about Web Clipper, and it was like Christmas morning. She kept saying, ‘really? I can do that?’ She’d been pulling photos from Instagram and storing them on her phone with photos. But then, she couldn’t find again. There was no organization.” Kinzer sees such scenes again and again as students and adults alike learn to manage their lives in spite of their disorder. “It’s illuminating to see,” she says. “Evernote can change their lives. Once they get one part of it, and it becomes a habit, it can open up a whole new world for them. They don’t have to remember; they don’t have to worry about losing papers, or missing appointments. They only have to think about one thing—whatever they need, it’s in Evernote.” To learn more about how you or a loved one can take control of ADHD, visit Kinzer’s website and sign up for weekly updates.

The same concepts that help us produce work in the office can also help us tackle personal creative projects. Just ask Grant Faulkner , the Executive Director of National Novel Writing Month , a.k.a. NaNoWriMo—the annual challenge where ordinary people commit to writing a 50,000-word story in just 30 days. Evernote is proud to be an official sponsor of this annual creative explosion. Grant has heard all of the excuses we have for not acting on our creative impulses, from a lack of time to the notion that we simply aren’t creative. He demolishes these myths and offers a way forward in his new book, Pep Talks for Writers: 52 Insights & Actions to Boost Your Creative Mojo . Taking Note: Episode 11 — Grant Faulkner http://traffic.libsyn.com/evernote/Taking-Note-11-Grant-Faulkner.mp3 Length: 46 minutes iTunes | SoundCloud | Overcast | MP3 | RSS In this episode of Taking Note , Grant discusses NaNoWriMo, the ways we sabotage our own creative impulses, and how to conquer those inner obstacles to unleash our creative potential—not only in November but all year round. Here are selected highlights from our interview (click the player or download links above to hear the whole thing): Let’s start off with your day gig. You are the executive director of NaNoWriMo, which is something people might have heard of and might be wondering what this funny acronym is all about. Focus on the syllables here. Na is for National, No is for Novel, Wri is for Writing, and Mo is for Month, so National Novel Writing Month. That’s the largest writing event in the world. Last year, we had 312,000 people sign up for it. This year, from our early indicators, we are expecting more. In its most rudimentary form, it’s a challenge to write 50,000 words in the month of November. Just to expand a little bit on why we do this, we believe that everyone in the world has a story to tell. In fact, I just read a survey that 81% of Americans say they would like to someday write a book, but someday doesn’t happen for most of them. We are all about making that dream of ‘someday writing a book’ happen now, through setting a big goal of 50,000 words and having a deadline of 30 days. Those are creative igniters or creative midwives to help people write. how many people actually manage to complete the challenge? About 15% if I was going to pick a one general figure. This year, roughly 45 to 50,000 people will complete a novel, which is huge. Oftentimes people will apologize to me for failing in NaNoWriMo and they’ll say something like, “I only wrote 10,000 words.” Even though some people might not hit 50,000, I don’t want them to think of themselves as failures because if you write 10,000 words in a month, that’s significant. If you do that for 12 months, that’s 120,000 words and that’s a huge novel. I recommend everyone sign up and just give it a shot and don’t quit. If you fall behind on your word count goal, keep going. Just give it a shot and don’t quit. If you fall behind on your goal, keep going. You’ve undoubtedly seen a lot of the challenges that people face when writing projects, especially if they are doing it for the first time. Now, you’ve got this book, Pep Talks for Writers . What prompted you to write the book? One, I talked to a lot of NaNoWriMo writers. I heard a pattern after I’d been here for a few years. I talk to a lot of writers who discovered themselves as writers during NaNoWriMo. They love the NaNoWriMo community. They wanted to keep writing 12 months of the year, but it’s hard to do that. NaNoWriMo is a huge experience and you can make creativity a priority for a month. You can do that in part because you’ve got all these people around you cheering you on, but the next 11 months are more challenging because that community isn’t there in a big way. I really wanted to write something that would help people stay creative every week of the year—hence, 52 essays—and really finish their novel and to take that creative momentum that they’ve established during November and keep it going throughout the year. That was my genesis of the book. Internal challenges and external challenges both exist in abundance. Before we even talk about how we stay in the zone throughout the year, how about just that initial state of inertia we have where you tell people about something like NaNoWriMo or just encourage them to try creative writing and the first thing they say is, “But I’m not a creative person.” I hear that a lot. Two rationalizations of why people can’t do NaNoWriMo. One is “I don’t have enough time.” I hear that most frequently, but the second one I hear and this is the one that actually disturbs me the most is that people will say, “I’m not a creative type.” It hurts me to hear that, actually. We are creators because we are human. We are wired that way. It’s in our genes. To say that you are not a creative type is really shutting down a huge portion of who you are and just not letting it out. You are just limiting yourself, and NaNoWriMo operates on the opposite principle. We are creators because we are human. To say that you are not a creative type is shutting down a huge portion of who you are. You are a writer because you write. You’re a real writer. You don’t have to be published to be a real writer. You are a writer because you write. Creativity for creativity’s sake is good. By participating in NaNoWriMo, by realizing that you are a writer and that you are a creator, you are much more likely to be creative in your everyday life and that means creative as a parent, as a boss, as an employee, as a citizen. That’s the kind of creativity we need to make the world a better place. You point out in the book that inspiration is something that strikes constantly in little, microscopic ways. Every time you write a sentence, each word, each word choice has its own little inspiration. The phrase you use in the book that I really love is, “The muse is conjured in the telling.” Thank you for pointing that out. I actually like that a lot too. I think sometimes we think of inspiration as this big glorious thunderbolt from the sky and that we can’t do anything creative until that somehow kind of strikes us—until we have one of those light bulb moments. You create inspiration when you sit down to write. It might not be the equivalent of one of those thunderbolts, but you are creating. I think inspiration is whispering to you between each word. It’s small, small moments of inspiration and you might not totally recognize it, but it’s happening with each sentence because one sentence spawns another sentence and spawns another sentence. It’s just about getting those words on the page. I like this quote from William Faulkner who said, “I write when inspiration strikes and inspiration strikes every day,” something like that. I think we often stop ourselves from doing something like NaNoWriMo—or any creative project—because we look at other people who are successful artists and we think, “Oh, I can never be like that.” Exactly. I think, especially with the rough draft, too many people will write the first sentence of a novel or first paragraph or even the first chapter and then they’ll go pick up one of their favorite author’s books, or even just any published author. Those books are so polished and perfect. What is not apparent is the number of drafts that the author went through, in excruciating fashion, to get them to that perfect state. And the author had an editor as well, and an agent. I think that that’s a bad way to measure yourself as a writer. Everybody’s rough draft is a crappy rough draft including those award-winning authors. I guarantee you. I wish that some of the big authors in the world would show us their rough drafts because I bet they don’t look too much different than our rough drafts. I recently heard this quote from Barbara Kingsolver and she said that she actually starts at page negative 100. She doesn’t even count the first 100 pages because she is writing just to explore and find her story, and that’s largely what a rough draft is. You have a story in mind and sometimes you might have outlined it in ridiculous detail, but the writing process of that rough draft is still exploratory. If you get hung up on making it perfect, you’ll likely not hit the last page. Let’s talk about this problem of, “Hey, I don’t have enough time to write.” Have you ever met a person who says they are not busy? Our busyness is at least in large part a perception. Obviously, there are a lot of very busy people in the world, but I think sometimes we think we are too busy to do new things or big things. I think if those things are really important to us, if we really want to make creativity a priority for a month to write a novel, we can find a way to do it. I say this from personal experience and dealing with hundreds of writers who I’ve talked to personally. What I do, and I’m just going to give this as a simple tactic for any listener who think that they are too busy, is go on what I call a time hunt. Spend one week of your life keeping track of how [you] spend [your] time. You can do it in 15-minute increments or half hour increments. I think when you do that, you’ll realize how much time you spend on things like social media or binge-watching Netflix, even walking your dog or cooking meals. Some of these things are practical matters of life. Most people can structure their life in a way that will give them the two to three hours a day to write a novel. I need two hours a day, so I cut out social media. I cut a lot on my TV viewing. I make a promise myself to say no to most parties or dinner parties or occasions like that during November and I come up with a strategy where I can find that two to three hours a day to make it work. I think most people can do that. The next step from that, once you’ve made some of those hard choices and you’ve carved out a little bit of time is to get into the habit of using that time. You talk a lot about the importance of routine. I’d like to dig into that. I say in the book that ‘routine’ is another word for ‘muse’ and it goes back to creating your own muse by putting words on the page, just writing regularly. You need to do that to keep creative momentum. If you’re going to drop in on your writing for one or two days a month, it will be hard to like keep the ball rolling. You’ll always be starting from scratch. I think you need to form a routine where you do it regularly and to try structure your life for that. If you’re going to drop in for one or two days a month, it will be hard to like keep the ball rolling. You’ll always be starting from scratch. Stephen King in his book On Writing , which I highly recommend, has a nice passage on routine. He takes it further than I do, because he likes the idea of routine where you go to one place every day and at that one place, your ideal desk, say, you are picking up signals. It’s like when you lie down in your bed at night, your brain is like deciding to go to sleep and picking up all the cues to go to sleep. Stephen King said the same thing with routine. He says, “If you sit down at your desk at the same time every day, you are getting your mind ready to go back into the story.” Maybe we can’t all carve out two hours like you mentioned every day, but even if you’ve only carve out a little bit of time to write in a routine manner, it really adds up. If you can write 250 words a day, that’s 7,500 words a month. At the end of the year, you’ve got a good sized novel’s worth of writing done. 90,000 words, isn’t that amazing? I’m a working parent and a writer in addition to my day job. Especially when I became a parent, I had to totally change. It totally changed my writing life. My routine was not as expansive and as glorious and as regular as I might have liked. I had to strategize and look for the nooks and crannies of the day, the 10 minutes here or the 15 minutes there where I could write that 250 words. As long as you are keeping your juices alive, I think that’s what’s mainly important. I’m going to tell just one little story on this note, which I’ve always found this very inspirational. Toni Morrison, she was a single working mom living in New York City. She didn’t have much time. After she finished the homework with them and got them to bed, she literally had about 15 minutes before she went to bed herself. In that 15 minutes, which was like the worst creative time in her whole day, that’s where she wrote her first novel. Just 15 minutes a day. We can get into the trap where we are engaged in fake productivity. We are having activity, but we are not actually moving forward. What are some examples of that? Some people can spend their whole lifetime researching a novel. I think writers, you need to know where to strike that balance. Do you really need to research everything before starting? I think generally the answer is no. I think it’s best to write the story and go for it and then look for what you need. You need to do a certain amount of research to feel confident about the topic depending on what the topic is, but then there’s a lot of research you can do afterwards. I think things like that become rationalizations of why you are not going to write. For me, before I did NaNoWriMo I wrote with a kind of ponderous preciousness. I would have to get that first chapter or those first two or three chapters just perfect before I could move on. I was just spending an inordinate amount of time tweaking sentences and cutting and pasting things. I really wasn’t moving the novel forward. That’s where there was fake productivity for me. I was doing a lot of work and a lot of tweaking, but I wasn’t really moving that much closer to the end point. It also made the time I spent on each section of the novel very skewed, like I might spend 50 or 60 percent of my time on the first act and 20 or 30 percent on the second act and then barely any time on the ending. One reason I think the productivity of NaNoWriMo is really good is because you are constantly focusing on moving the story forward and progressing. You can measure it in the words you write every day, your word count. What about writer’s block? I know you’ve said there’s no such thing. If there is no writer’s block, what is going on in our heads? I say that. I know it’s controversial to some people. I tweeted that a few months ago and I got a lot of flak from certain people. Writer’s block is this sort of accepted notion and I don’t think it should be such an accepted notion. I think there’s a lot mythology build up around it. The stereotype of the author who hasn’t written in years and years. I think that writer’s block is largely self-imposed. It’s largely a story you tell yourself. You tell yourself that story when you’re not writing, when you’re not sitting in front of your laptop or in front of your Moleskine journal. That’s where the NaNoWriMo word sprints come in so handy. You can write in a burst for five minutes and it doesn’t have to be perfect. You are not supposed to even revise the grammar or anything, just get the words out. I think when you put one sentence on a piece of paper, it leads to a second sentence and a third. It’s just about getting some words down and it’s amazing what happens. During those word sprints, it taps into a mysterious part of our brains. We are not planning the words to write or the story we are going to write. It just comes. It only really comes if you’re writing. It’s not going to come if you’re sitting there staring out the window. It’s really about sitting down and just putting some words down and you can start out with just absurdities. You can start with a few observations. It doesn’t have to be about your novel. The thing is just to start writing. It only really comes if you’re writing. It’s not going to come if you’re sitting there staring out the window. I tend to agree with you. I’ve certainly had many periods, sometimes very lengthy periods, when I’m not doing any writing at all. And I’ve had periods when I write myself into a corner and don’t know how to get out. But that’s not the same thing as being blocked. I think when you give the thing a name, you give it power over yourself. It becomes this external agency: “Oh, it’s not me. There’s this thing. There’s this writer’s block that is stopping me.” That’s exactly it, I think. When you give it a name, you give it power. There’s no reason to give it that power. There are so many ways around it. You can, as you say, just write some nonsense, just freestyle it for a while, just do a sprint or you could skip ahead in your story if you have an idea of where you’re going. You don’t have to write the next scene next. Exactly. I recommend a lot of skipping. I love skipping ahead or back a lot. I was going to also say that one of the chapters in Pep Talks goes through Ray Bradbury’s process when he first became a writer. He did this cool thing where he would write just 20 nouns down and they would be random. Then, he would write what he called little pensées , little 100 or 200 word tiny essays about each word. By doing that, he would find his story and actually some of his most famous books came from that process. There are so many different ways to inspire yourself out of writer’s block. You can grab pictures on the internet and put them in Evernote. I did that with one novel to have some visual images to guide my novel. I think there’s just a lot of cool ways to not accept writer’s block. I have one more thing I wanted to ask about and this is also from your book. The concept that we are going to fail, but when we fail, the key is to fail better. What do you mean by that? I think there are a lot of different ways to interpret ‘failing better.’ At its most fundamental, failing better means actually seeking failure out by taking risks. The best novels take risks. The author is opening up his or her heart in a way that helps us connect with the story and that’s a risk. There’s something like beyond that for writing because I think it was Philip Roth who said like a really good baseball player hits the ball 30 percent of the time and that stat goes for a writer as well. Most of your sentences, especially in that rough draft, are going to be misses or they’re going to need improvement. I think you have to accept that to start, accept that you’re going to miss the ball more than you’re going to hit it. Then, think about ways to learn from that failure, to keep going and to still be open to taking risks. Accept that you’re going to miss the ball more than you’re going to hit it. Then, think about ways to learn from that failure. It’s a growth mindset that when you recognize something as a ‘failure,’ you are not shutting the door and saying you’re a bad writer and you should stop. You need to tell yourself that being a good writer takes practice. Ray Bradbury actually said, “To be a good writer, you have to write several thousand or hundred thousand throwaway words.” That’s one thing I tell people with NaNoWriMo, especially the beginning writers. You’ve got to write one novel, two novels, three novels to really learn how to write a novel sometimes. Most people don’t get it on the first shot. It’s rare. It’s wonderful when that happens, but it’s rare. This is the nature of art or any creative endeavor. You fail more than you succeed, but you can cultivate that growth mindset and succeed a little more often or when you do fail, fail better. There’s also the premise that more ideas are better than fewer ideas. Getting more ideas leads to more likely success. I like quoting this story that there was a study by a ceramics professor. Let me think if I can remember this. Half of his class was graded on if they could just make one perfect pot or ceramic piece. The other half of the class was graded on the weight, the volume of things they produced. What the teacher found was that the students who produced for quantity, what they produced was actually better than those who were focused on the quality of one piece. That’s because they were taking a lot of risks and they were open and they were accepting failure. They didn’t care. Evernote is proud to be a sponsor of National Novel Writing Month.

And while this year’s most popular gifts for kids were perennially favorite toys, the… ahem, big kids looked to high tech to make their holiday dreams come true. Instead of sugarplums, many grown-ups had visions of Apple iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch, and Amazon Echo (a.k.a. Alexa) dancing in their heads. If you were lucky enough to receive one of these gadgets this year, we have some good news for you: they all play well with Evernote. Thanks to some handy integrations—and a little help from our friends—you can capture and search your ideas wherever you go. To make sure you’re getting the most out of these devices, here are a few tips to get you started. Have a tête-à-tête with Siri If you received an iPhone or iPad as a holiday gift, you probably want to take all its bells and whistles for a test drive. One of the most powerful features is Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant. Evernote is integrated with Siri so you can stay productive even when you’re busy doing other things. Create a shopping list on your iPad while you’re making breakfast. Add to-dos to Evernote on your iPhone while you’re stuck in traffic. Use your EarPods while you’re working out to tell Siri to create a note. Here’s how it works: Awaken Siri on your device and then give your instructions directly to Evernote. It’s that simple. Try one of these commands today and see for yourself: “Create a note in Evernote called Meeting Ideas,” or “Create a note called Meeting Ideas in Evernote.” “Add ‘I should bring pizza’ to my Meeting Ideas note in Evernote.” “Create a list in Evernote with ‘Order lunch’ and ‘Make itinerary,’” or “Create a list with ‘Order lunch’ and ‘Make itinerary’ in Evernote.” “Show me the notes I created today in Evernote.” You don’t even need to touch your device to create, add to, and search your notes, so you’ll be ready when your next brilliant idea comes along. It’s time for Evernote and Apple Watch If you’re the proud owner of an Apple Watch, be sure to add the Evernote app to both your watch and your iOS device. Evernote and Apple Watch work together (and are considered a single device in your account) to help you organize and find things when you’re really on the go. How? Record audio from your wrist. Now that sounds like James Bond, doesn’t it? But you don’t have to make a secret of it. Recording audio with Evernote for Apple Watch is more convenient, and a little bit more subtle than pulling out your iPhone or iPad. A perfect way to use it? Record discreetly into Evernote when you’re in a class or lecture, or if you have to interview someone. Just remember to get the speaker’s permission to record—unless it’s you. Recording your own voice so you never have to let an idea or a reminder escape you is one of the most popular ways to use Evernote with Apple Watch. Jot it down. Nobody’s suggesting you should write a novel in a 38 or 42mm form with your finger, but you can put bits of information into a note. Phone numbers, a simple sketch, or your parking space number are good choices. A third hand. You need to give the baby some medicine, but you also need dosing instructions. And your hands are full of…baby. Good thing you put those instructions in Evernote. Now you can just glance at them on your wrist while your hands are full. Secrets for using Evernote with Amazon Echo Popular gifts this year are Amazon Echo devices, sometimes called Alexa. If you’re new to having an always-on assistant in your home, you’re in for a treat. While Alexa doesn’t yet have Evernote Skills, you can still make Alexa and Evernote talk to one another. Visit IFTTT. If you’re not super-technical, all you need to know is that IFTTT helps one bit of tech communicate with another. Tell IFTTT that you want to Add Your Alexa to-do’s to Evernote , export your shopping list , or keep track of songs Alexa plays for you in Evernote , and the code will take care of the rest. Looking to the future: Google (and more) await It’s clear by now that the prevailing trend in personal tech is toward greater connectivity and deeper integration between devices and services. In that spirit, new gadgets are entering the market on what seems like a daily basis. One of the most highly publicized recent releases is Google Home—a device aimed squarely at Amazon Echo’s share of the market. For now, Evernote is not integrated with Google Home, but rest assured that, as with our Siri and Apple Watch partnerships, we’ll be looking at ways of bringing full Evernote functionality to this and other gadgets in the not-too-distant future. Congratulations on your new gadgets. Be sure to use them wisely—and productively—with Evernote.", "date": "2017-12-27,"},

We recently caught up with Aaron Mahnke, author and host of the wildly popular and frankly hair-raising podcast “Lore.” Aaron talked about how the power of storytelling and a dash of Evernote helped fuel his passion. Nothing beats a great story. Storytelling has helped create our connection to others as long as we’ve been able to communicate. Aaron Mahnke has used this centuries-old technique to forge an entirely new career path. A successful author, he has made a fascinating turn into podcasting. Lore was downloaded more than six million times in October 2016 alone, and was named “Best of 2015” by iTunes. Lore features spooky tales that have fueled our collective superstitions, everything from asylums to vampires. Tapping into our collective fears Stories have staying power. They weave themselves into the cultural fabric. Folkloric traditions, many handed down through generations, spark our imagination, illustrate a point of view, evoke emotion and delight, and share observations. Stories can also scare the living hell out of us. People love to be scared. Whether it’s a horror film on the big screen of a cineplex, or the mounting dread of a Stephen King novel, we’re compelled to the spooky and drawn to the fearsome . “There’s something to be said for the sharp emotions that we feel when we’re frightened. Being scared by something has a way of making us feel alive,” Aaron says. “Superstitions have a way of helping us explain the things we don’t understand. Together, these tales help us get a better grip on our lives, our reality, and the experiences we have as individuals.” Aaron has had a lifelong fascination with the supernatural. It was fueled at an early age by a fifth-grade short story assignment for Halloween that married creative writing and the weird. The tale he told is not for the faint of heart. In it, a young boy unearths a pumpkin only to discover that the festive gourd was full of bones, absorbed from the soil of a forgotten burial ground. For Aaron, this macabre tale was an easy task. “It was like being given a bucket of quarters and free access to a video arcade. I was in heaven,” Aaron recalls. In a way, this story was the proving ground for the types of work that would help to define his career, not just as a writer, but also a spoken-word storyteller. Listen closely A podcast is the perfect medium for ethereal tales and all things spooky and terrifying. They harken to a period—not so long ago yet distant in our imaginations—when families would gather around the radio and listen to shows that depended on the audience’s imagination to be effective. This American Life, a weekly public radio show, helped lay the foundation for a new wave of engaging, original storytelling beginning in 1995. More recently, their spinoff show Serial helped take podcasting to renewed popularity. It’s a powerful confluence that has ushered the almost-forgotten medium of audio back to vanguard status. Much like Aaron’s work on Lore , many people are experimenting with new approaches, business models, and ideas through podcasting. Podcasting has become a compelling way to advance the narrative and explore storytelling. With production revolving primarily around narration and audio elements, listeners are forced to visualize stories in an entirely new light. It’s like gathering around the campfire under evening stars to hear a ghost story, only it happens in the car or the gym, and, for most of us, in solitude. Each episode, which comes out bi-weekly, features a long-forgotten, true story, underscored by the podcast’s tagline: Because sometimes, truth is more frightening than fiction. These tales have been curated by Aaron over the space of several years and maintained in a living document — and this collection serves as the impetus for Lore . Nearly all of them are mythical and folkloric, dealing with everything from hauntings and nefarious activities to cryptozoological beasts. The stories are cobbled from places like the magical and mysterious Northeastern United States, and the dark forests and gothic graveyards of Europe and the United Kingdom. Together, they explore the roots of our fears and their place in history. Putting the pieces together Aaron spends a lot of time working on Lore. In addition to running the business side of podcasting (marketing, promoting, and growing his audience), Aaron has a big role in researching, producing, writing, hosting, and editing every episode. Writing and editing alone account for a major effort. “Each episode takes me maybe 12 hours to write and edit,” Aaron says. “After that, another three to four hours of recording and production before it’s ready for public consumption.” All in all, more than 30 hours of work are required across every step of the process to create a single episode. Recently, Aaron hired a research assistant to help him with the initial stages of that process. “She’s wonderful, and tracks down the right reading material, saving me the time I would have spent on exploration and dead ends,” he says. There’s also the occasional opportunity to collaborate with other creative folks. He tapped Chad Lawson , a composer and pianist (and passionate Evernote user) to help score the opening music of the podcast. Chad also helped with music for an upcoming live show in Boston. Write. Every. Day. While many writers argue about their methods, rituals, and traditions when it comes to writing, Aaron strives to write every day. “I’ve always held to the advice that a writer should write every day. It’s a lot like exercise. When you run once a month, your body never has a chance to get used to the stress and build endurance. You can’t make improvements and grow. And I treat writing the same way,” he says. “I write for about four hours each morning. It’s how I start my day before anything else intrudes. Of course, I have that luxury because I do this for a living.” He remembers a time when such freedom was unavailable to him. “Before, writing was a thing I squeezed into the cracks in my life. Evenings after the kids went to bed. Lunch breaks. I’ve tried everything, all with the goal of just making sure I can write a few hundred words each day.” “We put writing up on this pedestal as some sort of creative magic,” Aaron says. “Many writers are bound up in ritual and atmosphere. Things have to be just right. But when we treat writing like some sort of unicorn we need to capture, we tack on all sorts of baggage and stress. Writing is creative, yes, but it’s also work. It’s just a task.” The future will be televised Aaron’s work on Lore has received so much attention that it will soon become an hour-long television series , produced by Amazon. The show will be an anthology of the tales that made the podcast popular, each offering a mixture of narration, mixed media, and cinematic shooting. “Amazon has taken a risk on a new kind of hybrid show that’s going to push the envelope in so many ways. I think at least part of the continuity, at least from my side of things, will stem from using the same tools and methods that I already use on the podcast.” So far, Aaron has discovered that the process, techniques, and writing methods he uses for the podcast have transitioned smoothly to the medium of television. Fans clamoring for a preview will be excited to learn that the same unnerving elements that cemented the success of his podcast will be present in the unscripted television series set to premiere in 2017. Behind the scenes , Aaron is teaming up with executive producer Gale Anne Hurd, who works on The Walking Dead , and Glen Morgan, a producer and writer for The X-Files . Viewers can expect the television show to highlight  the “frightening, psychologically disturbing and paranormal true events that spawn our modern-day nightmares,” Hurd announced at New York ComicCon. Tool of the trade From successful businessman to multi-platform producer, Evernote occupies an important place in Aaron’s workflow. For a long time, the app served as a sort of storage locker — a place where Aaron stored links, images, notes, scraps, and ideas into clearly-labeled notebooks. It was what he called a “someday box.” That someday box has evolved into a reliable engine that fuels Lore’s daily workflow. The tool that got him over the proverbial hump? Evernote Web Clipper . In addition to clipping, Aaron builds a number of Evernote features into his process, including marking up PDFs, tagging , and a multi-layered, interconnected notebook system that ties together all the elements of his research and writing. “It’s a process that sounds simple on paper: I pick a topic I find interesting, and then research every aspect of it that I can,” Aaron explains. “I read for hours, taking notes and highlighting pieces of story or information. And when I’ve filled my head with everything, I find a quiet place and think through the outline. A lot of that happens in Evernote.” If you’re wondering what Aaron’s tagging system looks like, we’ll just have to leave you with a bit of… mystery.

But for abstract artist Marta Spendowska , it can be as subtle as the line between two shades of blue. Marta’s vibrant, atmospheric art and design are all about the interplay and harmony of color. Off the canvas, she brings the same notions of interplay and harmony to a creative organization system built in Evernote. “I can honestly say I use Evernote 10 to 50 times a day,” Marta told us in a recent interview. “My life and work happens in Evernote; it’s my own personal encyclopedia.” “My life and work happens in Evernote; it’s my own personal encyclopedia.” Marta’s life is a dance between detailed structure and spontaneous expression. As she says on her website: “As an illustrator I know my exact steps: research the topic, collect references, decide on palette, respond to the client’s requirements. But as an artist, I am at the mercy of beauty and spirituality… I have come to recognize them as twin sisters.” “Small miracles” captured over time Evernote allows Marta to merge her drive towards order with the fluid abstraction of her art. Working in watercolors, acrylic paint, and ink—all water-based media that can do unexpected things on canvas—Marta often comes across surprising combinations.  “I tend to discover happenings on canvas I haven’t intended,” she said. “These are small miracles I possibly would like to replicate. The only way for me to remember it for the future is to create a reference in Evernote and describe it while the paint is drying, making notes of the ratio of pigment to pigment.” In the note shown above, Marta documented a striking effect she discovered while exploring mixed blues. She photographed it and noted exactly how she got there: “Here: teal blue/water, white powder w/water, after dry a bit, swamp green w/white spirits.” All these snapshots go into a “Process Art” notebook, where Marta records every stage of her work in progress. Later, she can go back to her notes and see how an individual work evolved over time. A spectrum of notebooks Keeping her process documented in Evernote is just the beginning. “I use IFTTT to stream my Instagram posts right to Evernote,” she says. “This way I have all my blogging and social media images under one roof. And anytime someone mentions my name online the posts are collected in a ‘Mentioned’ notebook. That’s useful for PR.” Yet another notebook, called “Color Trends,” is used to save Pantone swatches, scraps of paint, and examples of current design thinking. Marta turns to her notebooks when discussing commissions with clients, to cross-reference artworks with galleries, and even to record her dreams through audio notes. Marta’s process notes link to the high-resolution images she stores on Dropbox, and she also adds note links to her to-do lists in OmniFocus. The result is a tight web of ideas where inspiration and reference materials are always close at hand. “Without Evernote, I’d have to keep all these documents with embedded images, detailed notes describing what is stored where… this would mean two things—inefficiency and wasted time,” she says. “Evernote is a powerful virtual assistant, keeping me organized and fast at work. I’m discovering new ideas for using it every day.” You can find Marta online at verymarta.com or follow her on Instagram @martaspendowska", "date": "2016-01-22,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "One Key Reason Your Resolutions Will Probably Fail—And What to Do About It", "author": ["Michael Hyatt"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/one-reason-your-resolutions-will-probably-fail/", "abstract": "It’s the season for New Year’s resolutions. Wharton School researchers say we’re inclined to look forward to new and important goals around significant points on the calendar, such as the start of a new year. They call it the “fresh-start effect.” The bad news is that the effect doesn’t last very long. According to one poll , four in ten Americans usually set resolutions at the start of the year. Another two in ten do it at least some years. But fewer than ten percent actually succeed. Most of us can keep our resolutions a few weeks, but not even half are still going by midyear. There are a lot of reasons for the drop-off. For one, resolutions are usually vague. Goals like get healthy , lose weight , and save more money are too abstract to mean very much. Absent the saliency of the “fresh start effect,” it’s tough staying emotionally connected to these goals. Another reason is that sometimes our resolutions are oughts, not wants. They’re things we’re supposed to do, but really don’t desire. We want other things more, so our resolutions fall by the wayside. Resolutions fail because we don’t really believe we can succeed. There are a half dozen other reasons just like these, and they all have an effect on our ability to stick to goals. But one reason that often gets overlooked is this: We don’t really believe we can succeed. Beware the goal toxin According to the poll I mentioned above, vastly more people in their twenties achieve their resolutions compared to those over fifty. And a Harris Poll discovered that people are far more likely to consider resolutions a “waste of time” the older they are; more than two-thirds of people over 65 think they’re pointless. Why? One of the ways we brace ourselves against disappointment is to stop getting our hopes up. And after decades of setbacks and failures, many people doubt a better future is possible. (For younger people, the relative lack of experience is actually a benefit!) But if you believe your dream is impossible—or even just improbable—you won’t take the necessary action to bring your dream to life. Why bother? Either you won’t even start, or you won’t give it your all. Resolutions fail because we don’t believe we can succeed. As I detail in my new book, Your Best Year Ever , doubt is a goal toxin. You already know all the signs. Here are a few examples: The job market is terrible. I’ll never land something better. I’ll never lose this weight. I’ve had it for years. My marriage is stuck, and my spouse doesn’t even care. I can’t shake this addiction. Life is just too stressful. I’ve never been good with money. I can barely stay ahead of my bills. Hope for something better might dawn with the new year, but then we settle down into disbelief soon thereafter. All those thoughts add up to disengagement, failure, and more disappointment. No surprise at the end of the year people are still stuck in jobs they hate, feeling unhealthy, unhappy, and broke. It’s predictable. You get what you expect I know some people believe in the Law of Attraction. But there’s a much simpler explanation for how our beliefs affect our experience of the future: We tend to experience what we expect. Our expectations shape what we believe is possible. In 1928, sociologist William Thomas said, “If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.” 20 years later, another sociologist, Robert Merton, reflected on the Thomas Theorem and coined the term “self-fulfilling prophecy.” Karl Popper, the philosopher of science, called this the “Oedipus Effect,” after the mythic Greek hero whose life fulfilled a tragic prophecy. Our expectations shape what we believe is possible. In turn, these expectations and beliefs shape our perceptions and actions. That means they also shape the outcomes. And that means they shape our reality. A simple exercise to change direction We have a whole range of beliefs about the world, others, and ourselves that limit us. Real change starts with upgrading these beliefs. I detail a process in Your Best Year Ever , but the basics are as simple as this. (By the way, you can do this exercise with a sheet of paper or open up a new note in Evernote. Draw a line down the page to create two columns or start a table in a note.) Think about something you want for the new year—something for you, for your family; something material, emotional, spiritual, whatever. Ask: What prevents you from getting it? Write down your answers in the left column. Now challenge them. Are they accurate? Are they overblown? Are they helpful? What would you do differently if those answers were false? Reject what answers you can and try to reframe the rest so there’s room for possibility. In the right column, write down new or revised beliefs that are more accurate and more helpful. Working with the examples above: Limiting beliefs Liberating truths The job market is terrible. I’ll never land something better. I’ve got the right skills for the job I need. I just need to get creative in selling myself. I’ll never lose this weight. I’ve had it for years. I’ve been carrying this weight too long. Someone can help me lose it. My marriage is stuck, and my spouse doesn’t even care. My marriage will only be as good as my attitude. I can be responsible for myself, and I can change. I can’t shake this addiction. Life is just too stressful. I hate feeling this way. There are better ways of dealing with stress. I’ve never been good with money. I can barely stay ahead of my bills. I’ve got all the money I need for the basics, and I can build on that. Whatever you write in your right-hand column, consider these new liberating truths your personal manifesto for achieving your goals. A resolution is only as good as the belief behind it. Adopting a new sense of what’s possible is the first step in experiencing your best year ever. And the good news is whatever setbacks or disappointment you might have suffered to date, they don’t define your future. Only you can do that.

{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Guts, Glory, and Evernote: Extreme Athlete Writes the Book on the Marathon des Sables", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/guts-glory-evernote-extreme-athlete-writes-book-marathon-des-sables/", "abstract": "In the blistering heat and never-ending sand dunes of the Sahara Desert, the bravest, fittest souls in the world look across the vast, terrifying expanse and see only challenge and opportunity. For them, the six-day, 156-mile (251 km) annual race across the unforgiving Moroccan desert known as the Marathon des Sables (MdS) is the ultimate test of stamina and endurance, and thousands sign up every year—but only a few complete it. You might not expect to count a British management consultant among that number, but Nisha Harish is someone who made it. Like all MdS participants, she carried with her everything she needed for survival in temperatures that can reach 134 degrees F (56.6 degrees C) in the daytime and drop to 35 degrees F (1.6 degrees C) at night—food, water, safety supplies, a sleeping bag, and medical equipment. Nisha also carried an iPhone and the Evernote app, determined to continue writing her book about her experiences while running the race. Competitors trek across the Sahara in “the toughest footrace on earth” Grueling training for the ‘toughest footrace on earth’ Nisha was making her second attempt at the race. The first time, logistical errors cost her nine toenails. Ultimately, this meant that she was unable to complete the race. Undeterred, she came back the following year (2015), this time armed with the wisdom of experience and a backpack that was half the weight of her original. She also trained on the Dune du Pilat in Bordeaux, France, the highest sand dune in Europe. On weekends, she hiked and trained outside of London on unforgiving, hilly terrain. Nisha said, “At the peak of my training I was running 100 miles (160 km) a week, carrying 22 pounds (10 kg) of weight on my back. All the while I was structuring my book in Evernote. I crafted the book into 12 chapters and made a notebook for each chapter. Within each notebook, I captured notes and pictures that I’d use in that chapter.” It would be too simplistic to say that Evernote allows people to make notes because it has allowed me to achieve a major life ambition. —Nisha Harish Life-or-death consequences for small decisions The race itself is even more grueling than it sounds. Runners have to be completely prepared to run the equivalent of a full marathon a day for six days in harsh desert conditions. Nisha saw fellow competitors go down with broken bones, ruptured intestines, foot infections, and even temporary blindness. Each participant must make life-changing decisions about how much weight to carry, balancing their needs against the merciless demands of the route. “The more a runner carries, the slower he or she will be,” Nisha advised. “The slower the runner, the higher the risk of missing the time limits stipulated at each checkpoint, and the longer the runner will have to spend on their feet. The more time spent on their feet, the more likely it will be to sustain an injury. All runners have to weigh the consequences versus the benefits of what we carry.” Nisha learned this lesson the hard way in 2014, the first time she attempted the MdS. “I carried 33 pounds (15 kg) of equipment and supplies in my rucksack because I over-estimated how much I would need. The extra weight made it incredibly painful to race a full marathon every day. In 2015, I reduced this to 17.5 pounds (8 kg) which meant that I was much quicker and sustained far fewer injuries due to less pressure on my joints and feet.” Author, athlete, and Evernote user Nisha Harish Crafting a book in Evernote Nisha captured tips like these at night, tapping out notes in Evernote on her iPhone while in her tent. “I could capture my thoughts, feelings, and experiences in Evernote, right when they were happening, so they’d be more real than writing them later from memory. Psychologically, it felt more like texting to do it that way, more than writing a whole book,” she explained. “I knew I wanted to write the sort of book I needed to read before I ran the race for the first time. It needed to be part inspirational, and part guide; I wanted to write something to help others run the race successfully. But I didn’t like the idea of writing at my laptop in solitary confinement. I wanted to write a book, but it needed to fit into my lifestyle. Evernote gave me that flexibility.” Nisha’s book, Big Steps, Long Strides , combines her story with practical advice, ranging from training strategies to dealing with injuries. The book includes a foreword written by the renowned explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes , who at 71 years old in 2015, became the oldest Brit to complete the race. Today, back at home in London, Nisha has embarked on an additional strand to her career as a keynote speaker. “When I tell people about Evernote, and I illustrate the way I used it, they’re amazed and engaged by the story—but also by the app. It would be too simplistic to say that Evernote allows people to make notes because it has allowed me to achieve a major life ambition.”", "date": "2016-05-8,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "How Evernoters Use Evernote: Alie’s Whirlwind of Activity", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/how-evernoters-use-evernote-alie/", "abstract": "If you looked at Alie Bui’s daily schedule, you’d think she has more hours in the day than the rest of us. Alie is both a center of calm and a bundle of energy. Outside of her formidable duties at Evernote, she’s a jeweler. A metalsmith. A craftswoman who dabbles in everything from resin casting to soap-making to creating natural fabric dyes. A bartender. A floral arranger. A baker. A fitness instructor. A nationally-qualified bodybuilder. And with her brothers, she supports her family. She’s also a marketing project manager at Evernote. And of course, at the heart of this whirlwind of activity is Evernote. “I’m really a low-tech person,” Alie observes. “I have a phone and a laptop. I don’t have other electronics.” She shows her iPhone and flips through only two pages of apps. “Half of these I don’t even use,” she said, with a touch of consternation in her voice. “I use Facebook, Instagram, Yelp, Spotify, Evernote, and Slack. That’s it.” It is perhaps the fact that she’s a tech minimalist, even in the Silicon Valley environment that thrives on it, that gives her the time she uses to pursue her many avocations and jobs. “I have to think about how I allocate my time,” she says, putting away her phone and never taking it out again throughout the interview. “I don’t multi-task. I manage time by focusing only on what’s in front of me. When I go to they gym, I have my set routine, and I use a note I’ve drawn up with my exercises for each day. I go through the note, and I’m in and out of the gym.” As a fitness instructor, Alie teaches barre, which is a ballet-based workout that’s gaining popularity across America. As she does with her own workout, Alie structures her classes in advance with Evernote, where she’s able to take note of the individuals in her class and their particular limitations, so that she can come up with variations immediately, and it looks effortless. “I have a template for the structure of my classes,” she explains. “In each class, there’s a cadence for how things are done. There are certain standards that ensure you don’t overwork any part of your body. So my template shows me the exercise and the benefit. The Benefit column gives me encouragement points,  and the music and the goal are at the top so that when I go to class, I have everything ready for me at a glance.” A sample of Alie’s workout routine in Evernote From the barre to the bar Passionate about fitness since she was a teenager, Alie observed that her grandmother’s physical activity is tied to her social life, which in turn is tied to her living quality. “Childhood obesity is on the rise,” says Alie, who recently placed among the top 5 female bodybuilders in multiple competitions. “It’s not really a secret that this generation is heavier than previous ones. But my grandma went to hula and tai chi and had a garden, and I attribute her long life to that. Health just makes people’s lives better.” Fitness, however, doesn’t keep Alie away from bartending and baking. “Evernote is the perfect recipe storing unit,” she advises. Before coming to Evernote, Alie was a bartender who specialized in domestic spirits. “I worked at a bar where we could create drinks that would be on the seasonal menu,” she remembers. “We could make up our own ingredients, so I was coming in and making homemade grenadine or amaretto, and I’d keep the recipes in Evernote. I’d keep it on my phone so that if I’d be out and I saw an ingredient I thought I might need when I went to work, I could grab it quickly and be ready.” She also kept tasting notes in Evernote, so she could make instant recommendations and appear to have a photographic memory of hundreds of spirits. A rock-solid methodology Alie’s custom jewelry business is one of her newer endeavors. She’s teaching herself how to become a metalsmith, and learning about semi-precious stones as she travels to rock shops throughout the Southwest on weekends and holidays. One of the first things she learned: stones for jewelry are small, and can get lost easily. “I’ve lost a few items, so I got smarter about that,” Alie says. “It’s a good way to lose money really fast. Now,” she adds, “I  keep my designs in Evernote, along with pictures of stones, so that way I don’t have to carry a pocket full of unfinished pieces. “If I want to find stones or a chain that matches a design, I have a visual representation with me all the time, so I can see if stones, settings, and chains will work well together.” Sourcing her pieces, Alie relies on Evernote’s geotagging feature, which tells her not only the content of the note but where she took it. “If I forgot where I bought a bead or a rock, but I’d taken a picture of it, I can call up the photo, and it will remind me exactly where I got it.” Marketing her pieces online, Alie turns to Instagram. All of her photos typically get hundreds of ‘likes,’ and the strategy behind such engagement is tracking the time of day she posts pictures and keeping records of hashtags she frequently uses in Evernote. She’s discovered, through meticulous tracking, that more people interact with the photos of her jewelry between 9 PM and 11 PM. “Hashtags has been trial and error,” she says. “You can type words in and see how many times they’ve been used, and then I latch onto hashtags that are popular at the moment. The next time, I’ll also see how a particular hashtag performed in the past to decide whether I want to use it again.” To make tagging quicker, Alie keeps a list of her best-performing hashtags in Evernote and copies and pastes them into Instagram. Evernote for romantics Speaking of rocks, on the day Alie spoke to us, she was wearing a new one: an engagement ring. She had just said ‘yes,’ and was both excited and demure about the news. “We do sappy stuff in Evernote,” she confessed. “We have a shared notebook called ‘Adulting,’ and we both write down all the things we want to do in the future in it. We note down roadside attractions we want to visit, games we want to play. We surprise each other by dropping event tickets into the notebook for the other to find.” He also keeps a secret note that Alie can’t access that lists all the presents he wants to give her. Alie and her friends also have fun with Evernote. Her favorite is a progressive story where they take turns writing 250 words at a time. “We aren’t allowed to talk about it, those are the rules,” Alie says with a smile. “We do our 250 words, then pass it on in Work Chat. The next person adds their 250 words to the story. It’s a fun way to interact.” Her impromptu story game is now at 20,000 words, and going strong. The secret sauce All of her daily paperwork—bills, documents, assignments, calendars, and tasks—goes straight into Evernote the moment she gets them. “People underestimate the search function,” Alie observes. “That’s because it becomes more amazing if you put a lot of stuff into Evernote in the first place. But once you’ve moved everything you need to remember into it, it’s invaluable. “If I didn’t have Evernote, I don’t know where I’d put all my stuff. I’d be spacey and all over the place, and I’m not a ‘gadgety’ person,” Alie says. “My energy level and passion help, but as far as being successful in all the things I do, Evernote has a lot to do with that. If I’m on my computer, I’m probably in Evernote.”", "date": "2017-06-2,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Bring Precious Memories Back to Life with Digital Scrapbooking", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/bring-precious-memories-back-life-digital-scrapbooking/", "abstract": "We’ve been telling you for years that Evernote can help you “remember everything.” And we really do mean everything—Evernote isn’t only for your work notes, checklists, and important documents. Hobbies need organization and productivity too. Exhibit A: Linda Rith, queen of digital scrapbooking with Evernote. Scrapbooking has come a long way from the days of gluing photographs and ticket stubs into an empty book. As one of the most popular crafts in the world, scrapbooking supports a whole industry—acid-free ribbons, stickers, frames, tape, and more all go into creating themed memory pages. But scrapbookers like Linda have taken the concept even further with digital editions of these pages, complete with decoration, stored in Evernote. An Evernote scrapbook can go everywhere, hold everything, and is instantly searchable. Building a hyper-collage Linda, a technical writer at Evernote by day, has been scrapbooking for years. Getting started is easy: “Start with a simple photo editing program,” she advises. “I use Photoshop, but you can also use Photoshop Elements , which is less expensive, or you can use some free apps that are available online as a Photoshop alternative.” Linda cautions that working with Photoshop for scrapbooking requires a little bit of technical proficiency with the product, but there are a lot of YouTube tutorials out there for getting started. “Everyone is familiar with putting photos into a collage to share to social media,” she says. “Digital scrapbooking takes the idea one step further. This is a hyper-collage.” Digital scrapbooking includes the same elements as traditional scrapbooks: flowers, ribbons, stickers, decorative papers, and blurbs of text to describe photos and experiences. In the digital version, these elements come in the form of .png files available from kits. “My favorites are online stores like The Lilypad, Sweetshop Designs , and Brittish Designs , Linda says. “Start by setting your page to 3600 x 3600 pixels at 300 dpi, and then you can just open a kit and add the elements you like.” Linda is a die-hard Disney fan, so many of her scrapbook pages take a Disney theme as she chronicles her trips to Disney parks. Here’s where digital scrapbooking takes on a whole new dimension: unlike a traditional scrapbook, a digital scrapbook can link to web pages or videos. “I love the Red Car Newsboys ,” she says. “I took a video of the show, uploaded it to YouTube, then created a QR code for the scrapbook. I added a note that scanning the code will open the video of the performance.” PRO TIP: Add a QR code to your Evernote Scrapbook page to lead readers to a linked video for a more immersive experience. Move Your Creation to Evernote Once a scrapbook page has been created, Evernote can work its magic. Save the finished page as a .png, .jpg, or even a PDF file, and drop it into Evernote. “Evernote makes your scrapbook searchable,” Linda says. “It allows you to have context for the scrapbook. When you look through it, you can see the date it was created, the names of the kits and fonts you used, and all the relevant links.” Linda’s Evernote scrapbooking includes a lot more than just the scrapbook itself. The world of digital scrapbooking includes a community of like-minded creatives, eager to share their work online. Linda speaks enthusiastically of the community of scrapbookers who meet online, on Facebook , Instagram , and through Twitter hashtags to show off their pages, share tips and tricks, and offer video tutorials for both novices and experienced scrapbookers. “That’s why it’s so important to add artist and photography credits to your pages. Giving credit to the digital artists who created the stamps, stickers, frames and other ephemera not only helps support the artists who created them, but it helps other scrapbookers find elements they liked on your page.” With hundreds of thousands of images and design elements available, building a digital scrapbook is not as simple as looking through a craft drawer for just the right paper or stamp. An organized scrapbooker has to have a system for finding all those elements quickly. Linda chooses Evernote for that task, too. “Buying a kit of scrapbooking elements on Etsy or from a designer’s site is easy, but you have to track them all. If you’ve been collecting for awhile, you start to forget what you have, and it’s easy to buy a kit you already own,” Linda adds. She keeps all her kits on an external hard drive, but she organizes those kits with Evernote. “Let’s say I’m doing a Disney-themed page , and I want some images of Goofy,” she says. As someone who writes the Help pages for Evernote, she is very thorough in her approach to explanations. “Goofy has specific colors. I can search Evernote for Goofy elements, and they’ll come right up. If I just want elements that take on Goofy’s colors, I have to look deeper. But if I’ve tagged other kits with ‘Goofy’ just because the colors remind me of Goofy, those will come up too, and I can make the most of the kits I already have to build my page.” Linda also organizes kits with notebooks—sorted by  designer and kit name—and tags. “I don’t keep the kits themselves in Evernote, that’s not what it’s for,” she points out. “The kits stay on my hard drive, and I just keep links to the content in Evernote. When you buy a kit, you get a single image showing every element that’s in the kit. I’ll put that one image into Evernote along with the link to it, and all the tags I want to give it. So if I’m searching for red and white polka dot ribbon from a particular designer, I’ll put all those tags in. Evernote will return a photo and a link for every kit that meets the criteria I’ve entered. I can quickly check the cover image and then click through to the actual kit on my hard drive. It saves hundreds of hours.” Linda’s just warming up. “Evernote is great for scrapbook pre-planning, too,” she says. “Sometimes you’re in a moment, and you know this is something you’re going to want to scrapbook later. You want to tell that story, but by the time you get home, or a few days pass, you’ve forgotten some of the details. With Evernote, you can just tell yourself the story, and when you’re scrapbooking, you can refer to that event based on the notes you took at the time.” Too often, people abandon hobbies because they can’t find the time to do them. Evernote streamlines the time-stealing search and archiving part of scrapbooking, giving hobbyists like Linda more time for the fun part. Plus, a digital scrapbook page lasts forever. “Your pictures fade, your ink smudges, but not in Evernote,” Linda said. “These will never fade, you have access to it anywhere, and you can share your scrapbooks with friends anywhere without having to lug around your gigantic physical scrapbook.”", "date": "2016-09-9,"},
{"website": "EverNote", "title": "Evernote at SXSW—How to Capture It All", "author": ["Evernote Team"], "link": "https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-sxsw-capture/", "abstract": "Technology, art, music, film, and innovation will collide in Austin, Texas this week, overlapping in unusual ways to bring together creatives and thinkers from all walks of life. Welcome to South by Southwest (better known as SXSW), the annual conference that explores what’s around the corner in a wide range of fields. Running from March 9–18, this year’s conference spans 24 tracks of programming, with speakers ranging from acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky and author Ta-Nehisi Coates to philanthropist Melinda Gates and London mayor Sadiq Khan. Evernote will be there too, and we’re going to be busy. We’re happy to share that this year Evernote will again serve as the official note-takers of SXSW . We’ll be capturing and sharing the best insights from more than 50 sessions in the Workplace, Intelligent Future, and Brands & Marketing tracks, covering speakers from companies including Facebook, Google, Airbnb, The Wing, Cisco, Pandora and more. You’ll even be hearing from members of the Evernote leadership team—our CEO Chris O’Neill and CTO Anirban Kundu will each be offering their views on the future of the tech industry through sessions in the Workplace track. Want a sneak peek from Chris and Anirban? Take a listen to our latest podcast episode for a preview of Evernote at SXSW. So you don’t have to worry about frantically jotting down all the gems of wisdom you hear while you’re there (or grappling with FOMO while you’re sitting on the sidelines at home). Get your hands on all the notes here as they become available. As we get closer to the conference starting, here’s preview of a handful of can’t-miss sessions we’ll be covering: Getting to work The Workplace track sessions span a wide range of topics, such as work-life balance, diversity and inclusion, and the future of work. The common thread? All the sessions focus on what it means to be a human at work in a constantly changing environment. We may be a little biased, but we think these first two workplace sessions can’t be missed: In “ B2B and B2C Are Dead: Now What? ,” Evernote CEO Chris O’Neill will tackle how the ‘bring your own app’ (BYOA) trend is upending the way we both work and build products for the workplace. He’ll outline a new mental model for thinking about workplace solutions: business to individual to teams. Then in “ Sci-Fi to Reality: Evolution of AI in the Workplace ,” Evernote CTO Anirban Kundu will dive into how artificial intelligence technologies are ushering in a new era of workplace productivity. Ever wanted a workflow that intuitively prioritizes the things you care about? Anirban will talk about how it’s possible. In “ The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing ,” bestselling author Daniel Pink will unpack why timing really is everything, showing that it’s not an art, but a science. By getting into the “when” decisions of life, Pink will give time-based tips to help you work smarter and live better. A smarter outlook The Intelligent Future track sessions will explore how technology can be embedded in every aspect of society, from transportation to space exploration to medicine. These speakers will highlight how new possibilities are making just about everything “smarter”. In “ Hacking the Brain: The Power of Neuroenhancement ,” a panel of experts will discuss how advances in electrodes and implants are making the ability to impact neurological functions (such as cognitive skills and motor ability) all the more real. This session will explore the potential of these productivity enhancements, as well as the thorny ethical questions they raise. In “ The Runaway Species: How Creativity Remakes the World ,” a neuroscientist and a composer will explore where humanity’s creativity comes from, diving into what drives it and how we can tap into our creative sides in order to improve our work and life. Communicating new ideas The Brands & Marketing track sessions will focus on the new ways entrepreneurs and companies create and communicate ideas. Whether it’s applying neuroscience, mining data, or telling stories, industry experts will share what’s next in these evolving fields. Millennials are now spending more than 18 hours a day consuming content. In “ The End of Content ,” Giphy’s Alex Chung explores whether we’ve reached ‘peak content’ and discusses where we go from here. The “ Why Your Mom Listens to Podcasts Now ” session features a panel that includes Jason Hock from the HowStuffWorks podcast. Years after the medium first emerged, over 67 million Americans of all ages now tune in to their favorites. What sparked this recent resurgence?
