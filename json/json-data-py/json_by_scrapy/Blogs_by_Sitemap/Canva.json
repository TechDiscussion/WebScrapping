My name is Liz McKenzie, and I’m a hoarder. Clothes, shoes, bags, books and plenty of other miscellany fill my home, waiting for the perfect time in the future when I’ll be able to put them to good use. The problem’s gotten quite bad - my apartment has been hijacked by all my clutter, making it difficult for me to relax at home. The reason I’m laying it all out here is because the first, and often hardest step, is admitting you have a problem. Luckily for me, I haven’t gone too far down the rabbit hole. Slowly (and painfully) I’ve started to weed through the clutter, sorting it out into keep, sell, donate and throw piles. For extra motivation, I’ve set a goal of inviting friends over for dinner next month. I’ve also started to embrace tips from the decluttering expert, Marie Kondo. If you haven’t heard of Kondo, she’s been taking the world by storm with her Netflix series and self-help book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up , introducing smart tidying tips that anyone can put into practice. Kondo offers a simple, yet reasonable explanation of why a lot of us are in this mess (pun intended): we were simply never taught how to tidy. Decluttering also isn’t just about having a tidy home; the true value lies in being able to mindfully choose your possessions and having the ability to shape your environment to reflect the life you choose to live today. Serendipitously, I found myself in a similar place where I needed to reassess my workload. Being with Canva for over a year now, I’ve accumulated a lot of things - and I’m not talking about papers, emails, and various bits and bobs. It was time to evaluate my to-do list and my productivity: am I doing the best with what I have, and if not, what needs to change? I found myself wanting to be more deliberate in setting aside the headspace I needed so that I can embrace the constant change and ambiguity that often comes with many high-growth startups. And to do this, I needed to embrace ‘giving away my legos’. The term “giving away your legos’ is a startup concept that was coined by ex-Googler Molly Graham. Having experienced the chaos that is inevitable with rapid scale and growth, Graham introduced this concept to help others understand the uncertainty and pressure of wanting to do more with less - while thriving at the same time. Let me explain further. During the early stages of a startup, everyone is excited with the fun and opportunity of building new things. Everyone has so many different colored blocks to choose from, each piece potentially playing a crucial role in setting the foundations for this huge, amazing tower. Soon, we find ourselves getting overwhelmed - there is just too much to build and too many legos in front of you that need to be used. Soon, you decide to bring in more builders - and this is that weird moment in time where people start feeling something different… they start feeling nervous about how the other builders are using these legos - are they choosing the right colors? The right shapes? The right placement? When you use this analogy in the business space, it translates to the uncertainty and distrust of others: whether they are able to execute and follow through on your initial vision. Worse, if that builder is doing a great job, many start worrying that the new person will replace them and take over all the fun or important tasks. Graham uses this metaphor to raise awareness of the need to help people get through these emotions - because if you don’t, the results can be horrendous for the business, and have a negative impact on team morale. At Canva, we’ve also embraced this startup philosophy. Giving away our legos have allowed us to grow faster and meet our goals. Giving away responsibility — the part of the lego tower you started building — is the only way we can move on to building bigger and better things for our design community. The Canva team has doubled in size in 2018 alone. What I found during my decluttering exercise at home and my personal growth journey at Canva was that there were many similarities when it comes to striving to live and work harmoniously. As such, there are transferable skills based on these similarities that we can apply at home and in the workplace. “The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past.” ― Marie Kondo You can’t grow if you can’t let go. I once had a spin bike gathering dust at home. I hardly ever used it, but I knew it was there in case I felt the urge to exercise. And that was all it was - an old, bulky chunk of flywheel waiting for the day that never came. When I sold the bike, I signed up to a nearby gym instead. And because I was paying a monthly membership fee, I was more motivated to work up a sweat at a spin class. What this goes to show is the more clutter we collect, the less space we have for ourselves. When thinking about our to-do list, there is an opportunity cost. The more you add to your responsibilities, the less time you have to be able to get things done properly - and the more opportunities you may be missing out on to learn new skills and make an impact. “But when we really delve into the reasons for why we can’t let something go, there are only two: an attachment to the past or a fear for the future.” ― Marie Kondo There are some items at home I’ll never throw away. My wedding album. A trophy. A ring that belonged to my grandmother. Every time I come across these items they made me feel happy. But there are also other sentimental items around that don’t spark any special feeling when I see them. An old Christmas card, an old school uniform, an old laptop… the list was endless. I had kept them because I never thought about repurposing them or I felt it was just the ‘right thing to do’. According to Kondo, the best way to decide whether or not to keep something is to hold each item in your hand and decide whether it sparks joy. Joy is described as an uplifting feeling that you get; it has nothing to do with whether the item is practical or you ‘should keep it’. So applying this concept to our legos at work, it’s important to understand that many of us will naturally feel at odds with giving away some of our responsibilities, despite already having too much on our plate. We’ve worked many hours on the project, and spent many more thinking about the task. It is understandable that a sentimental connection has occurred, and letting go can be difficult. But this is a natural phase of growth and an ongoing journey. And it’s going to take time. But you can’t build another tower if you’re busy clutching too many legos. Our latest cohort of Canva newbies! Growing up, my mother kept a very tidy household - everything had its place and I never had to lift a finger to help. Because I never had the responsibility of tidying, I never learned how. In a business setting, newbies are often onboarded to a company with guidance on how to set up their workspace. They’re given a company dress code policy to help them decide what to wear, and maybe some tips on where to find the best coffee shops in the area. At Canva, we’ve spent a lot of time ensuring our newbie onboarding experience starts before they even set foot in our doors ! So why do we expect everyone to just know how to recognize when it’s time to give away their legos? Based on my experience, and inspired by Kondo’s teachings, here’s a 4-step guide on how to do it. “People cannot change their habits without first changing their way of thinking.” ― Marie Kondo At Canva, we expect our team members to grow as the company grows. What this means is that change is constant, and there are often new challenges to tackle, and new things to learn every day. We try to create a supportive working environment that truly sets everyone up for success. So it’s extremely important that we keep pushing ourselves and set goals that inspire us, because setting a goal that seems really challenging and then being able to actually accomplish it is one of the most satisfying things in the world. Ask yourself if you’re using your time and skills in the best way, and whether there’s something else that could benefit from your expertise and participation. This plays into the concept of ‘paying it forward’ - where someone before you had to let go of their lego so you can grow and shine; now it’s your turn to pay it forward. “We should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.” ― Marie Kondo Be careful of falling into the trap of simply giving away tasks you don’t enjoy. Finding joy in your work is about being able to recognize 3 key factors: Honest answers will help you figure out whether it’s time to give away your lego, and who the best person is to receive them, based on their capacity and capability. They may be able to benefit and learn from the opportunity. “Success is 90 percent dependent on our mind-set.” ― Marie Kondo New challenges come with a lot of experimentation along the way. When giving away your legos, expect to provide some leeway for others to transition into the role. The new owner will be using a lot of time learning and testing different hypotheses to figure out the best way to solve the challenges of the job. To keep everything on track, both parties will need to embrace the art of giving and receiving feedback. Timely and relevant feedback helps everyone stay on track and achieve their goals. Our internal performance coach Sarah Nanclares has written a great post outlining how we’re building a positive feedback culture - it’s both effective and empowering when everyone embraces feedback. It can become frustrating having to deal with failed experiments, but similar to Kondo’s advice on not interfering with or taking control of other people’s belongings, you need to let people make their own mistakes. Instead of interfering, encourage your team to take responsibility for their mistakes and empower them to be accountable and find a solution. “We need to show consideration for others by helping them avoid the burden of owning more than they need or can enjoy.”\n― Marie Kondo A lot of people confuse giving away your lego with one of two things: Once another person has assumed responsibility of a task, it’s incredibly important to allow them to own it fully so you shadow them. Shadow means stepping aside to allow others to lead the project - including owning the vision and goals. Your new role is to provide guidance. On the flip side, over-shadowing means you are still leading, but from the sidelines. This can cause confusion when it comes to ownership and accountability. I find the best way forward is to check in on progress by being a helpful observer. This means guiding without directing, and asking the right questions to ensure they’re on track. Try to refrain from micromanaging, especially if the outcome would likely be the same - this is a surefire way to create a supportive and empowering environment for everyone to flourish. Setting up regular check-ins can be helpful. Here are some questions you might want to use: Check-ins ensure any roadblocks are addressed and keep everyone in alignment. “No matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past. The joy and excitement we feel here and now are more important.” ― Marie Kondo Your work responsibilities really are like your possessions at home. Sometimes you need to keep them, sometimes you don’t. Of course not everyone has the luxury of being able to delegate and pass on their skills to someone else - but even for those of us who do, we often don’t always take the opportunity when we should. And all of us have some make-busy tasks, that feel like real work but really aren’t providing value for anyone. So while I can’t say I’ve mastered the art of tidying, I do know this: decluttering at home and at work is an ongoing process, and the first step is recognizing when it’s time to let go. Hopefully this blog will help inspire you to audit your to-do list, so every second of your time is spent on mindful productivity that sparks joy, is the most impactful task for the company you can be working on and brings out the best in you!

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Out at work and #proudtobe authentically inclusive", "author": ["\nHugo Welke\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/out-at-work-and-proud-to-be-authentically-inclusive/", "abstract": "Canva Product Designer, Hugo Welke, shares the importance of fostering an ‘authentically inclusive’ environment for the LGBTQI+ community to ensure a happier and ultimately more productive workforce and a greater sense of belonging organization-wide. We all have an elemental need to belong - to one another, to our friends and families, our communities, and the workplace. In fact, outside of the home, the workplace is where individuals feel the strongest sense of belonging , it’s where most of us spend the majority of our waking hours. With all that 2020 has thrown at us thus far, the level of disruption and anxiety felt by individuals everywhere is being reported at an all-time high. From a pandemic that has forced each and every one of us to change the way we work, learn and socialize, to the additional barriers for LGBTQ people - especially those coming from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds who face further levels of marginalization, and more recently the ‘dystopian spectacle’ in the US putting racial inequality again on everyone’s radar. Alongside this heightened sense of disruption, some countries have even been reporting an increase in homophobic and transphobic rhetoric, a sense that the world as we know it is on shaky ground. Acknowledging that sense of unease, the question should be asked, what can we do to ensure we create a workplace environment that offers peace of mind for now and long into the future, to ensure all our people feel confident and comfortable enough to be their true selves? This is not simply about having and ticking off a ‘diversity and inclusion’ checklist, it goes far beyond that. We want our people to enjoy coming to work or logging on, and bringing their best selves to the team. That sense of belonging regardless of age, race, sexuality, or gender is embedded in how we create an authentically inclusive environment, how we operate as a work family, and how we live out our values. Genuine. Sincere. Truly what something is said to be; all definitions of authentic, and an apt description of how we strive to be inclusive in the workplace. This is not a set-and-forget exercise, we are constantly evolving to ensure we walk the talk every day and are proactively championing inclusion and building diverse teams. Yes it is the right thing to do and it will pay dividends to our business - as individuals are 3.5 times more likely to contribute to their fullest potential - but we truly believe in being a force for good and we want to take the lead and inspire and empower change in our communities. To create a thriving team and a business, ensuring an inclusive workplace culture is a must. To provide a platform where employees feel welcome in every sense creates a mutual investment, trust, and desire to succeed together. From my perspective, as a proud member of the LGBTQI+ community, I know a good portion of the LGBTQI+ community that has not ‘come out’ at work for fear of discrimination, being unwelcome, and risking potential career opportunities. It takes a lot of mental energy to hide who you are and it can lead to serious health issues . Making changes for inclusion can seem like an enormous undertaking, but all it takes is to start, one step to light the journey for growth and change. At Canva, we’re in an incredible position to make change possible in the world around us. Over the last eight years, we have created a platform that gives people a voice to speak against injustices and inequality. As one of the many people behind the scenes, we all have a responsibility to embody the goodness that we’re empowering our users to bring to the world and to be a good human. To that end, we strive to live and breathe diversity and inclusion in how we work every day. No matter who you are, your skin color, your gender, whatever you’re attracted to, everyone deserves to be treated with respect. With one of our core corporate values ‘being a force for good’ means we are actively working towards a world that isn’t just good for a small few, but one that’s good for everyone. We believe deeply in bringing together the diversity of thoughts, perspectives and expression, as it is critical to our ability to build the best product for our equally diverse community. Internal video highlighting how we’re striving to live and breathe inclusion every day. Body language. Written language. Spoken language. It’s how we communicate, and at its core determines our ability to form lasting bonds with one another, however, it’s equally liable for creating barriers and impacting someone’s sense of belonging . Therefore it is so critical to audit ALL forms of language used within an organization to ensure it’s inclusive and removes any unconscious bias, slang, or expressions that discriminate. “Communication is not what you say, but how it’s heard. Making changes to use more inclusive language offers us a chance to grow and become better communicators while also caring for those we’re communicating with.” - Niel de la Rouviere, Buffer. In relation to the LGBTQI+, it is also important we educate ourselves on the different categories and terms used within that community. While the definitions shared won’t fully describe the diversity of the LGBTQI+ spectrum, the below gives insight into the words and meaning to help make conversations with anyone in the community easier and more comfortable. Different terms used within the LGBTQI+ community. Image resources can be found here . Storytelling is a fundamental human experience that unites people. With subject matters that may be foreign to the audience, it is a wonderful way to explain a situation, a concept, a point of view, and presents a great opportunity to deepen connections with one another. When people feel more comfortable sharing their stories, it makes it easier for their peers to understand and connect. We strongly encourage forums, from our internal newsletters, team meetings and specially organized fireside chats where our people can share their stories in a safe place and help educate everyone on a variety of topics. We celebrate the uniqueness that every person brings to the team, built upon respect, acceptance and kindness. For example, in our recent June internal e-newsletter we featured a Pride section with a collection of articles including a story from one of our LGBTQI+ Manila team member’s who has two dads, and a showcase of the artwork created by our people in celebration of Pride Month. Born This Way by Che Bantayan. “I drew this while listening to a pride playlist ; so if you’re feeling it at the moment, queue up these songs and dance with me! (Born This Way, Believe, Dancing On My Own, I’m Coming Out, I Wanna Dance with Somebody, All Things-Betty Who)” Is it emptiness or just longing? by Sean Philip Olalo / Instagram: @mynegativefeelings. A queer artist originally from Cebu, he uses film photography as a medium to dabble in queer feelings that he hopes to express through his art. “I want my subjects to feel free and comfortable in their own skin. I use butterfly origamis and different types of flowers to explore vulnerability and the fleetingness of being queer.” Pride Flag by Cha Tacang. The iconic rainbow flag has long been a symbol of Pride, ever since it was first unfurled in San Francisco in 1979. Decades later, Gilbert Baker’s most recognizable symbol of LGBTQI+ unity and pride still brings joy and a sense of belonging to members of the community who march under it. Since then, other flags for other sexualities in the queer spectrum have also surfaced as symbols to rally around. “I made this Pride Flag sticker set to celebrate the truth that this community is made up of people of all shapes and colors — and what better way to be loud and proud about it than with stickers. More than being symbolic decor, I have also included the number 4982 to the design to raise awareness about HB No. 4982 or the SOGIE Equality Bill that is currently pending in the House of Representatives. I have also used these stickers to raise funds for the Metro Manila Pride for the past couple of years.” Commissioned artwork, by our very own Landlee Fernandez, to support Pride Month. I am also really proud of a panel led discussion titled ‘Out At Work’ we held recently. Four of our team shared their experience of ‘coming out and being out in the workplace’. It was a useful tool to support those within not just the LGBTQI+ community, but the broader employee base from two perspectives; one, those who may be struggling with their identity, and two, those who can’t relate, but want to know how to support their colleagues, friends and family. One thing I must mention, which was rightfully brought to the fore by an editor at the NPR , is the expectation for an LGBTQI+ person to represent the community as a whole, and answer endless questions about why we do ‘this or that’; that is not what we’re striving for here at Canva. Our hope is by bringing people together, not only do we create a culture of inclusion and openness, we empower others to educate themselves about the LGBTQI+ community, its history - the good, bad and the ugly - to inspire them to want to genuinely learn more, rather than be satiated by a couple a Q&A’s. At the end of the day, we hope by building awareness of the importance of diversity and inclusion, and providing a safe place to speak about it, a library of resources for further education and a platform for knowledge sharing, we encourage healthy conversations that create positive and lasting change. The creation of social clubs is another way Canva strives to heighten our employees’ sense of belonging, at last count we had over 360 different groups within the organization. Being socially connected at work helps buffer against any negative aspects of working, such as the stress of deadlines, and helps work become a little less ‘work’ and more enjoyable. The brains behind each of our social groups work incredibly hard to ensure our clubs provide the perfect platform for our people to connect, share knowledge, keep engaged, build strong long-lasting relationships and become vested in the organization’s culture. With over 900+ employees around the world, with offices in Sydney, Manila, Beijing and Austin, establishing clubs has been an invaluable asset in maintaining our internal culture. Personally, being an active part of Canva’s LGBTQI+ Pride Club and #diversity-inclusion channel is extremely important to me, and something I do with great pride. I’ve been lucky enough that the work, conversation and recognition to develop an inclusive workforce started well before I commenced working at Canva. I strive to continue that great work by being open about my experiences, who I am and sharing my learnings from other organizations I’ve worked within that also prioritize inclusion. It’s also equally as important to recognize not everyone will feel as confident or comfortable as I am and therefore we need to appreciate and support them in any way we can; so I say to those people, it’s through our clubs and overarching willingness to embrace all different walks of life (by walking the walk and talking the talk) that we aim to inspire you to have confidence in who you are and feel a strong sense of belonging and camaraderie here at Canva. I do what I do now so that, one, future generations do not have to justify their existence, and two, everyone feels a sense of belonging regardless of how they might be considered ‘diverse’. Canva’s onboarding process includes sessions on Diversity and Inclusion as well as Unconscious Bias. These training sessions set the tone of Canva’s culture and also provides our starters with some clarity as to what is expected of them as a member of our team. Why is this important? Because we are all different. We are also a global company with an ever-increasing number of personnel; every single soul within Canva is important and as such we are respectful of everyone’s background and point of view. We are also cognizant of the fact that each of us has learned stereotypes ingrained in us that may unintentionally affect our behavior. For instance, when meeting a colleague and you discover they’re married, you may assume they’re in a heterosexual relationship. Alternatively, if asked to speak to a software engineer, you may assume they’re male. These are all examples of unconscious bias, and while they may seem innocent and easily corrected, problems can arise when it happens on a regular basis, especially in the workplace. It can lead to awkward outcomes for both parties within the conversation and it’s our goal here to ensure we mitigate that. I firmly believe that education and information is power. A quick video to help explain what unconscious bias is Our onboarding sessions help our newbies not only get an understanding of our culture, but also empowers them to call out bad behavior if they see it, and to have a vested interest in the continual growth and evolution of our corporate culture as we grow as a company. As a reference point, in 2020, 53% of all Fortune 500 companies have domestic partner benefits and 65% have transgender-inclusive benefits. At Canva, to celebrate the arrival of a newborn (or adoption) the organization provides 16 weeks of fully paid (and 12 months unpaid) parental leave for primary caregivers and 4 weeks (and 12 months unpaid) for non-primary caregivers; this is provided regardless of gender or sexual orientation. We also allow employees to take family and medical leave to care for domestic partners as well as the children of a domestic partner, regardless of biological or adoptive status. In addition, we offer every employee two days of paid compassionate leave for each event that occurs. This is a hard time for any team member and we do whatever we can to offer support and our condolences during this time; family, whatever that unit looks like always comes first. Finally, given the unlimited flexibility in sick and carers leave during the March-June pandemic period, we are working to continue to provide flexibility to everyone until the end of the calendar year. As such, we are in the middle of finalizing a new policy to provide all employees with five additional days of sick and carers leave a year, with the intention to be more flexible with that quota if our people need it. Personally, I love arranging activities to help drive awareness, evolve our culture and further engrain our inclusive nature into the very DNA of the organization. From events through to movie nights and fireside chats, everyone here at Canva loves an opportunity to hang out, regroup, debrief, relax and destress! We’re quite the social bunch. To help raise awareness and embed the LGBTQI+ community even more into the everyday at Canva, we have planned a number of training sessions about Sexuality and Gender, providing a safe environment for sometimes taboo topics to be discussed. Key talk topics include: The first session will be held for our team on July 21 2020 and is open to everyone - members and non-members of the LGBTQI+ community in Canva. We do sessions like these because we strongly believe in empowering others, and being good humans through education. To celebrate the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in February 2020, our Sydney teams developed a whole week of festivities to really hone in on workplace diversity and continue to improve the workplace for everyone.\nSydney’s Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras began in 1978 with a small group of protestors who wanted to contribute to the international Gay Celebrations, however, it resulted in police violence and arrests that not only led to a defining night in Sydney’s LGBTQI+ community but Australia’s cultural heritage. Over the months that followed, more protests and arrests took place, and again the actions of the authorities were often cited being incredibly violent, so much so, by 1979 the Parliament of New South Wales was forced to repeal the NSW Summary Offences Act legislation that allowed authorities to use such force. 1979 was the first year up to 3,000 people marched in an incident-free parade and it marked the beginning of the internationally renowned Mardi Gras Parade people know and love today. This year’s Mardi Gras theme was ‘What Matters’ - which formed the focal point on what matters to us as Canvanauts and how we wish to continue developing our organization to be the best it can be, and the most inclusive it can be. A sneak peek into how we celebrated Pride Week. One of the very talented members of our #lgbtq-pride-club baked this masterpiece. It tasted every bit as good as it looked! Canva’s office is designed as an open plan inclusive environment complete with gender-inclusive bathrooms. For businesses considering a new office fit-out or building, having gender-inclusive bathrooms removes uncomfortable situations that can occur, especially for a colleague who is transgender or transitioning. Above all else, we want each of our current and future employees to know they’re accepted, no matter their gender/identity/race/sexuality/background, and that they’re free to be their true selves in the workplace every single day. One of the great things about working for a forward-thinking company like Canva is being part of the process to design and contribute to the development of products developed to cater to a truly diverse and inclusive world. For the LGBTQI+ community, we had the honor of permanently revamping the Pexels algorithm for all relationship-based search keywords to deliver more diversity across genders and sexualities, giving presence to all types of relationships. It focused on inclusivity and prioritizing LGBTQI+ imagery, democratizing all images, not requiring a user to delineate between same sex or other descriptors. Search terms like ‘couple’ or ‘holding hands,’ that typically only return images of heterosexual couples, now yield photos representing all races, genders and identities, increasing visibility and encouraging mainstream use. We’ve also held several Canva Design School sessions for trans activists from Europe and Asia who are part of the TGEU (Transgender Europe) ; an organization that envisions Europe, Central Asia and the rest of the world free from discrimination, where each person can live according to their gender identity and gender expression without interference and where trans people are respected and valued. They weren’t going to let COVID-19 stop them from advocating for their community’s rights, so they ran a series of online sessions with one of our very own leading a webinar on the Basics of Graphic Design, to further empower trans activists with a way to amplify their voice. For Pride month this year, our teams developed a dedicated landing page showcasing 200+ new elements and 60+ new templates to help people express and spread the Pride spirit. As mentioned earlier, due to the current environment, it felt even more pertinent and humbling to be a part of this process - to help creatively enhance the voices of my fellow LGBTQI+ community members as we couldn’t do so in person. The marketing campaign we developed to promote our new assets was equally as fun. This included an animated Pride clip shared across social media and email marketing which was tailored to each global market and was extremely well received. The below ad in Brazil achieved $0.002 per engagement - which is a phenomenal result. The video encourages users to be self expressive with the new Pride assets available on the Canva platform. An example of the email marketing efforts sent to our database, featuring the Pride assets available on the Canva platform. Also to celebrate Pride Month, a ‘magical moment’ was added to the user interface. When our users typed pride, gay, lesbian, trans and other Pride-related words, the top bar of our platform transitioned into rainbow. This magical moment, an ‘easter egg’ of sorts was created to offer a little extra delight to celebrate Pride month and all that it stands for. This little magical moment was created to reinforce that Canva is aware and proud of our LGBTQI+ users. We know it’s a small gesture and to most, may go unnoticed, but to us, it was to remind our users that we ‘see you’ here and we’re excited and grateful for having you with us. Finally, we know there’s a long road ahead of us in the evolution to creating a perfectly inclusive and diverse workplace, and by no means do we have it all figured out - it is a constant work in progress, but above all else we believe these things are worthwhile to strive for. Everyone has a right to belong, everyone has a right to be their true selves, and it’s our goal to authentically advocate for and foster an inclusive environment for the greater good of all.

With many countries around the globe in lockdown, and domestic and international travel all but come to a complete stop, all of a sudden the traditional workplace is a thing of the past. Excluding our hero frontline workers, the majority are now a remote, or somewhat remote workforce. As working remotely/partially remote becomes the new normal, it’s imperative we consider how this arrangement affects the ‘person behind the employee’. Canva’s Head of People, Crystal Boysen, shares how Canva is looking after working parents and those who are caring for others, while we find our way through the post-COVID era. The world is in the midst of a global crisis, a pandemic no less, where everyone in one way or another has been affected by the new coronavirus. Since COVID-19’s global emergence five months ago, it has been an incredible challenge for businesses of all sizes and governments across every nation to #stopthespread. The workplace of pre-2020 is no longer, as organizations around the globe try to function either in a fully or partially remote working environment, trying to navigate this new normal. This is uncharted territory, and whilst scientists and epidemiologists around the world are scrambling to learn more about the disease in the hope of finding a vaccine, the rest of us are trying to put ‘best practice’ in place to assist in flattening the curve and keep our communities as safe as possible. There are many countries around the world gradually easing isolation restrictions, however some have experienced a second wave of infection, and it constantly remains top of mind for my colleagues and I - what role do we play in ensuring the same doesn’t happen within our places of work and our broader communities? Either way, one thing is certain, the impact of COVID-19 will be felt for months, perhaps years, and as a business, we need to be prepared for the long term. Depending on where you live, schools and daycares may still be closed. Others may be making a judgement call and keeping their children at home to prevent exposure or transmission of the virus to others. What this means is a work/life balance, in the traditional sense, is going to be even harder to attain for many working parents. Looking at the figures closer to our Sydney office, there are currently 7.2 million families in the Australian workforce , and with schools only just now re-opening its doors for students full time, and daycares still functioning at less capacity due to funding restrictions, parents have been required to be full-time parents during the day, but also maintain their full time jobs. The reality is, parents around the globe have been forced to juggle two very important priorities and undoubtedly feel stretched thin, under tension and burned out. I’ve read of parents who have said the enforced WFH policy and being a parent broke them professionally and personally. I can understand why. I’ve also heard from parents who are struggling with a work-home life-distinction; with no physical disconnect between work and home, and the multiple hats parents wear every day - mum/dad, partner, chef, chauffeur, teacher, cleaner, ‘organizer of the household’ - working longer hours and still managing to do absolutely everything; there are only so many hours in a day - something has to give. So how do we alleviate some of the pressure? We certainly don’t have all the answers, but, as a starting point, we’re firm believers in leading with compassion. Every single person we come across could be fighting a battle we know nothing about and sometimes as leaders we become so focused on deadlines, numbers, quotas, goals and a never-ending to-do list, that we can lose sight of the fact our team members are human beings, just like us. We cannot forget compassion is an instinct we’re all born with, it’s ingrained in us at our very core, and for us here at Canva, we make sure we’re cognizant of that, and really try to ensure it’s at the forefront of all we do. We’re not leading with compassion solely for parents who are being full time carers and professionals simultaneously, or those family units who have had people laid off from their jobs. We strive to lead with compassion for all, in any circumstance - however it’s now more important than ever, during this unprecedented time, to rally together to support those that need extra support and little more empathy and understanding. But what does that actually mean - to lead with compassion? “While empathy is the tendency to feel others’ emotions and take them on as if you were feeling them, compassion is the intent to contribute to the happiness and wellbeing of others.” — Harvard Business Review At Canva it’s not about being in charge, but rather taking care of those in our charge. To us, leading with compassion means through every thought, word and deed, we empathize with our employees’ needs while focusing on the actions we can take to contribute to their overall happiness and wellbeing. At Canva, we believe compassion is foundational to a healthy working environment . We are committed to doing our best to always put our people first, provide them the flexibility they need to not only meet all their professional goals, but also the day-to-day needs of their personal lives, support their growth and, in this instance, foster an environment that helps them do their best work during this challenging time. During this global crisis, Canva’s people-first response means we are providing ongoing, day-to-day flexibility for working parents, so they can strike a balance between both work and family commitments without it impacting their salary. We completely trust our people to put in their best effort. Family first, with a “whatever works for you, works for us” mentality. How? What are the initiatives? We firmly believe in empowering not only our working parents, but all of our employees, to find a daily schedule that works for them and simply ask them to communicate their availability to their respective teams. We also encourage them to lean on their coach to assist in prioritizing workloads, clarify expectations and regularly check in on progress. At the end of the day, our main priority is to ensure everyone’s safety and wellbeing. A parent myself, I know how easily things come up at home that draw me away from my workday, that’s why it’s so important in this current situation to be fluid – with kids at home it’ll be a rare event if you can lock yourself away for a 9-5 routine. Truthfully working from home has been a tough adjustment. I have two little ones who have been home full time since mid-March. Luckily my husband has been willing and able to be the primary carer while I work, but I still struggle with finding the right balance and managing the associated guilt that comes along with trying to do it all. Crystal, her husband and 2 children - Emery, 3, and Bennett, 1. My kids don’t fully understand the concept of mommy working from home yet so I get plenty of ‘visitors’ throughout the day and it’s hard not to be distracted, or want to join them when you hear them playing outside your door all day long. Crystal’s son, Bennett, ‘zoombombing’ work calls has become a welcomed addition to those also on the call, so much so Crystal’s colleagues have come to expect his appearance during meetings. During this time, I’ve learnt that I need to let go of the guilt and figure out what works best for me and my family. I’ve realized I have to balance my workday with my family time in a new way and am looking for the positives. For example, without a commute to the office, I’m now able to spend more time with the kids in the morning and afternoon. I block my calendar from 7-9am so we can have quality time as a family and we’ve tried to repurpose ‘commute’ time into family walks. I also try to always log off my computer by 5pm and am fiercely protective of a no meeting rule in the evenings when bath and bedtime routines reign supreme. I often check emails or jump back online after the kids have gone to bed, but that flexibility is important for me to feel like I’m able to fit ‘work’ with ‘life’. There’s a lot of commentary out in the public domain about managing the ‘mental load’. We know parents are struggling to balance work, child care and self-care while keeping worries under control – both your children’s and your own. You don’t have to do it alone. This is why the provision of support is so important to Canva. To support our team members, we’ve created a dedicated internal website that provides guidance on how to seek support - including mental health support for those who feel anxious, confused, scared or stressed during this outbreak, as well imparting coping mechanisms for working in physical isolation from others. Canva is also fully covering the cost of Employee Assistance Program (EAP) sessions, delivered online, to further ensure the team’s well being in the workplace and also in their personal lives. We also fully subsidize Mindfulness/Meditation app subscriptions such as Headspace, Calm or Smiling Mind, as meditation has been shown to help people stress less, focus more and even sleep better . We’ve also hosted a number of webinars, from ‘Managing stress and building resilience in times of uncertainty’ to ensure our teams have the tools required to help cope during these challenging times, to most recently hosting a virtual Q&A session with Audrey McGibbon from Global Leadership Wellbeing Survey and Martine Beaumont from Select Wellness, to lead a discussion about the importance of balance and boundaries in managing the challenges of working from home. The longer our environment is compromised or limited by the impact of COVID-19 the more we’ll continue to add to this space; I have no doubt circumstances will continue to change. To provide greater flexibility to take care of ourselves and our loved ones during the COVID-19 global crisis, Canva is not requiring employees to log sick or carer’s leave. All that is asked is that those employees provide transparency on time away to coaches, group leads and other members of the team so that business as usual can continue, and where necessary a team approach needed to chip in and get things done. We’ve also put together a few support resources specifically on how to WFH while caring for others. The above is a quick 5-step guide our fellow parents pulled together to ‘information-share’ how they got through a work day with kids in the house. At the end of the day, for those with extra obligations at home, we’re not asking them to work harder or to make up for the time others within your team are more likely to have. It’s time for all of us to take a moment and try to understand the person behind the ‘employee’, the commitments, the responsibilities, the mental load. So on a final note: Whether it’s within your workplace, or personal life, it’s times like these that call for all of us to lead with compassion - our greatest strength stems from rallying together. There are enough stressors in the world without the COVID-19 pandemic thrown into the mix. Take solace in that it won’t always be this way. Hang in there, be kind yourselves, your families and your employees in this difficult time. Remember, help is always available to you if you need it.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "The importance of culture as you scale", "author": ["\nCameron Adams\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/the-importance-of-culture-as-you-scale/", "abstract": "Canva co-founder and CPO, Cameron Adams, shares his thoughts on the importance of culture and how it is the driving force behind Canva’s ability to be a force for good in the world, especially one that is in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic. Every assumption we’ve ever made about running Canva has been challenged in the last three months. Running meetings. Setting goals . Product roadmaps. Onboarding newbies . Supporting parents . Even going for coffee. The world has been upended since COVID-19 first emerged five months ago and it has been an incredible challenge for businesses of all sizes: from corner stores to corporations. Since we took the step of going entirely remote to #stopthespread we have been on a steep learning curve of how to collaborate with 900+ people all around the world who had no idea at the start of 2020 that they’d be working from dinner tables, ironing boards and corner desks for more than three months. (Six months? A year? Who knows?) The one thing I take solace in – and have taken solace in every time we are met with a challenge at Canva – is the people we have with us on this journey. Canva’s ethos is very strong on its sense of belonging and inclusion – here’s a little video we pulled together to showcase all that we stand for, at one of the company’s quarterly events, the Season Opener. When I look at how Canvanauts act, how they selflessly prioritize their colleagues and our community, how they swarm around problems, how they think creatively; I am extremely proud. Within 24 hours of announcing that everyone would be working remotely, teams all across Canva had made it a reality. And not just a functional reality, an enjoyable and productive one. Clarity was given on all the tiny minutiae of working from home – mobile internet allowances, lunch stipends, flexibility for parents juggling at-home kids. Teams adjusted their cadences for video meetings and online collaboration. Our in-house gym went virtual with daily video training sessions. Partnerships were made with mindfulness apps to support our mental health. Our kitchen converted all the produce slated for company lunches into meals that could be shipped to those in need via charities. And all this was done organically, driven primarily by individuals working at the grassroots and coming up with the ideas and solutions that could make it all viable. Every person that joins us on the Canva journey has a unique and powerful impact on where we – as an organization – go from here. Needless to say, our strength is in the type of person our culture attracts, who rallies around Canva’s mission, and who is empowered to pursue that mission through a multitude of avenues. That well-articulated culture has burned brightly for a while now and is, for me, the ultimate sign of our success. But it wasn’t always that way. Back when we were a small team, eight people all sitting around the same table, I remember reading advice to entrepreneurs about “maintaining culture” and scoffing. We were a tight-knit team, building an amazing product. Culture was the last thing we needed to focus on building. But whether we knew it or not, we were building it anyway. “When they started out, our co-founders believed that they were creating a great product. Then they realized that they were creating a great company that creates great products. Finally, they realized that it was most important of all to create a culture that enables the creation of a great company that creates great products.”\n— David Noël, Soundcloud Creating a culturally focused company from its very inception would be an interesting experiment, however, the genesis of most startups is in solving a problem or building something that you desperately think should exist. Your focus is on that and that alone. But through the process of making a product or harnessing technology you are intrinsically imbuing your organisation with a culture: the natures of the people that you hire and work with, the decisions you make, the shorthand you use to collaborate, the choices you make in your product and your roadmap… they are all imprinted with your cultural fingerprint. And it’s that fingerprint that expands out like the rings of a tree to form your organization as it grows. At Canva we never shirk from a challenge, and we take great pride in tackling things in a way that others would be intimidated by. It’s the foundation for one of our six values: Set crazy big goals and make them happen. This value is talked about a lot to make sure people understand the process by which we set these big goals and the expectations we have that people will try to use this process in every aspect of their work. But it’s also lived a lot by setting crazy big goals ourselves as leaders and then pursuing them with all our heart. The perfect example of this is the way that we went about internationalizing our product. Canva’s six core corporate values. ‘Be a force for good’ and ‘Empower others’ - making the world a better place through positive actions, inclusion and diversity. ‘Pursue excellence’ - maintain a high bar for ourselves and the people we work with. Continuous growth and development. Lead by example. ‘Be a good human’ - valuing good communication. Being open, honest and constructive: individually, within your team, across the company, and externally. ‘Make complex things simple’ - always aiming for the most simple, pragmatic and effective solution to any problem. Think of the user. ‘Set crazy big goals and make them happen’ - set ambitious goals, prioritise, hustle to execute and celebrate success! In 2015 we had achieved great growth as a design tool, but that growth had been restricted to people who could speak English. Our product was in English, our emails were in English, our templates were in English, even our marketing was all in English. We realized to grow a truly global product and to fulfil our mission – empower the world to design – we needed to move beyond this mono-lingual view of the world and make a product that was truly accessible by everyone in the world. We did a tiny bit of benchmarking with tech companies that had come before us, like Facebook and Google, and saw that they’d taken almost 10 years to become fully internationalized products. We decided we could do it in two. So we set ourselves the goal of being in 100 languages by the end of 2017. The cross-team collaboration required to achieve this was mind boggling. Not only did we have to deal with the technical aspects of serving different languages in different parts of the world, we also had to setup a translation pipeline that would automatically do this any time someone wrote a piece of text, get our email engine to do the same for any of our communications, and then start serving Russian design content to Russians and Portuguese design content to Brazilians. We didn’t know how we were going to do it all when we started, but after taking the first few steps we learnt from our stumbles, iterated and adapted along the way. On December 24, 2017 we published Canva in our 100th language. Canva has over 100 languages – including five right to left scripts such as Hebrew and Arabic. An example of the many languages used on the Canva platform. It was a time for massive celebration. Internally, we designed our own beautiful mural on one of our office walls – with the word ‘creativity’ in all one hundred languages. Members of our team each doing their part in creating our very own mural celebrating Canva in over 100 languages! Putting resources into such a crazy big goal is not only about calculating the return on investment, it’s also a huge signal culturally about what we value and what we’re striving to achieve. As you grow there’s a real balance you need to achieve by showing examples and giving people a deeper understanding of the ‘why’. Actions may speak louder than words, but it’s important to back culture up with examples and communication, so that people understand expectations, can express them to others that come into your tribe, and also demonstrate them so newcomers see them in effect. We didn’t codify our culture into our six values until about four years into our journey, but since then we’ve seen how massively valuable it is to have that shared understanding of what everyone at Canva believes in and how that shapes our decisions moving forward. Our values are at the heart of everything we do. They’re the spirit behind every action and intention here at Canva, helping us to create a workplace where everyone can thrive. No matter what someone’s role is, where they’re based or what their goals are, our values act as a universal guide to help our teams do the best work of their life at Canva. So much so, we created our very own Culture Book , which highlights how we strive to live by our values, and paves a way for new employees to feel at home within our organization straight away, so they’re ready to take on the world with us. The team developed a Canva Culture Book, primarily for new starters so they know what our values are, and how each member of our team strives to live them daily. A lot of the Canva culture you’ll see talked about in the press revolves around the shiny things – free lunches, a gym, extra-curricular clubs – but it’s not until something like COVID-19 hits you begin to see the real culture of an organisation. It’s in those moments of crisis and stress, when everyone is reacting reflexively and having to make their own decisions, that you witness a person’s – or team’s – true colors. By the end of our first day of remote work, everyone’s ‘Be a good human’ side had come out: Slack channels had sprung up to share WFH information, people were offering cars to move desks and chairs, our coaches had swung into full support mode for anyone experiencing mental stress, and our People team had reached out to ensure the safety of anyone travelling overseas. We’re all team players. We keep our minds open, our intentions kind and our actions respectful. For us, this is what being a good human is all about. By the end of the second day, everyone was exemplifying how we strive to ‘Be a force for good’ . We were reaching out to our community, figuring out who was hardest hit and who needed the greatest support. We were scrambling to find the best content for teachers who needed to teach remotely for the first time. We were helping out businesses who couldn’t afford to keep their doors open. Our kitchen staff kept busy and started pulling together meals for those in need. Every single person who works within our organization – and the culture they collectively create – becomes part of our story in making a positive impact in the world. So whilst we don’t have our shared lunches or our rooftop yoga sessions anymore (and who knows when we’ll get them back), after seeing our team swiftly move into WFH mode since the start of March, it’s easy to see how the culture we nurture and are so proud of, trumps any of those perks.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "How we’re spreading good vibes while everyone’s working from home", "author": ["\nChristopher Low\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/spreading-the-good-vibes-while-working-from-home/", "abstract": "The impact of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, is being felt around the world. In response to these unprecedented and uncertain times, Canva has requested all employees work from home as a preventative measure. Maintaining the health and safety of our team and community is our priority - and so is making sure they can do their best work while feeling safe and engaged. In this blog, head of Canva’s Vibe team, Chris Low, shares how Canva is using technology and creativity to help spread the good vibes to all its remote employees worldwide. Canva’s humble journey started in our CEO and cofounder’s mother’s lounge room in Western Australia. Eight years later, a now global business with offices in Sydney, Manila and China, our 800+ strong team is testament to our ability to maintain a happy, engaged and productive workforce. In December 2019/January 2020 Australia overcame one of its worst national disasters with fire storms ravaging our lands, during which we witnessed the great Aussie spirit, pure grit and bravery, hope and overwhelming stories of kindness, generosity and charity. Meanwhile the eruption of Taal Volcano in Batangas, Philippines also in January meant our team members in Manila had to adapt to new work schedules, while our colleagues in China were starting to feel the first waves of the coronavirus outbreak hit home. Now the pandemic is spreading. We’re witnessing unprecedented times, with many people in panic mode - ranging from pensioners, business owners, parents and their school children, in limbo wondering what the next few months will look like. We’ve seen people battling each other for the last roll of TP, stockpiling goods, abusing retail staff for nation-wide enforced rations, mass organisation-wide layoffs - it could be said this pandemic is bringing out the worst in everyone. Being located in Sydney myself, I’ve personally witnessed polar opposite ‘vibes’, only months apart. With governments around the globe urgently trying to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, Australia has imposed a number of strict regulations to slow down infection rates: Our priorities are to, above all else: But what happens to team morale, and the culture Canva is so lovingly known for, when all face-to-face contact, in-person meetings, international and domestic travel, and other events are put on hold to work from home? In this blog post, I’ll share how the Canva Vibe team is taking our mission further by lifting morale and engagement across our remote workforce. Now more than ever, the need for good vibes and a strong company culture is intensifying. So much so, our ‘Vibe Team’ has been working tirelessly over the past couple of weeks to ensure that when the time came for the entire 800+ Canva workforce to work remotely, the same culture could be felt across the world wide web, straight to everyone’s home office/couch/dining room table - wherever their best work is done! Our Vibe Team is a dedicated group of individuals (roughly 1 to every 25 employees) whose primary purpose is ensure there is a strong internal culture, and therefore a wonderful work environment that inspires everyone to do their best work - to have that fire in their belly to continuously learn and improve, as well as feel supported and truly love what they do each day. To that end, with our now completely remote workplace, the Vibe Team has developed a dedicated internal website as a one-stop-shop key resource to help bolster our team’s strong sense of belonging and camaraderie. Keeping the vibe alive - Canva’s dedicated internal online resource helping employees work remotely successfully, maintaining productivity, connectivity and health. (Click to enlarge) An ever-evolving platform, currently the site includes: A dedicated space where super top line updates (also known as TL:DR content) are shared for the global team; they will be updated on a ‘as they happen’ basis. Additional Slack channels have been created with working from home (WFH) tips and tricks, how-tos and a bit of fun; these include #wfh-fashion-challenges, #wfh-food-and-bev-challenge where teams can spice up and share their working from home outfits, join the daily cook-along and ‘rate your mates’ plates and #best-of-zoom-meetings where our team can show off their best Zoom backgrounds and calls. Content that is normally played across our digital screens within Canva’s Sydney offices, are now being broadcast virtually through our new ‘intranet’. Updated daily, the purpose of this dashboard is to inspire lunch options, recommend good books, recognise ‘Canvaversaries’ and birthdays, and welcome our newest recruits (known as ‘Canvanauts’). It’s important we continue to implement as many BAU activities as possible - for it is these quirky little internal communication pieces that add up to make Canva’s well-loved culture and vibe. Since the Canva team cannot enjoy the delicious meals in-house, the Vibe team put together lunch ideas daily for people to make at home, using the simplest of processes and ingredients. Tips and tricks from people within Canva who can impart useful information on how to bring out the best in everyone whilst working remotely. Just because we’re not in the office, doesn’t mean we cannot celebrate our people’s birthdays! It’s important to the ongoing vibe and culture of Canva for everyone to maintain a sense of connectivity, celebration and acknowledgement. Continuing to celebrate milestones, like work anniversaries, within the organisation is also key to keeping our people engaged, rewarded and acknowledged during the times we are working apart. A central area containing all the key information relating to COVID-19 and WFH policies. Includes country-specific government updates and mandates, new company-wide announcements, as well as toolkits for BAU activity to proceed remotely, ensuring we’re working as a collective as seamlessly and cohesively as possible. In this current climate, we are extremely lucky to be able to keep up our livelihood and work from home, especially as there are other industries that don’t have this opportunity. One area that has been impacted massively are our local cafes, restaurants and commercial fruit and vegetable suppliers; and closer to home, our very own suppliers to Canva. We see this as a great opportunity to embrace our values and offer support to these communities in need. All our team members receive a daily lunch stipend whilst we’re a 100% remote workforce - and during this time we’re encouraging everyone to think about the communities that have been greatly affected by the current situation when it comes how and where to spend the allowance. To that end, our people can: Receive the stipend in their fortnightly paycheck to spend within their local communities, supporting their local providers. OR Help local suppliers and provide food to local charities 🙏 Rather than receiving the stipend in one’s paycheck, it’ll be donated to either Wayside Chapel or OzHarvest. We have chosen these charities as they reflect the values that we ourselves embody and echo our philosophy of being able to bring people together through good nutritious food. OR Help local suppliers and receive a home delivery hamper 🥖 Most of Canva’s food and beverage suppliers have lost up to 80%-90% of their weekly clients and are facing uncertain futures. To ensure they are able to keep operating we have pulled together a weekly mixed hamper that showcases their amazing seasonal produce and smallgoods. The hamper will be delivered every Tuesday and contain the following: Our resident chefs have developed weekly menus, shopping lists and how-to videos to inspire. The video series showcases how easy, and cost-effective, it is to pull together a healthy breakfast and lunch using limited resources. Updated weekly, the videos include step-by-step instructions on how to make pesto linguine through to the ultimate in 2 minute noodles recipes. An example of some of the delicious how-to videos Canva’s Kitchen team pull together on a weekly basis to inspire what we eat at home. Our resident Health and Wellbeing Coach has transformed a whole raft of wellness plans into virtual ones via Zoom - including fitness programs like chair yoga, how to deal with 3:30itis and a series of stretches and functional movements to get the blood flow moving. Here’s an example of one of the many exercises shared with our teams, to keep our bodies moving and help us all be less sedentary: An example of one of the many simple how-to videos our resident Health and Wellness Coach provides on the daily. From #wine-club and #music-club, through to #pasta-club-official and #mindfulness-club, the virtual club scene is strong at Canva. Keeping our employees engaged and active in the company - beyond their remit as per their job description - is an integral part of our culture. We have over 360 active clubs currently at Canva, with many more by the day moving to a virtual format; their value is enormous to building strong long-lasting relationships with other members of our team, the cross-pollination of ideas and information and knowledge sharing. A snapshot of all the different virtual clubs our teams can participate in while we’re all working remotely. An example of how our well-loved #wine-club participants keep engaged. Moving 800+ people completely online is unchartered territory for many, so the development of our WFH (working from home) tips resource offers insight into some of the best ways to work with remote teams, as well as how to stay productive while watching Netflix plus much more. We’ve also developed a comprehensive ‘Remote Working Toolkit’ which includes resources for individuals, teams and leads; such as guidelines for remote work, WFH productivity reimbursements, list of tools available for remote collaboration such as Slack, Zoom, Trello, Jira, Coda and the like. Canva University has also launched a ‘How do you remotely do it?’ series, including a number of panels, sessions and deep dives on working remotely. Currently featuring four shows - hosted by some of Canva’s most charismatic team members - these dedicated podcasts are critical to boosting engagement across our entirely remote organisation. Over 42 million people listen to podcasts weekly, that’s more than people go to the movies! A statistic that will sure rise given the current #coronavirus climate. This form of communication: It’s extra important to look after your headspace when working remotely for extended periods and during times of uncertainty. To effectively support the mental health of all our people, Canva is providing every employee with: Whether you’re looking for soap or kids panadol, this dedicated area includes an interactive map where team members can upload ‘shopping hotspots’. It also allows you to ‘pin drop’ companies that have had to close their doors, but are still alive and kicking online - so we can continue to ‘shop local’. Finally there’s an area to ‘Hitch a Ride’ - where if you have a car, you can list your availability to help out other Canvanauts if needed. We’ve developed a virtual ‘Friday Night Drinks’ Zoom meeting which features live performances to support the local entertainment industry that has been so disadvantaged by the outbreak of COVID-19. An initiative to help keep the internal wins and celebrations alive, and continue building connections with each of our teams - while we’re all remote. From virtual games of Pictionary and Bingo as an ice breaker, through to dedicated dress up meetings (Canva is big on dress ups - especially at our Season Openers - we’ve had Under the Sea, Game of Thrones, Hawaiian just to name a few), exercises with our resident Health and Wellness Coach and specialised cooking tutorials with our group of chefs. An interactive list of ways to keep the celebrations alive while the team are remote. I am a firm believer that ‘keeping the vibe alive’ (or culture) is absolutely paramount for any organisation, especially during times of crisis and uncertainty. For us, we know our culture and vibe is the backbone to our success; our great people develop our great products. It takes a village to constantly lead the charge and work to become one of the world’s most loved brands. We hope these initiatives will help us ride this wave of uncertainty, by providing an environment for our people to be the best they can be, deliver their best work and ensure we continue to deliver a service that is exceptional. We’re not professing to have all the answers, we’re learning as we go - this is unchartered territory, and we are well aware there are organisations that do not have the luxury or flexibility to implement the measures we have - but every little effort can add up to something more impactful. If our methods mean less people commuting to and from work, with less touchpoints running the risk of infection, it’s just one small step to help keep our communities safer. Secondly, if our initiatives inspire other organisations to implement little changes to make their respective teams and communities safer, more cohesive, then that too is a win. Thirdly, our people come first, second and third - during this time of crisis each and everyone’s well being is of the utmost importance - it takes a village to build and maintain a business like ours - and if we can do our bit to ensure our global teams have what they need to be good humans and to excel in their work and home life, then we’re ensuring we’re doing our bit to be a force for good. We, as an organisation, are offering all public health organisations (PHO) around the world with free lifetime licences for Canva Pro. This initiative comes in response to the surge of misinformation surrounding the virus, as PHO’s struggle to fight back against myths and rumours gaining traction in the public domain. Canva’s in-house design team is volunteering its services to PHO’s in need of further assistance with delivering effective visual communications. We have also launched a collection of new health-related templates including flyers, posters and social media posts designed with pre-populated content based on the information supplied by the World Health Organisation (WHO). All of our farm produce is being donated to Wayside Chapel, local communities and OzHarvest. We’re also producing finished meals for our nearby charity organisations, to continue to help those in need during this global crisis. Regardless of where you are in the world, 2020 will be one of the toughest years yet. We all need to rally together to build resilience and courage, help each other out, share information/resources and learn from each other so that together we can come out the other side of this global crisis stronger and more empowered than ever before.

The global digital marketing spend is fast set to reach $100 billion , the need to respond quickly to market dynamics is not only imperative to reach your target audience - but having a sound digital marketing strategy is also good for the bottom line. However the reality is that having a huge budget to experiment with can only bring you so far. The key to maximizing your digital marketing spend is a sound ability to understand your audience - the whos, whats, wheres, whens and hows - culminating into an actionable strategy to influence behaviours and motivations (Audience x Channel x Time x Product x Message). I’ll delve more into this later. Let’s take our work at Canva as an example. We have a focused set of goals when it comes to digital marketing: With a lot of audience research and experimentation, we were able to: In this blog, I’ll share how we achieved these figures by following 8 simple yet powerful steps. Ask yourself the following questions of your audience - Who are they? What are their goals? What problems are they trying to solve? What are their frustrations? Know who you’ll be talking to, because this will be the basis of how you’ll engage with them. Know your top 3 audiences and create personas for them. A sample persona Now that you know WHO you’ll be engaging with, the next question to ask about your audience is - WHERE is their attention? And then understand the channel in which they are spending most of their time in. For example, if they spend most of their time on Facebook, what are they doing there? Are they there just to connect with friends, or are they very involved in particular groups and communities? Do they get a large amount of their news and/or entertainment content from Facebook? If it’s Instagram, what are they doing there? Linking back to step #1 - If they are a teenager, are they there to impress their friends? To connect with their friends? To chat?\nIf your audience are entrepreneurs, are they there to build a following? To share tips/insights? To provide edu-tainment? Now that you have a solid understanding of your audience/s and where they spend their time, we need to link this back to the product or service you are looking to promote. Therefore you need to understand your unique selling proposition, and learn more about your value in the eyes of your users by seeking out qualitative and quantitative data. This step cannot be underestimated, as your audiences’ behaviour can tell you a lot about why they use your product or service. Why do people spend 10x more over a Gucci logo shirt, over a non-branded one which serves the same purpose? This is where we start looking into motivations behind human decisions, and threading steps 1, 2 and 3 together by developing the message that will connect and resonate with your audience. It is also important that you now consider the channel you’re communicating in, and the product/service you’re trying to sell. To do this, we need to understand that as humans we buy for one of 3 reasons: Knowing this, you can begin to identify the ingredients to craft the right message of WHY your audience should care. This 5th step is easily overlooked, but ignoring the “when” can lead to a CPA (cost per acquisition) up to 20 times more expensive than your competitors. Let’s expand on this with the example of teenagers; they are most likely school students, so knowing this we ask ourselves, when are they on their phone and/or laptop? Before school? During lunch? End of school? On public transport to and from home? Are they on-the-go? Are they actively seeking your product out, or do they need to be convinced? Do they have high or low intent? Ensure your marketing efforts are present at the height of WHEN they are active and/or seeking a solution to their problem. Now that we have a comprehensive understanding of the above, this is what it looks like when we put it all together! A conversion happens when you deliver an ad to: These are your major levers. As you build upon each, it has a compounding impact on the effectiveness of your campaigns. After lots and lots of experimentation with these levers, you will begin to see how the varied permutations of Audience x Channel x Time x Product x Message come to interact with one another, and how that impacts your desired performance results. Over time you will begin to identify the recipe for success, but there is no silver bullet as the levers will constantly evolve. Set goals before every campaign and experiment with an understanding of what your expectations are, then measure and track your results. Something I see many marketers forget to do is reflect on the results. It’s as simple as asking the following questions: As you exercise reflection more and more, you will develop your marketing skills to the point where you can say with high accuracy what will, and will not work. As new ad channels become available, or you have a new product to sell, this new found “intuition” will give you a significant head start when the time comes to launching that first campaign. Even though the focus of this post has been on paid channels, these principles are also applicable to owned channels such as content marketing, email and messaging. Therefore it’s critical to note that users do not experience your brand in isolation of other channels. Depending on the size of your growth or marketing team, the need to ensure a cohesive user experience becomes more important the larger your organisation is. If you feel like you’re starting to create a disjointed user experience, get alignment with other teams, because you should all be working together for a common mission. I’d love to hear what stood out for you from what I’ve shared, and if this article has changed your approach to digital marketing.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Building a Data-Driven Autocorrection System", "author": ["\nAshwanth Fernando\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/building-a-data-driven-autocorrection-system/", "abstract": "In the Search team at Canva, we’re passionate about providing a fantastic search experience for our users. A challenge we’re constantly tackling is how to provide the content that our users are looking for, faster. We try to achieve this in many ways, be it our data-driven search relevance algorithms, our “related searches” pills or our trending searches. These awesome products help users quickly create fabulous designs that they can use to achieve their goals. Today we’re introducing another feature called Autocorrect that helps users achieve their goals of creating great design. Autocorrection is not new, and is available on other search engines such as Google where if the user makes a typo, Google will correct it or suggest a correction: Our goal was to build something similar to this where we correct queries behind the scenes if our confidence is high, or else provide a suggestion to the user if not. We also wanted our autocorrection system to be smart and not provide basic rudimentary corrections from a dictionary. For example: When Memorial Day was trending, if users wanted to search for content that resembles memorial day, then autocorrect should be able to correct ‘memorail day’ to ‘memorial day’ and perform a search so that our search engine can match documents that are tagged with those keywords. We also wanted the autocorrection system to learn continually from its mistakes. If users did not like our corrections, then we would demote those corrections to suggestions and would further go ahead to remove them from the suggestion list if they continued to perform poorly. This post explains how we built a data-driven system that can achieve this feat at scale across languages. We started off with how to distinguish between a misspelled word and a correctly spelled word. A metric called the Edit/Levenshtein Distance FN_EDIT(wordA, wordB) returns a number that specifies the minimum number of changes required to transform one string to the other. An implementation of the algorithm to compute the Edit Distance from Wikipedia is shown here: For example, the edit distance between ‘achievement’ and ‘achivement’ is 1. Assuming we had a dictionary of words, a rudimentary autocorrect system would work if we took the query, split it by tokens and compared each token with all the words in the dictionary, sort them based on increasing order of edit distance and took the first word in that list. This is fairly time consuming (each comparison has a time complexity of O(len(wordA)*len(wordB))) according to the implementation of the algorithm, which would fairly take a while to complete the entire dictionary. We could go one step further and cache the computation which will make subsequent calls for that query faster. One step further again would involve pre-processing all the possible combinations for all words and storing them in a configuration file or database, and having the request do a lookup by each token of the query. In terms of space complexity, for each word the number of combinations of that word with edit distance 1 is (len * 25). So just for a word like ‘achievement’, the number of possible typos will be 275 (11 * 25). This is assuming just replacement typos (where a letter has been replaced by another) and not additions or deletions. If we take additions, deletions, case and bigger edit distances into account we will end up with thousands of possible combinations just for one word. In other words, storing each combination is not feasible due to the number of combinations per word. Given the fact that keyboards are structured in a certain way we had some intuition that we could exploit the proximity of keys and prune a lot of combinations to just the typos that have a high probability of occuring. If we could look at past user queries to extract possible query/replacement pairs, that would be a good first step in identifying those typos that occurred frequently. The first step was to identify and extract query chains across users, so for example if we had a user that made a series of queries (archery, archer, aarow, arrow) in a session with Canva, we would store those queries. With these queries we were able to strip out chronologically ascending pairs such as (archery, archer), (archery, aarow), (archery, arrow) followed by (archer, aarow) and so on. To learn more about query chains, take a look at this academic paper . To achieve a high signal that the latter query in each pair is a valid correction, we also added a conversion metric to each of these queries (i.e. whether the query converted to clicks or revenue). With the conversion metric added to the query we were now able to add a probability score to each query. P(conversion|query) = number of times the query resulted in a conversion / total number of times the query was made. We were able to attach this score to each query that was made. Finally we were able to fetch the pairs of interest (a,b) where the edit distance EDIT_DISTANCE(a,b) was greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3 and the probability score of b was greater than A. The graphic below shows this entire flow for a few events. The above example shows the sessions of three users and how we filter a correct autocorrection pair (aarow, arrow) from those events. The pair (diagram, graphic) was rejected because the edit distance was high, (stencil, aarow) was rejected because the probability score of conversion was low for arrow. When we did this across a week of events, the approach yielded some pretty impressive results. This was a small sample of output for the possible corrections of facebook: (“afcebook”, “facebook”), (“faacebook”, “facebook”), (“fabook”, “facebook”), (“faacebook”, “facebook”), (“fabook”, “facebook”), (“facaebook”,”facebook”) To add more signals to the value of our pairs, the frequency of times a pair occurred was also considered to be an important metric. Pairs that occurred only once within the window of a month were dropped out from the final list. These suggestions were highly relevant, and targeted typos while adding a ton of value for all of our users. We were also able to capture corrections associated with trending events such as ‘memorial day’ and all the possible typos as a result of it while avoiding wasteful combinations that did not occur and had no chance of typographic errors. We were able to run the data extraction as described above with an extraction window size of 2 months resulting in close to 32000 corrections for one of our locales. One thing that we were worried about was the presence of incorrect suggestions such as “cat” -> “cot” - both of these words had an edit distance of 1 and in the time window that we used, “cot” had a higher probability score than “cat”. To test the accuracy of our autocorrection a small test percentage of traffic was directed to the autocorrect feature to see the number of times suggestions were surfaced vs. rejections. The blue timeseries chart shows the number of times autocorrections were surfaced within a given window. The rejections were barely visible but they are the red lines on the bottom of the graph ( occurring 0.1 - 1% of the time). These are good results. However we want the rejections to asymptote towards zero in the long term. To help achieve this, we plan to use the rejection data captured from user events to demote corrections to suggestions instead and if they still perform poorly, remove them from the configuration altogether. We plan to regularly run our extraction data pipeline for autocorrection which will capture current autocorrection pairs and append them to the existing config. During this time we will also scan for rejections and remove them. There’s still plenty of work ahead for us in building this system but we’ve made some good first steps. Another side benefit of building an autocorrect system this way is to avoid any sort of human curation for the (query, correction) pairs as the system will create and refine them continuously. We currently have autocorrection deployed for all users of English speaking locales with plans to expand to other locales soon. Our data extraction currently runs in a jupyter notebook and most of the logic is single threaded thus limiting the size of our window. We are currently planning to run the data extraction job with Apache Spark so that we can extract and compute most of the logic in parallel which will also enable a bigger window of extraction for user generated events. A bigger window of maybe 6 months would result in better autocorrection quality across the range of vocabulary. As a company one of our values is to “Make complex things simple”. A lot of this comes down to removing all the obstacles that get in the way of enabling our highly creative customers to build great designs that help communicate their thoughts. We believe our data-driven autocorrection system for Canva’s search helps move the needle in that direction. Building autocorrect for Canva is the effort resulting from the culmination of engineers and data scientists including Glen Pink , Will Radford , Paul Tune and myself .

{"website": "Canva", "title": "My internship experience at Canva", "author": ["\nLara Matyushenko\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/my-internship-experience-at-canva/", "abstract": "After graduating from State University of Management and getting a Specialist’s degree in Advertising in 2011, I worked as an account manager in international advertising agencies. I worked as a kind of buffer between clients and the agency, making sure projects ran on time and on budget and building a strong relationship with clients. This also included coordinating progress across creative and software development teams. I was lucky enough to work in a creative industry and on a broad range of tasks, for example websites, mobile apps and CRM systems. Yet the more digital projects I worked on, the more I became interested in software development. I started learning programming online, which helped to solidify my desire to make a career change. Eventually last year I enrolled at the University of Technology, Sydney, and moved to Australia to pursue a Master’s degree in IT. As soon as my second semester began, I started researching job opportunities for the summer break. Canva was always top of my list. I found out about the company when I participated in a #SheHacks hackathon, where Sasha Morrissey, one of Canva’s engineers, happened to be a mentor. She explained to me what Canva as a tool is capable of, and it amazed me how easy it was to use and what possibilities the platform opened for people and businesses to create designs without the need for complicated graphics editors. I read up online about the company’s values , such as Being a Good Human and Empowering Others, and they resonated with me a lot. I love the current trend of content democratization, for example in film making and song producing, and I see Canva’s mission to ‘democratize design’ as part of this wider movement. I instantly knew I’d like to be part of this, especially since my previous experience managing creative advertising campaigns and developing tools for businesses aligned perfectly. I applied online and within a month heard back from a recruiter requesting my academic transcripts. I provided the documents, then I was invited for a screening tech interview over the phone. I found out I passed the first round, and the following week I had my second coding interview led by an engineer from my potential team. That interview took around one hour. Within a couple of days I received an email with the offer to become a front-end engineering intern! Needless to say, I didn’t hesitate to accept it. Way before my first working day I was nicely surprised when a parcel from Canva arrived on my doorstep, and I found a greeting card and heaps of branded swag inside. My internship cohort The first week of my internship was full of onboarding sessions and workshops. Co-founders Melanie, Cliff and Cameron introduced all the new interns to Canva’s vision, values and deeper details about what the company is aiming for in the future. We were all taken through an overview of Canva’s engineering values, teams and ways of working. Both frontend and backend interns found out what debugging and testing tools their teams use on a daily basis. It was a lot to take in within a couple of days, but it all started to make sense as soon as I began working on real problems. On my very first days I worked on real tasks, which affected real users. They were not huge, but just doing that definitely helped me to start feeling more comfortable with the codebase, tech stack and git workflow. The biggest challenge was the size of the codebase—when you complete assignments for uni or do your own side projects, you build them from scratch and you eventually gain familiarity with that code. At first it was overwhelming to try and figure out which parts of the application depend on one another, and hard to believe that at some point I’d learn to navigate through them. Fortunately I have a mentor, Christian, who is always there to give me context or help to get me unstuck when I encounter a confusing issue. That being said, I tend to do my best to find my own solutions before asking for assistance. Even if I don’t manage to solve the problem, at least I will understand it better and have more context before asking for help. I believe pair programming and mentoring are extremely helpful and effective ways for newbies of any level to skill up quickly in a new role. Despite the fact that Canva has over 500 employees across 3 countries, it feels like it still has a startup mindset, and things change rapidly. For some people the pace might not be ideal, but I came from the advertising industry, where ad hoc projects are the norm, and honestly I feel like a fish in water. Since each team at Canva can set its own goals (as long as they align with main direction) everyone plays an active role and creative role in building long term value for users. The lack of a rigid hierarchy is another thing which really appeals to me. It gives me a sense of autonomy, yet responsibility at the same time. With time I’ve learnt who among my engineering colleagues specializes in which areas of the platform. During my internship I’ve never felt that any of my questions was silly or inappropriate, or been told that I was not supposed to know something because of my junior temporary position. I know that I can ask anyone anything, and at the very least I’ll be redirected to someone who can help me. When I started my search for internships in Sydney, I came up with an action plan. I found this list of ideas really helpful for keeping myself on track. Here are my tips: Once all your hard work pays off and you receive that desired offer letter, it’s time to get the most out of your internship! Want to intern at Canva?

{"website": "Canva", "title": "How we’re making your Canva Prints environmentally-friendly 💚", "author": ["\nJim Towle\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/print-sustainability/", "abstract": "With our print partners Medio Pliego in Mexico. Launched in 2017, Canva Print offers an end-to-end solution for our amazing community of designers. With just a couple of clicks from within the Canva editor, anyone can bring their designs to life as professional hard copy prints, delivered straight to their doorstep in a couple of days. Today, Canva Print is available in 44 countries including the US, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, as well as across Europe and Southeast Asia, where millions of unique business cards, letterheads, posters, invitations and flyers are being designed and delivered each day. We’ve also started to roll out print-on-demand T-shirts in the US—opening the door to ever more expressive designs to suit every style. When it comes to choosing the right print partners and suppliers for Canva however, it’s not just about finding a company which is happy to negotiate at the right price. I’m looking to collaborate with people who share the same drive for excellence and customer success—because we want everyone to enjoy their hard copy prints as much as their digital designs. Another non-negotiable requirement is that our print partners embrace the same values when it comes to adopting environmentally-friendly and sustainable practices. When you look at the number of hard copy prints Canva delivers, whether on paper or apparel, you can see how important it is to reduce the impact we have on our planet by reducing our environmental footprint. Savvy customers demand and expect companies to have an environmentally conscious production line, and are likely to choose a company that is transparent with their supply chain practices. People want to know where a product came from, from where the cotton is sourced and who picked it, all the way to the factory and the final point of sale. On the flipside, what this means is that any lack of transparency has the potential to create a negative image for the brand. So it makes both dollars and “sense” to look for print partners who are as invested in offering a sustainable supply chain as we are. With our print partners RPI, Inc in Kennesaw, GA. As a major player of the print-on-demand category, we take our responsibility to the earth and to our supply chain very seriously. We do this by: There are many players in this industry, and who we choose to partner with is a difficult decision we don’t make lightly. In this blog, I’ll share the approach behind how Canva selects its print partners. But first, let’s look into the problem with waste in our industry. Historically, the print industry was governed by clients requiring large bulk runs—typically orders in the thousands for brochures and books. What this meant was that any revision to the end product—be it minor or major edits—would mean that old prints were no longer relevant and would require reprints to update to the newest versions. The old material would have to be disposed of (though hopefully recycled), especially if there was no other way to repurpose this material for another use.\nAs time went on, companies started to see a direct correlation between operational costs and revisions to print merchandise. The realization was clear—we needed to find a way to run smaller print batches to reduce waste. Customer demand has been trending to shorter, frequent and personalized print projects for a while now, so the print industry had to start accommodating demand through better supply chain, logistics, and print technology—and so print-on-demand was born. In theory, waste is minimized through the print-on-demand process and everything should be alright. But the truth is, without looking into the day-to-day workings of every process within the supply chain, waste is still a problem. This is why it’s important for us to dive deeper into how each print order is fulfilled. We handpick our print partners for Canva based on a multitude of factors. Every decision - from the products we produce, suppliers of materials, supply chain, manufacturing partners and shipping carriers are considered against our values. Doing the right thing when it comes to the environment is hard work, but we believe it’s a critical responsibility. We look into 3 key areas when considering who to partner with: One of the things we look for in our partners is that they are equipped with state of the art machinery. Modern equipment typically equates to better quality, fewer production setups, and has been optimized for less wastage in the print process For example, on the paper production side, we look for partners who use HP Indigo digital presses. HP boasts a global presence which means we can standardize our print platform around all markets we operate in, ensuring our customers everywhere can expect the same premium color quality. When it comes to our custom tshirt offering, we choose partners with Kornit Digital equipment for the same reason—finished products that meet our high quality standards. Both HP and Kornit have a strong sustainability policy that mirrors ours. It’s important for us to find partners who have existing relationships with their supply chain. When it comes to how and where our raw materials are sourced, transparency is key, as we have a responsibility to ensure they have the right sustainability certifications and fair labour practices. For example with our apparel offering, we choose Hanes as our T-shirt supplier. Not only do they have a strong product catalog, they also have a strong, proven environmental and corporate sustainability strategy in place. “Hanes Brands strives to expand its use of sustainable materials in its products, including cotton yarns made from spinning technologies that require less energy to manufacture, recycled cotton fibers derived from cut fabric waste, and recycled polyester filament yarns and fibers, both from plastic bottles. The company has a decade of experience in using recycled PET in its products and, during this time, has fine-tuned manufacturing processes to incorporate recycled fibers without impact to quality. Recycled polyester is used in all of the company’s fleece products and in cotton-polyester EcoSmart T-shirts sold to screen printers. Annually, Hanes brand products contain 6 million pounds of recycled materials. In 2017, Hanes achieved a landfill diversion rate of 84 percent, recycling more than 118 million pounds of fabric-cut parts, corrugate, plastic and other materials. By monetizing its dynamic recycling program, along with cost savings from energy reductions, the company created Green for Good – a unique philanthropic effort that takes environmentalism to the next level by combining it with community improvement and volunteerism. Since the program’s inception, more than 11,000 employees have donated 420,000 hours to complete nearly 70 distinct projects supported by $2.5 million in company funding. Projects have included school and hospital refurbishments, medical clinics, clean water projects, tree plantings and beach cleanups, among others.” —Excerpt from Hanes website One of the great things about today’s digital printing process is that setup waste is drastically minimized. Traditionally wastage of 10-15% is factored into traditional offset printed orders. So for example, if you wanted 10,000 brochures, a printer would factor in an additional 1000-1500 prints to ensure the machine is set up properly for color quality, and to accommodate for errors with trimming and binding. Digital printing reduces the need for set-up waste as there is a drastically less need for machine setup and bindery waste. With lean manufacturing principles, we’re looking out for waste areas such as the example above. In addition, we also review the entire process, looking for ways to improve the manufacturing workflow, reduce reprints and reworks, the way packaging is assembled, where materials are stored and how technology is used to help identify the location of each order throughout the factory. Experience in the print-on-demand industry is crucial. The ability to fulfill bulk and single orders at the same time is not something that can be easily done without an in-depth understanding of the needs of each customer. We need to consider whether our partners have the processes in place to cater to multiple, small, individualized orders and the ability to expedite delivery for each customer. This is immensely different to printing 20 huge jobs in one day—we need companies which can manage tens of thousands of orders each day, and are also able to cater to unique individual orders. We have moved from a timeframe of days or weeks for a project to a timeframe of just hours as our customer demands change. Customers want highly customizable and individualized print projects with ability to order what they want when needed. We also make it a point to work with regional print partners to reduce transit shipping costs and to ensure customers’ deliveries reach them faster. The rule of thumb here at Canva is to provide as much accuracy and transparency within our supply chains as possible. We believe this will also help reduce our long-term overhead costs and improve efficiency in the long run. The truth is that it’s not all just about reducing waste. It’s about making decisions across the entire process—raw materials, distribution, supply chain, production, transportation and recycling. As a consumer, you should have the choice to align your purchase decisions with companies that share your opinion regarding the importance of environmental responsibility. We all know that the earth’s resources are not infinite, and while our company mission is to give anyone the ability to ‘Design Anything, Publish anywhere’, we need to be conscious of how this affects the world in which we live. A core value at Canva is to ‘Be a Force for Good’, and for us on the print team that means asking questions about where and how things are made, so we can help preserve this beautiful planet we all share.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Why Canva is challenging its HQ privilege, and how you can too", "author": ["\nAdam Schuck\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/challenging-hq-privilege/", "abstract": "Our three office locations as of 2019: Sydney, Manila and Beijing This week we renamed Canva’s largest Slack channels. Up until last week, Canva employees around the world missed out on valuable company-wide announcements that were inadvertently posted to #hq. Now that channel is called #sydney. We’ve also rebranded our #general channel to #team, so all of our employees from Beijing to Buenos Aires can follow important updates—without having to hear about what the Sydney team is eating for breakfast. These naming changes might not look like a big deal, but they’re part of a wider push at Canva: we’re moving towards a distributed team culture that makes our global team feel more included. When you’re based out of your company’s global headquarters, it’s easy to feel that you’re at the centre of the universe. But for your company to have the best chance of success, you need to let go of your “HQ privilege” and embrace an inclusive culture which recognizes that location is another aspect of diversity. Thanks to the internet and a new generation of cloud-based tools, it’s easier than ever for teams spread around the globe to collaborate. While Canva was born in Australia, today we have more than 500 team members across 3 offices (Sydney, Manila and Beijing), with plans to expand. Of course running effective distributed teams isn’t just about overcoming technical challenges. Having worked from Australia and New York for global giants like Google and Twitter—back when they were first coming to terms with the concept of distributed teams—as well as having founded several companies myself, I’ve learned that it takes a lot of effort to learn how to work as an inclusive team. It helps to view location as another axis of diversity and inclusion. When discussing diversity and inclusion we often talk about gender, race, age and sexuality, but where you are physically located can also have a huge effect on how included and empowered you are in a company. The language of “remote” versus “distributed” is really important, but typically not quite understood by people who haven’t lived it. Those at headquarters often forget that they have a massive role to play in making distributed teams work, which includes letting go of that ingrained “HQ” and “remote” office mentality. This kind of thinking immediately positions those working remotely as outsiders who need to work harder to feel included. This is admittedly something we still have a habit of at Canva when dealing with our Manila and Beijing offices; as we become increasingly distributed we’re working hard to address this. The recent renaming of our #hq Slack channel to #sydney is an example of this. It’s now consistent with our #manila and #beijing channels, and the rebranded #team channel encourages people to send their valuable updates to the whole global team. I’ve been on the “remote” side of the fence, where working outside HQ was a significant handicap which took a major toll on productivity. As Google’s first engineering hire in Australia back in 2005, I worked with people in Hyderabad and New York. Thanks to the tyranny of time zones, I would need to wait 24 hours for even the simplest of code reviews, with every back and forth slowing things down by another day. Minor issues could drag on for weeks. In the spirit of teamwork, and without the benefit of experience, I put the onus on myself to make this arrangement work. I started staying up until 6 a.m., just so I could get some synchronous interaction with New York. Meanwhile, my boss in Australia – the founder of Google Maps, Lars Rasmussen – would stay up until 3 a.m. so he could rubber stamp my code. Later in my career, I joined Twitter by way of acquisition. My team founded Twitter’s New York engineering office and we were the first engineering team outside of San Francisco, with the exception of TweetDeck. Again, working in a remote office was a handicap. If I needed to know how to start a server then I needed to ask someone in San Francisco. They would IM me the commands, to compensate for scarce documentation. Another time I was the only person outside of headquarters invited to a meeting, and the entire meeting happened without me. I spent that time frantically emailing and calling people in San Francisco, desperately trying to get someone to dial me in, with no success.\nMeanwhile, just like many other high-growth startups, a lot of “hallway” decisions were made during these early days of Twitter, and these decisions weren’t always communicated to the New York team. So what are the principles that underpin successful distributed teams? Firstly, it’s key to recognize that what’s necessary for a distributed team is actually valuable for all teams. Going back to Twitter, I couldn’t start the server because I needed to talk to someone in a different time zone. What I really needed was documentation, so I could be more self-sufficient. It turns out, having access to documentation is valuable for every team member, not just to those in other offices. There are tons of examples of this. I recently learned this is called the “curb cut” effect , after the practice of cutting a ramp into the curb at an intersection so you don’t need to step down onto the road and then up again when you get to the other side. Initially curb cuts were intended to help people in wheelchairs, but they ended up benefiting lots of people – those riding a bicycle or pushing a stroller, or those with impaired vision. Something which is critical for one group often turns out to be valuable for everybody. Another principle is favouring asynchronous practices within your organization, making it possible for people to work effectively in their own time zone without a reliance on synchronous interactions. Make it easier for your people to work from any city in the world, and you’ve also made it easier for the people in your office to work from home, from the road, or work unusual hours. This is especially valuable for people with families. Adopting asynchronous practices gives your team autonomy, but it requires a high-trust and high-communication environment and a team of responsible individuals. Some examples of Canva’s asynchronous practices: It’s important to adopt this kind of distributed-friendly culture before you establish a distributed team. Otherwise, it tends to put the burden on the new office to effect change. One great example of how we do this at Canva is we record all company-wide and engineering talks and make them accessible to anyone in the company. This practice is valuable straight away for all local employees who may be on vacation or out sick, in order to catch up, which as we become more distributed makes it easier for all employees worldwide to stay connected. A big part of making this all work is transparency and communication, which in turn builds trust. If you don’t have transparency, even within a single office, you hear people utter phrases like “why wasn’t I in the meeting?” This is exacerbated in a distributed team environment. A good way to address this is by trying to become a hive mind (where once one person knows something, everyone knows something) and share information by default. If you learn something valuable, make sure your team finds out about it. Three words my Canva team are probably already sick of hearing me say are “proactive written communication”. This to me is the cornerstone – not just saying information, but writing it down, and not waiting to be asked for information, but sharing proactively. This includes ensuring everyone knows what everyone else is working on. Many teams at Canva use “Slack Shares” to keep each other on the same page. At my last company we had a Slack channel called #worklog. Whenever you switch to working on something new, you write a single sentence in the Slack channel. There’s no conversation, just push updates like “I’m working on the new foo widget” or “I’m having a sales meeting”. One of the things this does is help people identify when they’re working on the same task at the same time, and should talk to each other. Concise communication is crucial via every channel and to mitigate “information overload”, I encourage the author of any updates to value their audience’s time. Spend a few extra minutes to make your communications shorter and easier to digest. Tip: when writing long emails, start with a 1 line summary, and bold key points. Instead of writing a solid 10-page email and expecting everyone in the company to read it, use techniques like adding summary points at the top. For example: “tl;dr: if you use the test harness, you need to update your code” and then more detail. Putting important points in bold, including people’s names, can also help readers navigate through the text. This approach of valuing proactive, written communication can also shape your hiring profile to benefit your global team as it grows. In the beginning of any new office, you need to err on the side of self starters and strong communicators or else it becomes very easy for those outside the largest office to become out of sight and out of mind. At Canva, we are increasingly using video conferencing between offices to keep teams connected. If you want people to feel included and that everybody’s voice is heard then, as a company, you need to invest in lowering the barrier to starting a conversation. Our Canva Manila and Sydney teams brainstorming together over video. One of the things we did at my previous startup was establish a permanent video conference link between the offices in Sydney and San Francisco. Our daily stand ups would run in a virtual circle around the already-connected video conferencing TV. This always-on connection had the added benefit of while coding during the day you could call out “Hey Jeremy” to a person in San Francisco to ask “why do we use this library instead of that?”. At this point you could both wheel your chairs over to the screen and have a high-bandwidth real-time conversation, rather than talking past each other using tools like Slack. We experimented with the hardware and the software on both ends to get clear audio and a great user experience. In particular, audio clipping and unreliable network connections can exclude people from having their voice heard in key meetings. Those outside of HQ tend to feel the burden of this issue asymmetrically, yet generally have a harder time influencing hardware decisions in other offices, so ensure the responsibility to invest in reliable video connections is distributed. As part of Canva Sydney’s upcoming move into our new office, our Internal Infrastructure team has carried out a major upgrade to our video conferencing setup, from redesigning our network to investing in new hardware for each meeting room. We expect the result to be a seamless end-to-end experience from making video calls to sharing content with our distributed team. Regardless of how effective your communication channels are, travel is another really important tactic for building strong distributed teams. Even if you implement all these other approaches, like always-on video conferencing, meeting in-person is still a valuable component of building relationships and working together. We regularly invite our Canva Manila teams for workshops in Sydney to iterate on tools that we’ve built in-house. Oftentimes, this meeting can be the first time that the people building the tool and the people using the tool are able to actually sit down together in the same room. Some members of our Sydney team and Manila team workshopping together in Sydney. To build a strong connection it’s really valuable to understand each other as humans, not just as co-workers. Visiting each other’s offices and home cities, bonding over meals, and meeting colleagues’ families all help build empathy and a deeper connection that helps us work together. You also need to learn about different cultures and communication styles. Australians, Americans, Filipinos – we all have our differences. It’s my responsibility to change how I communicate with others, not just expect others to become extroverts so they can talk with this loud-mouthed Australian. The biggest mistake that businesses can make when it comes to managing distributed teams is not being proactive about creating an inclusive culture and developing distributed-friendly practices. After this, the second biggest mistake is embracing distributed processes but letting the responsibility rest solely on the new team. It shouldn’t fall on your new team in China to lobby for the video units in your Sydney office to be upgraded so they can interact effectively. Nor should it always fall on them to travel to the your office to strengthen relationships; the responsibility to travel needs to be shared. Canva employees from Sydney and Manila spending time together in the Manila office. The team at our Canva China launch event. One of the keys to success is having support all the way from the top in your company. If the company doesn’t truly believe in distributed teams, then anyone who is pushing for these changes is going to be fighting an uphill battle. Being a distributed team is increasingly important to Canva, as the majority of Canva’s users are now non-English speakers. As our user base rapidly becomes more global, our employee base is also becoming more global, with increasing numbers of employees outside of our Sydney office. We’re adapting, but we acknowledge that we haven’t got it all figured out yet. We have a lot of inertia based on having been historically a predominantly Sydney-based company. We are embracing the fact that we’re a distributed team and we want to make everyone feel included in that team, as we progress on our journey of empowering the world to design.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Creating a goal-driven culture at Canva", "author": ["\nMelanie Perkins\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/creating-a-goal-driven-culture-at-canva/", "abstract": "It seems silly that a ‘goal driven’ company is even a concept worth talking about, writes Canva CEO and cofounder Melanie Perkins. Surely everyone working in a company is aligned towards a common goal? But getting a 5 year old startup with hundreds of team members across 3 offices to work towards the same vision isn’t as easy as it sounds. In this post she explains how she’s building a goal-driven company culture at Canva. Since our earliest days, my cofounders and I have placed a lot of emphasis on the culture that we want to create at Canva. It has always been incredibly important that we build a company that we enjoy working in ourselves. Canva’s culture is about creating a place where everyone loves coming to work, and where everyone is striving to do the best work of their lives and create the most outstanding product and company we can. This means we don’t have any rules for the sake of having rules, we have high standards and we care about each other and enjoy hanging out together. What this meant is we had to start out by asking ourselves what we didn’t want at Canva. We didn’t want any arbitrary rules or autocratic powers. We especially didn’t want anyone waiting around for others to give ‘permission’ or a earn a promotion before they took on new responsibilities. We wanted everyone at Canva to be the master of their own destiny, and understand that this is the place where everyone can shape our company and culture, and do their best work. A place where if people see a problem, they can go and fix it, and everyone’s energy is focused on achieving crazy big goals together. In 2016, we did an exercise in which we put up our goals as posters on the wall. At that time, I wrote an email to the whole company: Part of an email I wrote to the company in 2016 We’ve done a really good job retaining the close-knit team feeling of our early days. But a lot has changed since then, so the company needs to adapt as well. We now have more than 500 people across three offices, so the way we worked early on, as one big team, is no longer possible. In late 2015 we shifted to a model of small startups: teams of three to six people with their own goals and plans. We celebrate each team reaching its goal as a whole company to maintain that closeness, but this new structure enables our teams to move as quickly as we can. Keeping everyone aligned is a huge task in itself, but I’ve learned a couple of things along the way to help this happen—so I thought I’d share them here. Checking out Canva’s newest office in-the-making This one seems kind of obvious—but one of the most critical parts of my role has always been to dream up crazy big goals. Now that Canva has reached this scale, I’ve been working hard to ensure that every team at Canva is also dreaming big for itself. We’re about to move into a huge new 8-story building, and before we started our renovations I walked through the building. It was both scary and exciting. Exciting because in the not-too-distant future the building will be filled with amazing people—and scary because within every team and every group, we need people dreaming about the future of their projects and the company and then working hard every day to turn those dreams into reality. One of the most useful things we’ve done recently was to have 15 offsites with each of our groups where we brainstormed about the future. Each day was tailored to the needs of the group—but one of my favourite sessions was dreaming about the future we want to turn into reality—what does ‘wild’ success look like in 3 years? What does terrible failure look like? Having this shared dream for the future means that everyone can work hard every day to turn those dreams into reality. Every team, every group and certainly every startup should spend a lot of time thinking about these sort of questions: A drone obstacle race to celebrate the launch of Canva Android. It’s not enough just to have ‘dreams’, a vision for the future that you’d like to create—you have to talk about it regularly to help will it into existence. I definitely learnt this the hard way when we were pitching for our first round of funding. We didn’t have a product and certainly didn’t have any customers for Canva at that point (although we certainly had a lot of experience with our first company Fusion Books), so it was absolutely essential that we were able to convey the vision for Canva in a compelling manner to land our first round of investment. Talking about our vision and the future we’re trying to create has continued ever since—every time we have newbies start we run through the Canva pitch deck, every Season Opener we reiterate the vision, every stand up, every board meeting… every given opportunity! Yes, that does mean that I have run through our pitch deck thousands of times—but the benefit is that everyone has a deep understanding of why we’re doing what we are doing, and then are able to help build upon that vision and help turn it into reality! This is hopefully 101 for most businesses—but to have a goal driven culture, it’s essential that the whole company is striving towards a larger shared vision, something much bigger than where you are today. The bigger the vision, the easier it is to have a goal driven culture—as each ‘goal’ is simply a step towards that bigger mission. It’s important to dream together as a team and to have a shared understanding of where you’re headed. Once you’ve nutted out the bigger picture, it’s much easier to work out the smaller decisions. So every time a newbie joins the team, my co-founders and I meet with them and run through our vision for Canva. It’s also a great opportunity for them to ask any questions and understand why we are doing what we are doing. This shared context helps them to make great decisions through their work and help us achieve those crazy big goals! Every time someone new starts at Canva we run through Canva’s pitch deck and vision to ensure that everyone knows the huge goals we are striving to achieve as a company. We often say that things in the future require ‘low fidelity’ detail—we may only have a few mockups or rough sketches to explain a concept a few years away, but as things come closer to fruition they need to be turned from low fidelity to high fidelity. High fidelity prototypes are as ‘real life’ as possible, so everyone can see what the finished product will look like and how it will work. We aren’t there yet on all fronts—but we’re making progress! Growing a startup there are always two realities that you have to constantly balance—the future utopian state where everything is magical and seamless, and the current dismal reality where you never have enough people or time, the product is never where you dream it to be and you’re embarrassed by every bug. That may sound negative or even a bit depressing, but I think dreaming up a beautiful utopian future and then struggling hard to get there is actually the weird delight of building a high-growth company. The difference between the future and the current state is actually what I find inspiring—turning dreams into reality. Inside Canva we frequently say we’re less than 1% done. In one of our brainstorming sessions recently someone asked me ‘if we reach 1% is that success or failure?’ I had to think for a moment—hopefully we’ll reach 100% of our current vision at some point, but every single day we’re just thinking ‘future, future’ so hopefully we never quite get there! A lot of companies (even some very large tech ones…) have a ‘short’ ladder—they set out to do something, reach their initial goal of getting a lot of user traction, and then in some ways have an identity crisis… what to do next? Other companies have huge lofty dreams—but don’t have tangible steps to get there. I think the ‘ideal’ vision ideally comprises both—a huge vision that stretches all the way to the moon and will takes decades to achieve, but then a lot of small tangible steps along the way. The composition of a vision (slideshow) At Canva every team chooses a ‘big goal worthy of celebration’ every three months, and when they reach that goal they have a fun (often rather quirky) celebration with the rest of the company. Why does having a ‘goal worthy of celebration’ matter? Because it can take 2 to 6 months to meet a challenging goal, celebrations are important as they help everyone acknowledge each other’s wins. For example an engineer might not know when to congratulate the Customer Happiness Team—but if they set a huge goal, explain why it’s important to the company and then hit it, everyone will be barracking for them and can congratulate them when they get there. By setting crazy big goals in a public manner there’s a common language and understanding across every team. When we were much smaller, our goals looked more like ‘launch Canva’, and the whole company would work towards that end. Today we are fortunate to have surpassed 500 team members, so it’s more important than ever to take a step back to and ensure we all know which goals we’re working towards. We go to a lot of effort to ensure that each team’s goals are visible to the whole company—we stick them on posters on the wall, we send an email around, we speak about them at our Season Opener. By making the goals public, it enables everyone to know what’s most important and to strive towards the goal together! The Season Opener marks the start of the new season and quarterly team planning. For one day each quarter, the office is completely transformed into a new world—some of our past themes have included: autumn fairytale forest, spring carnival and most recently, Canvastock - a colorful, fun 70s theme. Everyone gets actively involved, and Season Openers allow us to get big visibility for our quarterly goals, share context across the company and celebrate team achievements and milestones. Over the years we’ve had a lot of different ways of making our goals public - including painting them on large canvases! (If you look closely, this one describes an old goal of hiring 30 people in a season) When we were working on a large project with lots and lots of moving pieces, we had a games board where each character represented a team’s goal they were hoping to land. At our Season Openers, each team presents their ‘big goal worthy of celebration’. One type of big goal is a launch goal—for example last year, one team’s goal was to ‘launch in 100 languages’, another team’s goal was to ‘launch Canva Print’, while another was to ‘launch Canva Android’. Other teams may have a business metric goal, for example to ‘increase the number of people who publish their design within 7 days from X to Y’, or to ‘double the conversion rate from X to Y’. Our Social Media team’s goal was to hit ‘five minute response times’. After nailing that, their new goal is to create 1,000 awesome custom responses with Canva designs so that when people tweet us, they get a cool Canva response back. Our Vibe team’s goal in Sydney is to open a new office building, while ensuring Canva is as eco-friendly as we possibly can be . These ‘big goals’ help ensure that every team has clear objectives to work towards, that each team feels recognition from the whole company when they reach their goal, that we celebrate our wins along the way and also provide a common language for everyone across the company to use regardless of how diverse their day-to-day work might be. I love that every single team and group at Canva has ‘crazy big goals’. Having new goals each season makes sure everyone has something concrete to pour their energy and creativity into. Team goals written on posters on the wall People sometimes ask ‘do you sit back and pinch yourself’ or ‘what does it feel like to be successful’? Truthfully I seldom sit back, I and certainly don’t feel that ‘we’ve made it’—I always see the 99% that we haven’t yet achieved. The huge mountain left to climb. I always feel like we are inadequate compared to the beautiful utopian future that I’d like to create. On the flip side, I love reading tweets from our community and hearing about the impact that we are having. So how do you create a company structure that focuses on goals instead of titles? One that encourages teams to collaborate instead of hoarding information? This is a question that we’ve been thinking about a lot over the last few years. It’s essential to get it right, or we literally couldn’t take on the crazy big goals that we’ve set out to achieve. The issue with titles is that they are very rigid—if you were the Director of Marketing a couple of years ago for example, you would have just been directing yourself and your projects at Canva. But now we have 100 people playing a role in marketing, from PR to Communications, Social Media management, email marketing and more. We started 2018 with 300 people, and we’re now at 500 and expect to have doubled the team again by the end of 2019. In other high-growth companies that I have spoken to, they talk about the ‘tour of duty’, where people ‘at the top’ will generally only last a few years before not being able to perform at the level required as their company has grown. This feel like a pretty big pitfall of a rigid title system. So instead of focusing on titles that are most likely going to be outdated as our company grows, we focus on goals - for example doubling the number of users acquired through a certain channel. As people grow in experience they may be able to take on harder and harder goals, support other people to reach their goals and explore more complex or ambiguous goals. Rigid titles work well in environments that aren’t changing very much, but when goals, teams and team sizes are constantly evolving and changing, it’s essential to focus on goals instead. We rely on every team member to identify new ways of doing things better. All suggestions are welcomed, regardless of job function or tenure. We actively solicit ideas from everyone to improve the way we work and create value for our users, whether it be facilitating project retrospectives, or implementing different tools or technologies. On a company level, we encourage people to get involved in any area they feel passionate about, whether it be within their Specialty area, or through a special interest groups that drive larger initiatives across the company, like Diversity & Inclusion or Parenting. In a lot of companies there is an idea that there is a fixed pie to be divided, that in order to get ahead you have to compete with your peers and optimise your piece of the pie.\nThere are many types of pie—from the the ‘power’ pie to the ‘responsibility’ pie and the ‘money’ pie. However, as a company we have ridiculously huge ambitions and crazy big goals—so there’s certainly enough responsibility to go around for everyone! Create a culture that grows the pie (slideshow) Everyone is a shareholder at Canva—so growing the company means everyone’s piece of the pie expands. As we’ve shaped Canva over the years, we’ve always wanted to ensure that everyone’s energy is focused on expanding the pie, rather than fighting for a bigger part of it. There are so many ways that companies accidentally create a culture that causes people to concentrate on in-fighting instead of expanding the pie. For example: A better kind of hierarchy In a rapidly growing company you are never, ever ‘done’. You have never learnt enough skills or developed enough expertise that you can stop developing and learning. As soon as you unlock one skill, you are standing before the next challenge that is looming above you and you know that you will have to learn a hell of a lot of new skills in order to tackle it. We want to ensure that the need for continuous skill development is baked into our company structure and DNA, rather than people feeling like they can be complacent and stop learning. I love this quote: Good, better, best. Never let it rest. ‘Til your good is better and your better is best.\n—St. Jerome A few years back we anonymized and then amalgamated the information from everyone’s 360 degree feedback, and saw that almost all feedback fell into four buckets: Craft, Strategy, Communication and Leadership, and Coaching. People were either excelling in a particular area, or else they had room for skill development in that area. We recently launched the ‘Canva Pillars’ which describes the skills that we want to help everyone develop over their time at Canva, and that will enable them to achieve crazy big goals. The ‘Canva Pillars’ (click to enlarge) We’re starting to roll out training sessions and workshops to help to develop these skills in everyone across the company. We recently held our first workshops, and it was incredible to see people looking at areas of their own skill development and selecting areas they’d like to work on—‘I’d love to work on my communication’, ‘I’d love to improve my ability to rally others’ etc etc. This is the type of company I’m excited to be a part of—not one where everyone is trying to stand on each others heads to get to some illusionary top! It’s still a work in progress, and our culture and company structure will continually evolve over the years to come. But I certainly hope that we can maintain the focus on crazy big goals and skill development, fostering a sense of collaboration as we grow! What you choose to celebrate dramatically impacts your culture. At a lot of companies there is a strong emphasis on individualistic performance—for example, people getting a promotion. In fact, one very well known tech company had ‘promotion parties’ until recently. You can imagine that it probably didn’t build a lot of comradery and collaboration. At Canva there’s a strong need to collaborate within your team and then across teams to deliver an awesome experience to our customers—so our most fun, vibrant and memorable celebrations are around teams hitting their goals. When a team hits their ‘crazy big goal’, our whole company has a celebration with them. These are often quite quirky and fun - for example, we released doves when we ‘released’ Canva for Work, had a mini La Tomatina festival when we launched in Spanish and then painted an office mural of the word ‘creativity’ in 100 languages when we launched in 100 languages. Everyone wore black turtlenecks when we launched our iPhone app, and then had a Drone race when we launched our Android app… and so, so many more. Fun and quirky celebrations play a critical role at Canva. It means that when a team hits their goal, they feel recognition from the whole company. We have so many huge goals at Canva that it would be easy to reach a goal and hardly acknowledge it as we strive towards the next one. But by building quirky celebrations into our team culture, we’re able to ensure that the whole company takes a moment to appreciate how far we’ve come. Also because the whole company celebrates when a team hits their goal, it further emphasizes that a team’s success is the success of the whole company. A slideshow of Canva celebrations over the years As we now have 80+ teams at Canva, so we’ve started to put a lot more emphasis on groups of teams. We now have 15 groups of teams, and our goal is to ensure that each group can become the world’s best in their area. A healthy group has: Each team is run as a ‘little startup’ and has their own pitch deck. They are self-managed and have complete ownership over how they work—such as setting up team cadences (e.g. some teams do daily standups, while others do fortnightly sprints) and day-to-day management tools (for example Jira, Trello or Google Sheets). To ensure a common purpose and goal, each team articulates their mission and goals in a Team Strategy Document. This document also includes key projects, measures of success, roles and responsibilities and dependencies. All members of the team participate in the development of the team’s strategy. Each team also runs their own Team Health Check each season, which is a safe space to focus on open and constructive feedback, as well as strive for continuous improvement. It helps the team build self-awareness about what’s working and what’s not, and most importantly encourages the team pick up on issues or change course when needed—such as forecasting resourcing needs, or rethinking how to run meetings. It seems silly a ‘goal’ driven company is even a concept worth talking about, as surely the alternative would be quite dire. But unfortunately there are so many companies that don’t continually set goals to achieve, or figure out how to rally their resources around those goals in order to achieve them. Fortunately, there’s no shortage of big challenges at Canva to make goals around. And in our latest internal culture survey, a lot of people mentioned that they have felt empowered to take those challenges on. This was some of their feedback: More than anything, it’s comments like that which make me feel we’re on the right track. As we continue to grow, we’ll always invest in creating a transparent, close-knit feeling that we had when we were much smaller. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter who you are—everyone plays a vital role in meeting our company goals. For more details on our current job openings, visit Canva’s careers page here .

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Embracing the startup mindset", "author": ["\nGuy Kawasaki\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/embracing-the-startup-mindset/", "abstract": "Congratulations! You’ve taken the plunge and left your traditional 9 to 5 for a new job at a startup. After countless nerve-wracking interviews, you’ve signed on the dotted line and met up with the rest of your new team. Their drive and passion is contagious. You’re bubbling with newfound energy and looking forward to making a dent in the universe - nothing’s going to stop you, and it’s going to be great. Despite the promises of an exciting, fulfilling career ahead, throughout my career I’ve met a lot of people who have had a rough time with their first few months at a startup. In private conversations, there’s a common theme around shame of feeling unsettled and confused - especially from those who already have years and years of experience under their belt. While some of these people have manage to find their footing and get through this transition from corporate to startup, others don’t. In this blog post I’ll share my thoughts around what you can do to ensure a smooth transition from a larger corporation to startup. Speaking at a Season Opener event at Canva On paper (this was before LinkedIn), my résumé should not have gotten me an interview with Apple. My educational background was a bachelor of arts in psychology and a master of business administration in marketing. I had not taken a computer class—not that there were many computer classes back then.\nMy work experience was also seemingly irrelevant. After earning my MBA, I went to work for a fine jewelry manufacturer. I started out by counting diamonds and left five years later as vice president of sales and marketing. My only exposure to computers was using an IBM System to enter and access data.\nHow did I get a job in the tech industry? The simple answer was nepotism! My roommate from college hired me into the division. But then how did I succeed, without a computer science background or any significant work experience in tech? The answer is “a lot of determination and the willingness to learn along the way.” While on the firing line (there was no evangelism training program), I had to learn enough about programming to talk to techies and enough about marketing computers to talk to CXOs at software companies. As you can see it was a far cry from counting diamonds. So ultimately I had to embrace a set of character traits that is required to thrive in a startup - aka “the startup mindset”. It all boils down to this. The startup mindset is very, very different from the mindset you’ll see at most companies. It’s a mindset where the glass is half full. It’s a mindset of meritocracy. It’s not about hierarchy - it’s about whether you’re good or not and where you’re going, not where you’ve been. The startup mindset is one where you’re not so concerned about procedures and established roles, you’re going to do whatever it takes to get things done. The startup mindset means that you’re creative, you ask for forgiveness not permission, and you’re on a mission, you’re not simply trying to make a buck. You’re trying to dent the universe. If you do all that, you’ll be fine. This is the exact kind of mindset that separates a good startup culture from a bad one. Let me explain further. Giving a workshop on presentations for the team Most companies rely upon educational background and work experience to determine the acceptability of job candidates. The logic is that employees need a foundation of relevant knowledge and skills to succeed—or at least not make the hiring manager look bad. So why do some not perform at their peak when placed in t this new startup environment? From my experience in Silicon Valley, what separates a good startup from a bad one boils down to a team that is dedicated to constantly improving everything—products, service, customer support, onboarding and everything in between. There has to be a mentality within the company that isn’t siloed. For example, one’s job is not just about engineering or sales or marketing—everybody has a role to play in all these functions, and everyone needs to contribute to get the job done. One of the qualities of an employee who does well at a startup is that you think like an owner, in the sense that when you see something that’s wrong, you speak up and you correct it. When you see something being wasted, you speak up. If you see an opportunity, you seize it. In other words, you’re not saying, “I’m just an employee. My job is to do X, not Y and Z.” That’s not a startup, and that’s not an ownership mentality. Everyone needs to be in this together, and it starts with you. It’s important that you recognize that despite all the years of experience you bring to the company, there’s still a lot to learn. Despite that, you can’t spend weeks and weeks on onboarding and training - that’s not the nature of a startup. Although this can be challenging, a high-performance team in a startup consists of persistent go-getters raring to solve the problems ahead. At a startup you’re expected to move fast and experiment and iterate, again and again—and that’s okay. The nature of experiments means that oftentimes things will fail—that’s just how it is. So don’t be proud. The day after you start a job, nobody cares about your connections, history, and credentials—or lack thereof. You either deliver results, or you don’t. If you’ve worked for a large company in the past, it’s a very different world at a startup. But I think you might be delighted that you have the freedom to make things happen like you could never do before. You have freedom to move, to change, and to innovate. In a sense you’re the master of your own fate. When the dust settles, you’ll be glad you’re in a startup. With some of the Canva team When you work for a startup, things change fast. It’s not like there’s a three-year strategic plan, and that’s all you have to focus on. You have to be opportunistic: when a potential customer comes in, when potential new technology emerges, or a potential partnership with a large company arises, you have to grab it. Theoretically there might be a danger of changing too fast, but if you had to pick between changing too fast and not changing, you’ll need to take the first option every time. That’s what’s called a high-quality problem. Changing too fast is much better than having management, tradition or another department standing in the way of every change you’re trying to make. Whilst you have to change quickly, you don’t have to do it alone. In a startup, a valuable lesson is that giving stuff away, turning things down, and having other people help you is a good thing. There’s a really good blog post here about giving away your legos at work—a startup commandment that everyone should learn and adopt. It’s not about a territorial grab, it’s about a rising tide floating all boats. So don’t get territorial, and don’t try to possess things—set it free, and it’ll work out. This is not a Fortune 500 company where you have to protect your piece of turf and your little fiefdom. That attitude will not work at a startup. In the example of Canva, we don’t call it a day without setting some ambitious goals, and hustling to execute—so there is always something different to keep things fresh and challenging. That might mean that we rarely get our ducks perfectly in a row, but that’s a sacrifice we’re willing to make. Roles will be redefined.\nTeams will be reshuffled.\nProcesses will be broken.\nTimelines will be moved. What keeps the team going is the understanding that with high growth comes frequent change. We don’t concern ourselves with ideals. Instead, we adapt with a flexible mindset, and work to identify pragmatic solutions together. We live and play in a very dynamic space, and there are always plenty of opportunity to work on different parts and priorities of the business. The world is yours to shape. Resilience is a necessary skill at any startup. We’re in a fast-paced market, and there are a lot of challenges. But I dare say you’ll look back and say, “Wow, that was some of the hardest work I ever did, but also some of the best work I ever did. It was also some of the most enjoyable.” It’s a great feeling. So congratulations again on landing a job in a startup. It’s time to strap yourself into your seat. We’re on a rocket. We will dent the universe. This post was first published on Business Insider .

{"website": "Canva", "title": "What Marie Kondo can teach us about prioritizing the right work, and what to give away", "author": ["\nLiz McKenzie\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/what-marie-kondo-can-teach-us-about-work/", "abstract": "Hello. My name is Liz McKenzie, and I’m a hoarder. Clothes, shoes, bags, books and plenty of other miscellany fill my home, waiting for the perfect time in the future when I’ll be able to put them to good use. The problem’s gotten quite bad - my apartment has been hijacked by all my clutter, making it difficult for me to relax at home. The reason I’m laying it all out here is because the first, and often hardest step, is admitting you have a problem. Luckily for me, I haven’t gone too far down the rabbit hole. Slowly (and painfully) I’ve started to weed through the clutter, sorting it out into keep, sell, donate and throw piles. For extra motivation, I’ve set a goal of inviting friends over for dinner next month. I’ve also started to embrace tips from the decluttering expert, Marie Kondo. If you haven’t heard of Kondo, she’s been taking the world by storm with her Netflix series and self-help book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up , introducing smart tidying tips that anyone can put into practice. Kondo offers a simple, yet reasonable explanation of why a lot of us are in this mess (pun intended): we were simply never taught how to tidy. Decluttering also isn’t just about having a tidy home; the true value lies in being able to mindfully choose your possessions and having the ability to shape your environment to reflect the life you choose to live today. Serendipitously, I found myself in a similar place where I needed to reassess my workload. Being with Canva for over a year now, I’ve accumulated a lot of things - and I’m not talking about papers, emails, and various bits and bobs. It was time to evaluate my to-do list and my productivity: am I doing the best with what I have, and if not, what needs to change? I found myself wanting to be more deliberate in setting aside the headspace I needed so that I can embrace the constant change and ambiguity that often comes with many high-growth startups. And to do this, I needed to embrace ‘giving away my legos’. The term “giving away your legos’ is a startup concept that was coined by ex-Googler Molly Graham. Having experienced the chaos that is inevitable with rapid scale and growth, Graham introduced this concept to help others understand the uncertainty and pressure of wanting to do more with less - while thriving at the same time. Let me explain further. During the early stages of a startup, everyone is excited with the fun and opportunity of building new things. Everyone has so many different colored blocks to choose from, each piece potentially playing a crucial role in setting the foundations for this huge, amazing tower. Soon, we find ourselves getting overwhelmed - there is just too much to build and too many legos in front of you that need to be used. Soon, you decide to bring in more builders - and this is that weird moment in time where people start feeling something different… they start feeling nervous about how the other builders are using these legos - are they choosing the right colors? The right shapes? The right placement? When you use this analogy in the business space, it translates to the uncertainty and distrust of others: whether they are able to execute and follow through on your initial vision. Worse, if that builder is doing a great job, many start worrying that the new person will replace them and take over all the fun or important tasks. Graham uses this metaphor to raise awareness of the need to help people get through these emotions - because if you don’t, the results can be horrendous for the business, and have a negative impact on team morale. At Canva, we’ve also embraced this startup philosophy. Giving away our legos have allowed us to grow faster and meet our goals. Giving away responsibility — the part of the lego tower you started building — is the only way we can move on to building bigger and better things for our design community. The Canva team has doubled in size in 2018 alone. What I found during my decluttering exercise at home and my personal growth journey at Canva was that there were many similarities when it comes to striving to live and work harmoniously. As such, there are transferable skills based on these similarities that we can apply at home and in the workplace. “The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past.” ― Marie Kondo You can’t grow if you can’t let go. I once had a spin bike gathering dust at home. I hardly ever used it, but I knew it was there in case I felt the urge to exercise. And that was all it was - an old, bulky chunk of flywheel waiting for the day that never came. When I sold the bike, I signed up to a nearby gym instead. And because I was paying a monthly membership fee, I was more motivated to work up a sweat at a spin class. What this goes to show is the more clutter we collect, the less space we have for ourselves. When thinking about our to-do list, there is an opportunity cost. The more you add to your responsibilities, the less time you have to be able to get things done properly - and the more opportunities you may be missing out on to learn new skills and make an impact. “But when we really delve into the reasons for why we can’t let something go, there are only two: an attachment to the past or a fear for the future.” ― Marie Kondo There are some items at home I’ll never throw away. My wedding album. A trophy. A ring that belonged to my grandmother. Every time I come across these items they made me feel happy. But there are also other sentimental items around that don’t spark any special feeling when I see them. An old Christmas card, an old school uniform, an old laptop… the list was endless. I had kept them because I never thought about repurposing them or I felt it was just the ‘right thing to do’. According to Kondo, the best way to decide whether or not to keep something is to hold each item in your hand and decide whether it sparks joy. Joy is described as an uplifting feeling that you get; it has nothing to do with whether the item is practical or you ‘should keep it’. So applying this concept to our legos at work, it’s important to understand that many of us will naturally feel at odds with giving away some of our responsibilities, despite already having too much on our plate. We’ve worked many hours on the project, and spent many more thinking about the task. It is understandable that a sentimental connection has occurred, and letting go can be difficult. But this is a natural phase of growth and an ongoing journey. And it’s going to take time. But you can’t build another tower if you’re busy clutching too many legos. Our latest cohort of Canva newbies! Growing up, my mother kept a very tidy household - everything had its place and I never had to lift a finger to help. Because I never had the responsibility of tidying, I never learned how. In a business setting, newbies are often onboarded to a company with guidance on how to set up their workspace. They’re given a company dress code policy to help them decide what to wear, and maybe some tips on where to find the best coffee shops in the area. At Canva, we’ve spent a lot of time ensuring our newbie onboarding experience starts before they even set foot in our doors ! So why do we expect everyone to just know how to recognize when it’s time to give away their legos? Based on my experience, and inspired by Kondo’s teachings, here’s a 4-step guide on how to do it. “People cannot change their habits without first changing their way of thinking.” ― Marie Kondo At Canva, we expect our team members to grow as the company grows. What this means is that change is constant, and there are often new challenges to tackle, and new things to learn every day. We try to create a supportive working environment that truly sets everyone up for success. So it’s extremely important that we keep pushing ourselves and set goals that inspire us, because setting a goal that seems really challenging and then being able to actually accomplish it is one of the most satisfying things in the world. Ask yourself if you’re using your time and skills in the best way, and whether there’s something else that could benefit from your expertise and participation. This plays into the concept of ‘paying it forward’ - where someone before you had to let go of their lego so you can grow and shine; now it’s your turn to pay it forward. “We should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.” ― Marie Kondo Be careful of falling into the trap of simply giving away tasks you don’t enjoy. Finding joy in your work is about being able to recognize 3 key factors: Honest answers will help you figure out whether it’s time to give away your lego, and who the best person is to receive them, based on their capacity and capability. They may be able to benefit and learn from the opportunity. “Success is 90 percent dependent on our mind-set.” ― Marie Kondo New challenges come with a lot of experimentation along the way. When giving away your legos, expect to provide some leeway for others to transition into the role. The new owner will be using a lot of time learning and testing different hypotheses to figure out the best way to solve the challenges of the job. To keep everything on track, both parties will need to embrace the art of giving and receiving feedback. Timely and relevant feedback helps everyone stay on track and achieve their goals. Our internal performance coach Sarah Nanclares has written a great post outlining how we’re building a positive feedback culture - it’s both effective and empowering when everyone embraces feedback. It can become frustrating having to deal with failed experiments, but similar to Kondo’s advice on not interfering with or taking control of other people’s belongings, you need to let people make their own mistakes. Instead of interfering, encourage your team to take responsibility for their mistakes and empower them to be accountable and find a solution. “We need to show consideration for others by helping them avoid the burden of owning more than they need or can enjoy.”\n― Marie Kondo A lot of people confuse giving away your lego with one of two things: Once another person has assumed responsibility of a task, it’s incredibly important to allow them to own it fully so you shadow them. Shadow means stepping aside to allow others to lead the project - including owning the vision and goals. Your new role is to provide guidance. On the flip side, over-shadowing means you are still leading, but from the sidelines. This can cause confusion when it comes to ownership and accountability. I find the best way forward is to check in on progress by being a helpful observer. This means guiding without directing, and asking the right questions to ensure they’re on track. Try to refrain from micromanaging, especially if the outcome would likely be the same - this is a surefire way to create a supportive and empowering environment for everyone to flourish. Setting up regular check-ins can be helpful. Here are some questions you might want to use: Check-ins ensure any roadblocks are addressed and keep everyone in alignment. “No matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past. The joy and excitement we feel here and now are more important.” ― Marie Kondo Your work responsibilities really are like your possessions at home. Sometimes you need to keep them, sometimes you don’t. Of course not everyone has the luxury of being able to delegate and pass on their skills to someone else - but even for those of us who do, we often don’t always take the opportunity when we should. And all of us have some make-busy tasks, that feel like real work but really aren’t providing value for anyone. So while I can’t say I’ve mastered the art of tidying, I do know this: decluttering at home and at work is an ongoing process, and the first step is recognizing when it’s time to let go. Hopefully this blog will help inspire you to audit your to-do list, so every second of your time is spent on mindful productivity that sparks joy, is the most impactful task for the company you can be working on and brings out the best in you!

In this blog, she explains how you, too, can build a positive feedback culture in your organization. Work satisfaction is positively associated with one’s ability to make an impact in the company you work in, the team you work with, and an abundance of opportunities for career advancement. What is equally important, however, is the ability for a person to grow within the organization. Whether it’s through improving one’s technical or personal skills, the ability to hone one’s abilities and self-awareness ranks high up on the list in the pursuit of happiness at work. But what’s the best way for an individual to grow at work? Most companies today have huge training budgets allocated to internal/external workshops guaranteed to upskill. The next big conference promises to unveil the secrets to success. But what many companies are now starting to understand is the power of growth can be easily assessed from right within your company. And it’s through ongoing feedback from managers and peers. It’s an easy concept to grasp - the people you work with should have the best context on the expectations and skills required to thrive in your company, as well as an interest in helping you grow. Perhaps this is why equity options are appealing to many startups - Canva included - as we have demonstrated that our team at Canva are more empowered to think like an owner when each and every one of us has ‘skin in the game’. Meanwhile, leadership can rest assured they’re getting the best out of their team and everyone is striving to perform at their best. The attraction for a company in embracing a healthy feedback culture is straightforward. Feedback is intrinsically linked to improved performance. Not only does it have the power to make a positive impact to the company’s bottom line, but when people feel supported to grow and experiment in a safe environment, they’re also more likely to put their best foot forward and be a team player. Naturally, this realization in today’s modern workplace means we’re seeing a sharp increase in companies seeking to prioritize a healthy feedback culture. But why are many of us still struggling to create a healthy feedback environment? In this blog, I’ll share my tips on how to build the right foundations to set your team up for success through ongoing, mutual feedback: Let me start with a bit of background. Canva is already a close-knit organization of high performers, so for many on the outside, hiring an internal coach like me might seem like overkill. Yet for a high octane company like Canva, it’s vital to sustaining growth. When you think about how fast we’ve grown (from a handful of people when we first launched Canva in Sydney back in 2013, to over 400 around the world), what was once a company that could easily operate like a family now needs the right tools and environment to help navigate growth and performance. My role at Canva is to help coach the team towards this professional and personal growth. For this to happen, we needed to create a safe and welcoming environment that starts with everyone in the company understanding the benefits of a feedback culture, and embracing said environment. Let me explain. At Canva, we encourage everybody to strive to become the very best that they can be in their craft, strategic thinking, communication and leadership coaching skills. We know that by optimizing for this, it will bring enormous personal gratification and also extraordinary business results. The fastest way we do this is through actively promoting a robust feedback culture whereby asking and giving feedback is everybody’s business. The way to do this is to promote accountability for giving and requesting feedback. This is applicable to everyone in the company - whether you’re the CEO, an engineer, a product manager or an accountant - everyone is expected to ask for feedback regularly, and receive it just as often. An asker-driven approach means everyone is encouraged and expected to proactively seek regular feedback from their mentors, peers and anyone else who can provide valuable critique that is only accessible from a third party perspective. Running a tight ‘asker driven’ feedback culture works really well for us at Canva - and it might work for your organization too. The best thing about this is the fact that everyone can participate - it’s as easy as taking a deep breath and simply asking (see my tips below). Imagine these two scenarios: Regular feedback is a great way to help you grow professionally and personally; when coupled with regularity, it will only help you learn faster and improve for the better. This applies to everyone in the team - not just for newbies or juniors. For example, our leadership team is encouraged to be proactive with asking for feedback. What this means is that they are setting an example for everyone, which in turn helps strengthen a culture of feedback within Canva. At the end of the day, asking for feedback is a bit like exercising a muscle: the more you use it, the easier it becomes, and before you know it seeking regular feedback is no longer a scary task. In fact, it becomes welcomed. A good feedback ecosystem doesn’t end with a person being comfortable with asking for feedback - it’s also up to everyone to ensure feedback given is helpful and actionable . Feedback gets a bad rap because whether you are giving or receiving feedback, people can find it threatening, but it doesn’t have to be this way. The best way for everyone to adopt feedback (both as an asker and a receiver) is to understand that feedback is just a factual replay or recount of what happened. Nothing more. Nothing less. Ultimately, feedback is action-focused. It is all too easy for any feedback session to turn into finger-pointing, gossip or a place where people complain. Good feedback allows for people to reflect, and whilst at times that may end up in complaints, there needs to be a focus on healthy downloads that lead to actionable change. Creating a safe space to grow a culture for open feedback is more than having private meeting rooms for annual reviews, or online feedback forms for anonymous submissions. In fact, more often than not, this could be detrimental to establishing a welcoming environment for a feedback culture to flourish. What we’ve found working really well at Canva is putting an end to annual reviews, and encouraging regular feedback sessions instead. Our view is that feedback should be given to improve a specific area of performance, rather than tacked onto salary reviews or promotions. When feedback is asked for and received regularly, we found a boost in alignment when it comes to meeting our company goals (which in a fast paced startup like Canva, can move a mile a minute!). This plays well into our belief that people excel exponentially when they are crystal clear on how they’re doing on their given task, and how their professionalism and craft is making a positive impact on the company. A workplace that embraces a strong feedback culture has more room for both positive and constructive feedback. One of the most common misconceptions of feedback is that one can be more transparent when giving feedback anonymously. At Canva, feedback is an empowering tool both for the recipient and the giver - and can be something that helps both parties grow. When given anonymously, it creates an awkwardness that is unconducive to teamwork and can actually prove to be detrimental to the overall morale of the company. A safe space means that everyone is welcome to share and request feedback, in the understanding that we’re all growing and trying to achieve great things together. It’s a workplace where no one should feel ridiculed for needing more guidance; in fact the converse is more fitting - it’s a place where everyone should feel empowered to ask for support. How does this look in real life? All feedback (given or received) is welcomed, and we never punish anyone for speaking up. It’s important that we demonstrate this explicitly and implicitly - otherwise we could unknowingly create a standoffish atmosphere post feedback session. For example, non-verbal cues such as hands on hips or having them crossed can create an offensive and awkward environment. A strong, robust feedback culture can come in all shapes and sizes, and every company will shape their own uniquely. At Canva, our measure of success is seeing people grow as they identify what they care about, happily take on more responsibility and confidently set impactful goals that align with improved performance and productivity for the whole business.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Why we left manual UI testing behind", "author": ["\nJoscha Feth\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/automated-visual-testing-at-canva/", "abstract": "Visual regression testing is vital in a high growth tech startup like Canva to ensure any new code continues to work on our web application, whilst ensuring that visually, it looks just as good as before. In this blog, Canva engineer Joscha Feth shares his approach on visual regression testing to instill confidence in every product update. Visual Regression Testing (VRT) can be quite a polarizing activity for the developer community - it’s one of those things that can either make a developer’s eyes sparkle with joy, or darken with rage. Which side of the fence you fall on often depends on how the process of updating the visual baseline and reviewing changes works in your company. To explain what the baseline update is in simple terms – when, for example, you change the color of a button on a webpage from red to blue, every other developer who works on that page after you has to compare their changes against the blue button. Whilst you are working to change the button from red to blue however, that button on your baseline remains red. Only when you have merged your work back into the mainline does everyone’s baseline for the button become blue. The newly generated images (the ones now containing the blue button) are stored centrally and will be the new point of reference for any developer subsequently working on the project. At most companies that I’ve worked with previously, these baseline regenerations happen on the developer’s machine. Because no two developer machines are the same, when it comes to something very intricate such as generating images for a website, it is very easy to produce a slightly different result every time a new change is introduced. This difference isn’t necessarily visible to the human eye, but potentially visibly different to a computer. For example, there may be a few subpixels rounded differently in a new browser version, and thus the whole image is slightly shifted by one pixel – something which a computer would instantly understand as a difference, but would be undetectable in a superficial inspection by human eyes. Because of this tooling problem, it’s often impossible to know when there are real anomalies, as the noise caused by different tooling can be quite severe. The noise might disappear temporarily when you create a new baseline for yourself, but then shortly afterwards a colleague will say that they can see differences, because their machine will create a different image to yours — and the whole frustrating cycle begins again. This unexpected workload can be very aggravating for a developer who is working on multiple amendments to the source code, and has to keep constantly going back to make further changes to a UI that they hadn’t even realized they’d adversely impacted - not to mention the additional effort of keeping tooling in sync. This is why the automation of visual regression testing without using massive local tooling is a godsend for developers, as it eliminates the need for unreliable and time consuming manual testing, as well as having to maintain a possibly unreliable custom stack. There are currently only a few commercially available visual regression testing tools, as the market is still fairly new. Of the 3 main commercial service offerings that were available when we looked to implement VRT at Canva, we opted for a tool called Percy. For a design-centric business such as Canva, Percy is a very valuable tool, which allows us to speed up testing and catch even the small unintended visual changes that are sometimes created as side-effects of code changes. Canva has a very strong culture of peer reviewing code changes before they go into the mainline, and whilst it is often possible to reason about how code changes affect the system, it can be a time consuming riddle to reason through everything thoroughly. VRT helps us to speed up code reviews as well, as you can see from a real conversation in a pull request that I came across the other week: As visual regression testing is yet to be widely adopted, a lot of companies have their own makeshift systems that work for better or for worse. Some companies have been doing it for a few years but the in-house tools they use are commonly very clunky and/or expensive to maintain. When you join a company and they have a visual regression suite, it is usually something that they have written themselves, requires a lot of attention and maintenance, and in the end doesn’t work very well after all. This is because there has been no clearly defined process to update and regenerate baselines. Up until the last couple of years, when commercially available VRT tools have become available as services, visual regression testing involved setting up a myriad of tools on your local machine, running those tools to generate the baseline, and whilst doing so, crossing your fingers and hoping the visual differences generated are only due to the changes made, and not because one of the dependencies to render these images has changed. It may sound pretty straightforward, but keeping these dependencies stable can be complicated, as screen resolutions, browsers, libraries and machine types change. At Canva, we provide users with templates for a wide range of design projects, from online ads, flyers and logos, to posters, brochures, invitations, business cards, and much more. Whilst we already had visual regression testing for our exported designs, that particular system uses a well-defined rendering engine and is much easier to tame than common frontend and browser-based visual regression testing, so we decided to not reuse it for the web-development workflow. Percy, the service we are now using, comes with an API that will in fact allow us to replace our custom export regression testsuite with a Percy-managed project where we provide the baseline images coming from our export renderer, still retaining full control of the rendering but leveraging Percy’s service integration with GitHub, baseline approval, diffing and more, which will greatly improve that part of our testing infrastructure. Because commercially available visual regression tools are a recent phenomenon, companies have been forced to produce their own out of necessity. Percy is one of the first companies that has developed this technology and made it commercially available and fully supported, removing the headache of the ongoing maintenance of in-house solutions. Percy was a service that I had wanted to try for a long time, but in its early days it was tightly coupled to the software development platform GitHub, so I wasn’t able to use it, as the company I worked for previously had its own proprietary software development platform that was in direct competition to GitHub and not compatible with Percy. After joining Canva (which uses GitHub), I knew the time was right. After a few weeks of trialling we knew that with the Percy workflow we could vastly improve testing by preventing unwanted visual regressions, without having to maintain a custom solution. Percy solved the visual baseline update and stability issues, and also provided a number of predefined workflows and integrations with services and tools we use. There are only a few other commercially available products on the market aside from Percy, and one of these is owned and operated by one person. A company like Canva, which has over a hundred developers, could not seriously consider investing in a product from a company that only has 1 developer – if that company suddenly closed down or that person could no longer provide the support that we need, it would mean we had put a lot of effort into incorporating a product that is not supported any more and we would have to start again from scratch with another provider. With a product like Percy however, which is supported by a bigger team of developers, that risk factor is greatly reduced. Visual regression testing tools are really not something that companies want to own either, due to the fact that so much effort is required for their ongoing maintenance. Automated VRT tools seem easy enough to create at the outset, but it’s the maintenance of these tools that is onerous, not to mention potentially very costly. Commercially available tools such as Percy remove that burden. Also, once a company develops its own tool, it inherits all the traits that are specific to that particular company and has features that are specific to the types of problems that company is typically trying to solve. This makes them very difficult to migrate away from, whereas something like Percy can be used for a whole range of visual regression testing requirements, and is therefore a lot more versatile and user-friendly. In the beginning, we set up Percy for our main app page, so on every master build Percy would produce a new baseline reference that the rest of the organisation could compare against in their feature branches. Percy does have the ability to change the page state, but it means using custom APIs to do so. As we had already decided on a few other technologies to mutate browser state and decouple UI states from each other, we were a bit reluctant to add this complexity on top, hence we started looking at how we could do visual regression testing for our UI library, which is decomposed in a product called Storybook. We managed to produce a proof-of-concept that worked, but was bound by runtime (we had hundreds of different stories already at that point in time, and we build them both for left-to-right and right-to-left text direction). Together with the Percy team, we were able to improve on that, essentially making it possible to produce hundreds of snapshots in a few seconds and render them immediately. That’s when things really kicked off. Suddenly, all of our frontend developers were able to immediately spot (both wanted and unwanted) visual changes in their pull requests. Status checks on pull requests help to identify differences that will be made to the baseline. This prevents unwanted changes (tests with diffs show up as failed statuses before they are approved) and highlights intended changes once the diff has been approved. When we set out to create new components, often it’s designers, not developers who are approving baseline updates—making sure that the components they drafted in Sketch are actually represented faithfully in the frontend implementation. Separate components within a website (picture Facebook for example, with shortcuts on the left, the newsfeed in the middle and ads on the right) can be developed in isolation then combined. This separation allows you to ensure that changes made in one component of the site don’t affect all of the other components. Each of these components usually has one or more visual “stories” attached, so if, for example, you changed the colour of a button on the page from red to green, then only the button “story” which would change is its color, not the logo story or the header story. From a developer’s point of view, it can sometimes be very difficult to understand the side-effects of your code changes, particularly with user interface changes and complex code. A developer may think that a change they’ve made is really small and contained, but then when the regression test is run, it can show a knock-on effect on a whole bunch of other components that you didn’t expect to be affected. The ability to develop components in isolation gives developers added certainty that their changes are contained to just the parts that they want to effect. I remember one time where some CSS for a lightbox/dialog was introduced that conditionally added a margin to the surrounding element. Whilst this was anticipated in the context where it was introduced, the newly introduced code didn’t take all scenarios into account where the dialog was used and also didn’t clean up after itself when destroyed. Unfortunately the code was merged into the mainline nonetheless, and for reasons I don’t remember not all tests had been run. A few hours later people started seeing the diff clearly visible in hundreds of stories and we were able to track down the offending code before the change was ever shipped to our customers. For reviewers, it’s often much easier to look at changes in an automated visual regression test, rather than the person who made the changes having to verbalise the changes they made or explain them in an email or text message. This can also drastically reduce the review time. Automated VRT also takes into account the slightly different views generated by different browsers. One of the most difficult aspects of web development, especially when it comes to smaller viewing formats such as mobile browsers, is that some design aspects are very difficult to standardize across different browsers. Most of our developers use Google Chrome, a handful use Firefox and maybe one or two Safari, but none of our developers are currently using Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge. With VRT, you can run tests in two web browsers simultaneously, so we can pick up any anomalies between the developer’s browser and another common browser on the spot. It is essential that all of our components look the same in all of the browsers we support, and VRT enables us to do that (Caveat: Percy currently only supports Firefox and Chrome, with more browsers to come). Percy has become part of our standard frontend developer workflow. We currently have around 600 different stories for UI components that we perform visual regression testing on and each app contains between one and ten different screens. All of these are also run in a second text direction and many in additional screen widths based on mobile breakpoints defined by our designers, bringing our snapshot count to well over a thousand. Definitely not something that is still possible to do manually in a reasonable timeframe! For our apps, we typically use the first screen as a sanity check across browsers (we test visreg on these screens in Firefox and Chrome), then for some language specific pages, we use German to test how text length affects the UI. German is usually a good indicator of capacity, as German sentences are on average around 20% longer than any other language, and secondly, because individual words themselves can be much longer- (Donau­dampf­schiffahrts­elektrizitäten­haupt­betriebs­werk­bau­unter­beamten­gesellschaft is one rather extreme example of the way German chains nouns together, roughly translating to as “Association for Subordinate Officials of the Main Maintenance Building of the Danube Steam Shipping Electrical Services.”) Of course, it is highly unlikely that we would ever use this particular word, but you’d be surprised how many UI components fail on words like these in visual regression testing when unit tests and integration tests still pass. Testing the introduction of a new button in German We use Thai and Burmese to test text height (as they have a lot of characters with ascenders and descenders, so text is easily cut-off if developers use a fixed line-height), and Arabic as a proxy for all right-to-left languages. We also use English in both LTR and RTL as a proxy, because it is easy to reason about for engineers and provides good feedback: Testing right-to-left layouts VRT tools such as Percy can test in right-to-left text direction as well as left-to-right, so for languages that read right to left, such as Arabic, the testing is carried out automatically. This means we can be confident that the reversed text direction will have the expected effect on component layout and text in an app. Previously, we may have ended up delivering something to the end user that didn’t look exactly as we wanted or intended it to, whereas with automated VRT, we now have the surety and security of not sending anything out that contains a visual error. We’re informed by the automated testing any time something is broken and needs to be fixed prior to that going out to the customer, rather than being hostage to human error in testing. Automated VRT also ensures that developers have a much easier time of identifying and accepting or rejecting changes to the baseline code. Previously we would have to wait until users came back to us and said “this is broken, can you fix it for us?”, which is clearly less than ideal. Now we have the tools in place to prevent these incidents occurring in the first place. Tweaking the padding on a page Because our testing is now automated, it can also scale with our business. As we add more developers to our team, it can perform all the testing we require with little additional effort on our part, which is essential for the future viability of the tool and our organization as a whole. A side benefit of using a platform like Percy, where adding additional regression tests has little cost in terms of developer time, is that whole new categories of tests may become feasible. The additional tests we have developed are somewhat domain-specific to Canva, but I assume that each organization has a loosely related set of tests where they could leverage VRT to make things easier. Let me show you 4 examples: The tests I am talking about are, at their core, mathematical problems (transformations, packing, dynamic alignment) and their conditions can be mathematically expressed. However the result of that math is quite abstract and hard to understand when written down. In Canva’s case the solution to these mathematical problems can have an actual visual representation attached, something which can’t easily be expressed as part of a unit test whilst at the same time being easily updatable. Since adopting Percy we’ve started using VRT to detect regressions on these groups of problems (in the examples you can see a dynamic pie chart generation with labels, image rotation based on EXIF data in the browser, a dynamic endlessly scrolling masonry layout component and image clipping and filtering via paths and all permutations filters and clipping in between). We’ve noticed that VRT is not only much more manageable in terms of expressing fixtures for these tests and updating them, but also that detecting intended and accidental changes has become a lot easier ever since. Visual regression testing has been a great asset to Canva in the last year and a half or so. It consistently delivers value to our designers and developers, especially our many new starters who may be unsure about how changes they make can affect the system as a whole. Canva is a very visual product, which probably benefits more from VRT than most other companies, but even just considering our core UI components in Storybook, we’re getting great value for money out of Percy. The cost of maintaining the integration with Percy is marginal and Percy’s response time to incidents and their support is outstanding. It will definitely help us to scale the company successfully into the future and - as our CEO Melanie Perkins likes to put it - build the rest of the 99% of Canva that is yet to be built. The more surety we have in the end product we deliver to users, the more confident we can be in adding new features and bringing on the new developers that we need to take Canva to the next level. So if you’re standing at the crossroads deciding whether to go down the path of VRT, I would suggest finding answers to the following questions: If you can answer any of the questions above with a yes and you are not too concerned about throwing a bit of money at the problem to solve it, an automated VRT solution might be for you!

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Mission possible: how Canva engineering works across borders", "author": ["\nBen Sebastian\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/engineering-across-borders/", "abstract": "Frontend engineer Ben Sebastian shares how we streamline work despite having the team spread across different continents, and how he is able to contribute to a product used worldwide – right from his office seat in Canva Manila. My last 3 jobs were all in the Manila offices of multinational companies. This often meant video calls with colleagues overseas in place of face-to-face conversations, chat messages instead of tapping a teammate on the shoulder, and announcements being relayed through emails. With cross-country communication and virtual correspondence, things can easily go wrong – unstable internet connections, misinterpretation of messages, and the difficulty of finding a common time where everyone is free for calls, among others. What I knew of cross-country collaboration, however, was challenged when I started working in Canva. I was pleasantly surprised by how a company with a team spread across different continents is able to foster an environment of seamless cooperation, and maintain a consistent experience across its locations. In this blog, I’ll share how we work hand-in-hand with other engineers based oceans apart - and why it’s not where you work from, but how you work that makes all the difference. As I’ve found, it comes down to two factors - investing in communication , but also fostering autonomy . Manila and Sydney-based frontend engineers catch up In a normal remote work setting, there’s just not enough of a personal relationship with colleagues overseas. One of my previous jobs was in the marketing department of a mobile communications company, and our engineers were all in Korea. However, I was the one generating reports and analyzing the data for our product, remotely from the Philippines. It was very difficult to communicate, and I didn’t really know who the engineers were - I’d never seen them before! Because I had no idea of their personality, I didn’t know how to approach them. I didn’t see them for four years until I was finally sent to Korea for a convention. It became a lot easier to talk to them after that experience, and we were able to work together more effectively. On the flip side, Canva understands the benefits of personal connection. Manila-based engineers fly to Sydney once a year (or more if necessary) to undergo training, align with other project stakeholders, and get face time with the people whom we work with but usually only get to interact with virtually. While we chat everyday, there is a different rapport formed when we’re together in person. I’ve learned here that getting to know people on a personal level allows me to rally the team and get our best work done. While it’s easy to schedule regular video calls to align, it’s also easy to get sidetracked with stories, comments, and unrelated conversations during meetings. One thing I learned from my colleagues at Canva is the deliberate effort to maximize time. For me, this stems from the sense of ownership and accountability that each person has with their projects. This means that time in calls and meetings are spent efficiently, and there is an unspoken rule against dilly-dallying. This doesn’t mean that we’re not friendly - on the contrary, I’d like to believe I’ve built very strong personal relationships here. It’s just that we acknowledge that there is a time for work and a time for play. Everyone invests a lot of effort into communication. In terms of engineering communication, ‘Take the time to teach each other’ is one of our core engineering values , so the need to invest in communication between engineers is recognized at a whole team level. That goes even for small things, like responding to messages as soon as possible. Another example - in some companies, HR can be very difficult to approach, but at Canva our Team Happiness colleagues are one of the friendliest and easiest teams to reach out to in the whole company. I find it impressive how communicating has gotten so easy here, so much so that Slack chats and Google Meet calls with my Sydney counterparts feel like a tap on their shoulder or a slight nudge. Because of the efficient use of time, it almost seems like they’re seated at the desk across me, and we can meet, discuss, and clarify things more quickly than I would think. Recently for example, there was an issue that came up which required me to communicate with colleagues across 3 different continents all at the same time. Because of everyone’s make-it-happen mindset, we were able to solve the issue that same day. Celebrating my birthday with the team Communication doesn’t happen on its own. Unless people are already in the same room, someone needs to set up the video conference, arrange the room, organize the meeting and book flights for the big Season Opener event in Sydney or Manila. That’s where Canva’s Vibe Team and Team Happiness come in, doing the legwork so communication and collaboration can happen seamlessly, whether it’s between floors or between countries. In so many ways, we are provided with what we need to do our best work. As I mentioned earlier, this includes access to great tools. Our office, located at the heart of Makati City, has an open-space setup so we can work and collaborate in an environment that suits us best. This means we can work in our well-lit pantry, right next to the coffee machine and snacks table, or our own standing desks next to our teammates, or in a quiet room all to ourselves. Snacks at Canva Manila What has autonomy got to do with working across offices? Autonomy is like the flip side of communication - communication helps you get things done together, while autonomy lowers the communication overhead and empowers individuals and small teams to get things done, regardless of how many offices and employees there are. There are a number of ways that Canva empowers its teams and engineers to work autonomously, including: Unleashing the inner tiger with my Digital Design teammates Autumn Season Opener at the Manila office The company is at hyper growth, but effective coordination and high-quality conversations are being preserved - if not enhanced - as we expand. As teams get larger, we’re split into squads that allow us to be more hands-on with projects, and consequently, contribute to the product with more impact. These squads also allow us to know who the stakeholders of the project are, therefore giving us direct access to them, and encouraging us to have direct and confident input into the direction of a project. In her blog entry on ‘Working with global teams’, Canva Product Manager Georgia Vidler talked about maintaining a minimum viable structure within these teams and squads, and how they help us get things done as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Multi-disciplinary squads, including a PM, designer, frontend and backend engineers To be honest, when I was new here, I thought I would just be coding a bunch of landing pages. But as we started assessing the performance of our pages, seeing the impact it has on our design community, and gaining more understanding of why we do what we do, there was a deeper sense of purpose with each page and each project. The Color wiki, in particular, was one of my most challenging projects to date. Programmatically working with colors was tough, but I am proud to have seen that through and how it came out, and am happy with the great feedback it received. The thought that a professor used it to come up with a social media graphic , a digital marketing professional learned about his brand colors , and a learning designer got color ideas for her presentation fuel me with the thought that a project I worked on got to help someone in one way or another. The Color and Sizes wikis, and the Support , Print , and Learn pages are not just tasks I had to accomplish. They are pages I helped build that is now empowering people from all over the globe. Regardless of which office I’m working from - I know that what I’m doing matters. The mindset we have at Canva is not that we’re doing things for someone, and working just for the sake of it. Each engineer is autonomous, so when I merge to master, I can say that this is my work, my contribution. There is ownership, confidence, and the thought that what I’m doing today contributes to something unimaginably bigger. This means that every squad and individual is empowered and encouraged to do what needs to be done, even when projects are coordinated between teams and countries. Portrait exhibition of Canva employees Having autonomy as a team also means having the right tools to do your work, and the right people when you need them. One of the things I appreciate most about Canva is that we’re given access to the resources we need, from new programs to new hires when necessary. For my squad in the Digital Design team, this includes being able to access and test out a multitude of tools like Yoast Premium, Advanced Custom Fields Pro and Gravity Forms Pro. Access to these make me feel like a child at a toy store. I value that there is a great degree of trust given to each of us in determining what contributes to our productivity and effectiveness, and this is something I always want to live up to. But it’s not just the tools to do your core job, it’s also the tools to track how you’re doing at that job. When I first started we were growing quickly, but as an engineer I didn’t have much insight into our metrics, like how pages were performing. Now, it’s very different. We have many channels to access analytics, experiments, and all kinds of tools to track how we’re doing. We’re not just on our computers, typing code, we’re actually assessing the performance of our code. That’s made a huge difference to autonomy and ownership - if you can see the scoreboard, you’re empowered to make adjustments in real time. Fortunately and/or unfortunately, the industry I’m in is ever-changing. Even if I were to spend years perfecting theories and memorizing languages, I still wouldn’t be considered an expert in my field. At Canva, there is a genuine understanding of the concept of continuous learning, and the acknowledgement that development practices evolve over time. Languages, environments, structures, and processes change, and it is essential to keep up. What does this have to do with collaboration and autonomy? Of course to collaborate effectively as an engineer you need the technical skills, and the skills needed are always changing, especially with a fast-growing product. But beyond that, if engineers aren’t empowered to grow and learn new skills, we’ll always have to rely on other people who already have those skills, making our teams slower and less flexible. For instance, I was first brought in as a Wordpress Developer, but was eventually given a project in Ruby on Rails. There was naturally fear and nervousness in learning a new framework, but I couldn’t feel luckier to be given the opportunity to expand my skill and receive mentorship from my fellow engineers. Learning here, I noticed, comprised of the perfect mix of being taught and being given the freedom to learn myself. If I had questions, I will be pointed at the right direction of people who could help me. As our Head of Engineering Joel Hynoski mentioned in a recent blog entry , “We want our people to be able to continuously learn— the company is always growing, and as such we want our people to be able to grow with it.” Our engineer count is now at a whopping number of 120+, and that number goes up by the day. Slack channels have been created for languages we want to explore , and there are after-work meetings for knowledge sharing. There is indeed a wealth of knowledge available when there are over a hundred brains to pick. We are also given an annual professional education allowance for skills-based training courses, seminars, as well as books, journal subscriptions, and magazines. As the solid code base of our product is ensured, engineers are also enabled to stay at the top of our game. Canva’s tagline, empowering the world to design anything and publish anywhere , may sound ambitious, but it’s happening in real time. Social media posts and real-life stories told by friends or shared by colleagues help me realize that magic is happening. The product we’re working on is helping job applicants get noticed because of resume templates, students get their work done easily and quickly because of its ease of use, NGOs get to easily design and publish social media content because of our non-profit program, and many more. As an engineer, I feel that I really understand the goals and the product itself, and what the product can serve to the users. In a way, this understanding is the secret ingredient of collaboration. We own the product, which means that we’re motivated to make communication efficient, invest in communicating and connecting with the team, and working autonomously to make our part happen. Add to that the right tools and the right support, and collaboration between offices doesn’t seem so daunting any more. I don’t need to move elsewhere to change the world. I’m contributing to a product used by over 10 million people, and I can do my fair share of empowering the world from right here in Manila.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Copy that means business: how Canva aligns content with business metrics", "author": ["\nAmelia Marshall\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/copy-that-means-business/", "abstract": "We’ve all heard it before—content is king, especially when it comes to growing your business. But how do you ensure the content you put out there will actually achieve your goals? In this blog post, Canva’s resident content expert Amelia Marshall shares how we use the power of words to grow our user base, and reveals her tips on how to create content that is not only engaging and valuable, but also holds up against your business metrics. Human beings love a good story. It’s hardwired into our brains —since the days when cavemen gathered around the campfire, stories have been a way to teach, learn, and connect with others. Fast-forward to the 21st century, and stories are everywhere, from ad campaigns to selfie captions. And storytelling’s cousin, content , is particularly prevalent : the average person now consumes about 34 gigabytes worth of information every day, or some 100,000 words worth of information. So what is “content”? Content covers everything from blog posts to videos. To paraphrase Nora Ephron, everything is content. And content marketing is exactly what it sounds like—using content to promote your business to potential customers. But here’s the thing: nobody wants to read content marketing. Research shows that millennials no longer respond to ads —and if your content sounds like an ad, they’ll know it. But a well-told story still cuts through. It’s no secret that Canva is focused on growth—our mission is to empower the world to design, and by that we mean the whole world. And content has been a crucial part of our growth to date: from landing pages that bring in new users, to blog posts that garner thousands of shares and boost our domain authority. In this blog, I’ll share our approach into using content to move the needle for Canva, starting with: First, a note on voice. Canva’s content strategy covers everything from emails to ads and blog posts. Across every platform, we aim to speak with one voice. The Canva voice is friendly, empowering, inspiring and visual. You can draw a direct line from Canva’s mission and values, to Canva’s voice. “Be a good human” and “Make complex things simple” are two of our key company values, and they’re a crucial part of how we talk to our users, too. When we pulled together Canva’s Voice and Tone guide, it was these values that we kept returning to. For any business looking to create a content marketing strategy, establishing how you want to sound is just as important as figuring out what you want to say. There are plenty of ways to measure the success of a content marketing strategy – after all, that’s what this article is about. But as Maya Angelou said, “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” And if you’re converting a large number of visitors to your site, but you’re giving them the wrong impression about who you are as a brand, then you’re doing your business no favors. Days, weeks and months after a potential user has clicked away from your site, they’re left with an impression of who you are as a brand. That’s the far-reaching legacy of your brand’s voice. The number one thing to remember when you’re creating content online is that it’s not about you. Sure, you might be creating it to sell your product, promote your business, or because you think you’re ‘supposed’ to. But these priorities need to be put aside when planning and writing content; your content needs to be in service of its audience. Content that means business has to have one foot in both camps. Now, I may not be a data scientist, but I like a graph as much as the next person who works in tech – so here’s a Venn diagram demonstrating the content marketing sweet spot. So how do you decide what to write about? With user research. By finding out what your target user (or customer) is interested in, you can create an endless treasure trove of content inspiration. For Canva, a lot of our content is tied to retention – so it’s aimed at our current user base. This means we can look at all of the information we have about our users, and find ideas for our next story. For example, we know from our most-used design types that a lot of our users are creating marketing material. So we have a wide range of articles that bring value to these users by teaching them about marketing. It’s never sell-sell-sell. Instead, it’s about lending insights. In her book Badass: Making Users Awesome , Kathy Sierra talks about the product, and the context around the product. For Canva, that context is design – and it’s a fertile ground for content marketing. And it’s also tied to the other plank of Canva’s content strategy, which is product education. Product education helps users realize the full potential of Canva. Canva also creates content to attract new users. With this in mind, we research topics where people have a high amount of ‘intent’ – for us, that’s people searching for information related to design. We’ve shared our strategy for growing our audience in the past, and the approach remains fool-proof: identify the content that your audience is interested in, find the market gap, and create high-quality content. Take one of our highest-converting articles in 2018 as an example: Here’s what your resume should look like in 2018 . It answers a burning question in the mind of the Googler, providing them with expert perspectives and actionable tips. Yes, we want users to try our resume templates, but we also want them to feel like they’ve learned something useful. It’s no wonder that so many readers decide to click through and try a Canva template. How did we come up with this particular post on resumes? Well, first we looked at user research – in this case, the document types that are most likely to bring in new users. I looked at user data tracking the most commonly made designs in Canva, then looked specifically at new users. Resumes turned out to be a popular design type for this cohort. Next, we looked at the kinds of questions people ask about resumes using SEO keyword research. I started by using a handy (and free!) tool called Answer The Public , which reveals the kinds of questions people ask about a particular keyword. For resumes, questions like “what resume should look like”, “what resume template is most successful” and “what resume format should I use” dominated the results. Keyword research showing the kinds of questions people ask about resumes From this research, it was clear that we could offer some valuable insights on this topic. Finally, we wrote the post, and peppered it with CTAs that bring new users on board – every template displayed is a call to action. Some 15% of visitors to this post sign up or create a design in Canva. But how do we know if this content is any good? Every article, email, and push notification we write features a call to action. That means that no piece of content is an end in and of itself. It has to be a stepping stone to some sort of business goal: say, acquiring more users, or upgrading them to Canva for Work . This means that every piece of content features a call to action. At Canva, all of our marketing is done within the Growth Marketing team. This means that we have to uphold the principles of growth marketing: measuring results and using 10X thinking. So it’s crucial that these calls to action drive results. We test every piece of content we create. If it’s a blog post, we track how much traffic it receives; but this is but no means a fait accompli. From there, we measure how much of that traffic leads to conversions. The next step is optimization. This is where the real magic happens. You look at the data and you ask: how could I improve this? For posts that under-perform in terms of traffic, we might look for longtail SEO keywords that we can expand upon in the article, to bring in more organic visitors. Then we add to the original article. For posts that have a low percentage of conversions, we’ll tweak the wording of the CTA. The options are endless, which is part of the fun: you can never stop optimizing. One of my first projects at Canva was re-writing the Canva for Work landing page. The original version had been around since the product’s launch in 2015. The most prominent tag-line on the page read “Easily create beautiful documents and designs. Use Canva’s drag-and-drop editor to design stunning graphics.” While this is absolutely a selling point, it’s ultimately a selling point for the free version of Canva. So why pay for the premium product? To optimize this page, I looked at user reviews of Canva for Work, and discovered what it was that people rave about. This process is pretty scrappy and straightforward: we read reviews of Canva on sites like Capterra, and look for the phrases that people use again and again. With Canva for Work, people constantly mentioned how it makes them look professional. So that became the new tag line: Design made professional. Coupled with a design overhaul, the new landing page nearly doubled conversions overnight. The original Canva for Work landing page The updated Canva for Work landing page, featuring a design and copy overhaul Iteration is the second prong of this strategy. If you’ve had some success with an article, or a landing page strategy, a hundred more opportunities are unlocked. Say you’re writing for a wellness blog, and your article “7 great smoothie bowls to try this week” has really taken off. There are a number of hypotheses you can test based on this article’s success. Maybe your readers really like listicles – so you could try “10 brilliant supplements you haven’t heard of” . Perhaps smoothie bowls are having a moment – so why not try “9 smoothie bowl flavors you’ll love” ? Or it could be the weekly meal guide format that really connects with your audience, so try “7 healthy weeknight meals made in 20 minutes” . One way we do this at Canva is by revising content that’s performed well in the past. For example, the world of social media is a fast-moving one, so while our 2016 article See how these companies win on Instagram — and learn how you can do the same without a professional designer still brings in traffic, there are new trends and insights that are much more relevant. So, we spoke to branding and design experts and created a new version of the post filled with current insights – 12 brands that are killing it on Instagram . This post now brings in 20x the traffic of its predecessor.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "The culture myth", "author": ["\nZach Kitschke\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/the-culture-myth/", "abstract": "In this blog, Zach Kitschke , Head of People at Canva, explains why you shouldn’t try to copy and paste culture that you see elsewhere. Instead, the key to creating a great culture is focusing your efforts on building a “People System” based on strong values. There’s always the inevitable awkwardness when someone asks me what I do for work. As I often explain, it’s a bit of everything! Our People team have a very broad remit here at Canva — we’re responsible for every part of the team’s success: hiring great people, building and supporting teams, helping everyone grow and develop, evangelizing our culture and product, and creating a workplace everyone loves coming to every day. As we’ve grown, we’ve had a bit more interest in how we do things. I often find myself showing people around Canva, as they’re interested in learning how we’ve scaled. When I tell people that our whole team has lunch together every day, I often get this blank stare, then a laugh. “Are you serious?” they say. Then they see a rock climbing wall. And a coaching room… Often they then say “oh we should copy this idea,” and jump to how it could work for their company or organisation. Fair enough, I do the same. I see a company with a great culture, and start to cherry pick the things they’ve done. But every company is different. The founders are different. The DNA isn’t the same. You can transplant some great idea you’ve had, but the organization is likely to reject it if it isn’t aligned with your values. Building a winning culture really requires understanding what type of company you want to build, and tailoring everything back to that. We’re not and will never be a Blackwater Capital, a Google, or a Bain & Co. We’re Canva, and we want to own that. So many people focus on how to create a great “culture” — they’re usually striving for more innovation, a more empowered team, or to be a better workplace for millenials. But you can’t copy and paste culture — it’s an artefact of how and why you do what you do. It’s the result of how you do things, and the million decisions made by your team each day. The starting point for creating culture is your values. But values have to be lived to mean anything. For us, even when we had 5 people, we made decisions in a certain way: As we grew we needed a better way to articulate this innate “operating system” that we all intuitively understood, and so we put these into words — resulting in our 6 values: So if the starting point is values, what comes next? The way I think about it: when you design a product like Canva, you are creating a closed system where all the pieces work together. We recently rolled out a Design System for Canva, that systemises and bakes in lots of decisions: It’s the same for a company. There’s an innate values system — and operating model — that our People team spends a lot of time unpacking and building upon. Earlier this year, we set out to refine our mission as a People team and settled on: Build the most effective and engaged company in the world. For me, the two things are inseparable: we wanted to be the “best” company in the world, which comes back to all of us having a massive impact with everything we do, constantly building amazingly effective teams, helping each other to grow, and creating a great working environment that helps everyone succeed. So, how do we do that on a practical basis, in a way that aligns with our “People Operating System”? Here are some examples of how we guide decisions for our People team, and the impacts on our culture: A few years ago, our team had expanded, and what used to be a highly effective group — in tune with another and able to move fast — started to slow down. There was too many people doing too many things and we needed to divide our attention. So, we started to untangle how we could each best contribute to the mission — setting out a series of goals that various “teams” could rally towards: All our goals from January 2016, including the goal to “Launch in Spanish” — we’re now in 100+ languages and used in every country in the world As we grew, we doubled down on the idea of team as mini startup. In fact, we even got our teams to develop a pitch and present to our awesome investors over at Blackbird. We realized the format was really powerful, and not long afterwards, we launched our “Season Opener” — a far more interesting alternative to a quarterly planning conference. Now, we do this at the start of every season. Every part of the company gets a chance to present what they’ve achieved in the past three months, and share what their next big goal is. We also use it to celebrate what makes Canva unique. Our last season opener had a Spring fair theme, with circus performers, song-and-dance, and fortune tellers all helping each team share their wins: A highlights reel from our recent Spring Season Opener Another principle we’ve adopted as we’ve scaled is that all our teams and individuals at Canva should be accountable and have ownership over their work. We all own our own success. We introduced the Health Check as a way for teams to self-diagnose any potential challenges that stand in the way of being as effective as possible, and formulate their own action plan. Run once a season, these health checks often result in actions like: An individual’s journey through a company mirrors that of someone using a product. Say you sign up to Canva on the recommendation of a friend. You probably sign up knowing a little, but once you log into the platform, you’d find yourself experimenting with different applications. You experience a “newbie high”, where you feel exhilarated when you create something that looks cool. Then you start to want to do more and more, and realize you have a skills gap. You can’t get the desired look you set out to achieve. That’s when you start receiving trigger emails chock full of content to guide you — tutorials about design, feature prompts to show you how to add text, color guides, suggestions on how to download your design in different formats. If we take that same analogy and apply it to someone who joins our team, we find a lot of similarities to the user experience - in this case, the newbie experience. There’s a fine balance — it’s about riding the edge of the wave without falling off. In actual fact, we mapped this emotional journey out for our team and identified a pattern: Focussing on the first 3 months, we realized there were two areas we needed to work on to ensure we counteracted the natural “lows” in the journey for our newbies: Our Canva mentor mentee relationship How does this look? Not only do we have an in-person bootcamp for both our mentors and our new hires, we’re also experimenting with things like an email drip for mentors. Here’s an example of what they receive: There’s a lot of times when you’re catching a new “wave” and need some help to navigate the ups and downs: Each of these different “user” journeys should trigger training, support and clarity of expectations so you can succeed. As we’ve scaled, people have asked “what can I do to grow?” This has become a greater need as we’ve scaled to 350+ people and beyond. In 2016, we anonymized the data and aggregated all the feedback from a 360 degree review (where every member of the team requested feedback from those they worked most closely with), and identified “4 towers”, that related to people’s success, or their opportunities to grow. More recently we picked this up again, as teams were starting to build out their own skills maps. We realized, after trying to simplify this as much as possible, that the same things that help an Engineer to be successful also help our People or Customer Happiness teams to be successful too. So recently we launched our very own Canva Journey, which is designed to be a forward-looking map that anyone on the team can use to identify areas to grow. There are a few important principles we’ve baked in: We’ve also launched a series of workshops, based on the experiences of people who excel at a particular skill, so everyone can learn from them what excellence looks like and how to mirror their success in practice. One of our most successful initiatives as a People team hasn’t even been run by us. Realizing that people were organizing their own social events and activities within their own teams, and recognizing we couldn’t organize everything ourselves, we decided to let anyone start their own “Canva Club” and receive $200 per month in funding, as long as they had more than 10 members and had met 4+ times. We now have a club for almost everything, all run by people with a particular passion. You just have to scroll through our Slack channels to see: Board games club at Canva Aspiring to a great culture is something we all do, but it’s important to know what your company stands for. We don’t all have to be the same, and different cultures work for different companies. The key thing is to have a clear sense of what matters to you, and the rest follows. We’re a few years into our journey here at Canva, and are really just getting started. There’ll be lots of new challenges to solve in the coming years, but something I hope we’ll always come back to is finding the best way to scale that fits our values.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Our tried and tested way to scale design with systems", "author": ["\nIain Dowling\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/scaling-design-with-systems/", "abstract": "One of the great benefits of Canva is the ability to publish your design in many different ways, from printing to Pinterest. On our Product Design team, we call these “publish endpoints” - the potentially limitless ways to take your design from the Canva editor out into the world. As the demand for more publish endpoints continues to grow, Canva product designer Iain Dowling shares how we use a systems-first approach to tackle design challenges in product delivery. Canva iOS team discussing product A fundamental principle of Canva is that, within the one platform, you should be able to create a design and then, with a single click, publish anywhere. Whilst our design tool is well developed, it’s always been important to keep iterating our product to give our community access to a variety of new publishing options. We started off by handcrafting each new publish option, but we soon saw that this approach wouldn’t scale. It soon became quite apparent to us that we needed a systems-first approach to avoid any design bottleneck. In this blog, I’ll share how we leveraged these systems in order to accelerate product delivery - starting from launching our visual design system, to communicating through a task flow diagram system, and then bringing it all together with our own approach to the double diamond design system. Since our launch in 2013, Canva has grown from strength to strength, with over 10M users from all around the world. We used to be able to count our team on one hand; today we have over 350 people working across 3 offices, with a product design team of 12 and 100+ engineers working on delivering new product iterations every day. As the size of the team increased and the complexity of the product grew, inefficiencies grew alongside. For our ever growing team to remain productive, we launched a new design system earlier this year. From having no standard rules for design resulting in slightly different interfaces for the same needs: varying styles for similar buttons, clashing element layouts, and differing interaction patterns within the same flow, any design changes were incredibly hard to execute - which was a constant headache for our design team, ultimately rearing its ugly head in our user experience. It also took longer to build things, as our engineering teams were maintaining code in multiple places. From having several buttons variations across files, to consistent button components By introducing more consistency, the improvements were significant. With the foundation of a shared set of guidelines and principles, the team soon found ourselves speaking the same language regardless of what product we were working on, or where we were based - making it quicker for us to implement any changes so we can move on to bigger problems. In addition, we were able to create a consistent user experience across all platforms (web, iOS and Android), and ship new updates quickly and efficiently. Our Publish dropdown, which houses the publish endpoints for Canva designs My team are accountable for our publish endpoints, so it made sense to start with this challenge. We set out to launch a host of new publish endpoints for Canva, including Linkedin Company Profiles, Pinterest and Slack. As we planned to add more and more, it was obvious that we needed a simple way to communicate the growing feature set with the broader team of product managers, engineers and designers. To do this, we had to simplify our processes to its core essence, leveraging a task flow diagram as a communication tool for the team. Simplifying the design process by Elizabeth McKenzie In the past, every time our team identified a valuable endpoint to integrate, say for example, Twitter, it would be designed and implemented in isolation. Once complete, we would identify the next endpoint, say LinkedIn, and start the process again. As a freelance consultant in a previous life, I saw many businesses, from small to blue-chip clients, facing a similar challenge. A steady pipeline of new features would be requested, designed and implemented one at a time, giving the false benefit of short-term progress, but in turn creating burdens of duplicate designs and code cruft. The vision of an overall system and feature pattern was lost, and the wheel was reinvented each time a new feature was added. There are many problems with this kind of process, such as: Taking inspiration from the age-old manufacturing process, we looked into whether we could identify commonalities within our endpoints and design a universal ‘mold’, allowing us to rapidly ramp up production. The concept of being able to publish anywhere means different things to different people - some think online, others think hard copies. Some think anywhere in school, others, anywhere in the world. So before we started off by pulling together a list of potential endpoints to ensure we’re on the same page. We set out to prioritise the biggest areas of impact based on: Deriving insights from these sources helped reaffirm our plan to prioritize certain endpoints over others, so our decision making was effectively guided by market potential, influenced by how quickly and easily we could implement. The next step is to see if we can identify any similarities and commonalities between the endpoints. Taking social integrations as an example. Pinterest and Tumblr are two different image sharing social platforms, with different users, different languages, different styles of engagement. By identifying similarities and commonalities between the two of them, we’d find that both are social media platforms where a user manages multiple boards/blogs, meaning that the path for a user to publish a Canva design on either platform could be the same. Example: By taking the specific features of each endpoint and finding the patterns that connected them, we aimed to abstract the problem and think about the idea of an endpoint itself at a higher level - not only in terms of specific API endpoints and integrations, but in terms of user goals and patterns of interaction. Once we were able to understand the most important things users need in order to achieve their publish goal, our focus was redirected to solving a core, repeatable problem, rather than prematurely offering a solution. (Click to enlarge) This diagram describes how users publish their design to any social network or cloud storage endpoint. New endpoints are usually able to be integrated with little or no changes required. Here you can see before and after a Facebook API update. This shows how well designed systems can be easily updated to accommodate changes in third-party APIs. With this design task flow, it is now far easier to take action required by third-party API updates. For example, we were able to adapt quickly and seamlessly to Facebook’s comprehensive API and policy changes this year. The task flow is one asset, and the following mockups provide another look into our process. There are tokens for dynamic content so that one mockup is representative of all potential possibilities, rather than having a new mockup for every introduction of a new endpoint. Social is just one facet of publishing; this process translates to the analog world as well. Our Canva Print team were also able to use the same approach to create their own version of the system and other design artefacts specific to print endpoints, meaning we can now scale to include printing T-shirts, dresses, banners, or stickers one day - the potential is endless. Although it required investing more time upfront, our task flow design system has allowed us to rapidly integrate new publish endpoints. What this means for us is that in just 3 months alone, our engineers were able to implement with minimal direction - so much so that we increased our publish endpoints from 7 to 27 in rapid succession, including Tumblr graphics, Etsy shop icons and a Twitch banner. We managed to do this AND save hours of our engineers’ and designers’ time, which would have otherwise been spent on solving the same problem, over and over. So what was once a laborious affair, the team now had a single reference point to kick off the process. Hypothetically, should a new social platform come to market and prove to be very popular, we can now integrate super quickly with close to zero design requirement and a codebase that borrows from a library of shared components - a testament to the future-proofing qualities of the system. With this new design system, we now have the ability to scale quickly to reach more publish endpoints even faster than before. A commonly used system in the design process is what we know as the principle of the ‘double diamond’. Double diamond by Elizabeth McKenzie The double diamond design system is traditionally defined by 4 phases: discover, define, develop and deliver, where a number of possible ideas are created (divergent thinking) before refining and narrowing down to the best idea (convergent thinking), and then repeating the process so that the problem can be properly defined. At Canva, we follow the same methodology - albeit with a few slight iterations, in which we take an idea and pass it through several design considerations before we land on a prototype that best fits our solution. (Click to enlarge) Similar to the double diamond, our design system follows 4 distinct phases: kickoff, storyboard, prototyping & user testing, and UI & documentation Whilst every project needs a nuanced way of working, what these guidelines offer is a checklist that we can use to make sure we’re ticking off all the right points before we land on a final design. For example, when we used the task flow system during the Storyboard phase, we were able to help our engineering team visualize how much resourcing was involved, and give them the confidence that all edge cases were considered from the start, rather than becoming problems later in the process. Getting these systems in place has helped us focus our creative efforts on the problem at hand, and ensuring our team is all singing from the same song-sheet. By adopting this design system, we’re ensuring that our time is spent wisely; that we’re defining the problem that needs to be solved right from the start, and that all functionalities of the final product is considered with the end user in mind. There is a common thread throughout all of our designs systems at Canva. For us, the definition of a good system is one that is flexible and allows for its users to adapt it creatively for whatever challenge is at hand. It works best by acting as guide rails with moveable components that can be altered to help the team move forward with its goal. Having the right systems in place will not only get us there faster, but it will also help us produce the right outcome every time. The continuous challenge for us it to keep using our systems creatively to solve new problems, and always seeking for other processes that can benefit from a unified design system.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Why we’ll always be exploring new programming languages at Canva", "author": ["\nJosh Leeb-du Toit\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/exploring-new-programming-languages/", "abstract": "Our choice of programming language has the ability to change the way we view a problem and how we interact with it. Different languages provide different ways of modelling real-world scenarios, and can have a massive impact on the speed at which a product can iterate and scale. In this blog, Canva engineer Josh Leeb-du Toit explains why he’s looking into Rust, and how exploring new languages can benefit you in the long run. In the earlier days of Canva, our codebase was comprised of Java for the backend, and vanilla Javascript on the frontend. This approach worked well back then, but it would’ve been impossible to scale to the number of engineers we have now and remain productive if we hadn’t adapted. So, we introduced some changes to our tech stack. We switched out Javascript for Typescript with React, introduced Kotlin and Swift for our mobile apps, and added others for specifically selected purposes, such as Scala for our data science and machine learning team. We haven’t been afraid to make these changes and it has allowed us to scale and evolve while remaining productive. Onboarding session for new Canva engineers We’ve needed to adapt our tech stack in the past, and we may have to change parts of it again in the future. There will always be isolated problems that our current tech stack can’t solve, and blind spots in the conceptual models that our current languages offer. For all of these reasons, it’s important for us to keep exploring new languages, so we have the knowledge that will help us adapt. In this article, I’ll talk about developing a culture of exploration around new languages and technologies, and the benefits that this brings. Before anything else, it’s important to encourage everyone to adopt a culture of exploration. By exploration, we mean tinkering with ideas and concepts that may, or may not, make an impact to the company’s bottom line. By investing the time to explore new options and technologies, we are exercising diversity of thought, which may potentially reap huge rewards down the line. As well as the languages we use every day at Canva, we’re exploring many new languages on the side. There is a strong interest around Canva in many of these nascent languages and we seldom explore them in isolation. Clubs have been forming around these younger languages, like Go and Elixir. There are Slack channels for those interested in functional programming, and we have groups meeting after work to explore these languages together. Canva’s engineering culture values constant learning, and these clubs, regular frontend and backend forums, and hosted tech talks are all part of a culture of exploration and constantly improving engineering. I’ve been looking after Canva’s Rust club for a while now. It started in the first months of 2018 with only 4 people. Now we’re up to 24 on Slack and have been holding weekly sessions after work to talk and do all things Rust. Rust Club Weekly Meetup We’ve worked on a decentralized chat program, an NES emulator, and now we’re looking at embedded projects, fonts, and tooling to 10x our developer efficiency. While there are plenty of languages that we’re looking at, I’m not expecting all, if any, to be used everyday for mission critical software. Some haven’t been battle tested and others are still young and changing. But the act of exploring and knowledge sharing has some very immediate benefits, which I’ll delve into below. It can be useful to think of programming languages as tools, like a hammer or a wrench. It’s what we use to develop, maintain, and extend software programs. To continue with this analogy, if you’re about to start putting together some furniture it makes sense to have a good idea of the tools available. You don’t want to go into it only knowing one or two because when you encounter a screw… I imagine it would be quite a challenge to screw it in with a wrench. This applies to software development as well. If you need to store some data it’s necessary to know what databases are out there. With this in mind, when writing a program it’s important to do the same analysis. If your program needs to be built quickly and easily maintained then you may go with one language, and if it needs to scale super well and have an uptime of 99.99999% there might be an alternative, better choice to consider. The properties of each language will mean that it will lend itself to solving a specific class of problem. Ask any engineer and they’ll tell you that using Bash to write a web frontend is not a great idea. But on the other hand, Javascript definitely has its drawbacks when it comes to composing shell commands. At Canva, we tend to work with Java and Typescript, but that’s not the only code committed to our repos. We are writing everything from Python and PHP, to Scala and Swift. Each language is carefully selected to help us develop solutions for a specific area of the product. There’s no silver bullet. A language will never be the best at everything. There are some more general purpose languages like Java and C++, but you can be certain they have their drawbacks as well. It is important to know your programming toolbox, and by having experience with many languages you are immediately in a better position to select the best language to solve your problem. There’s another benefit to exploring new languages. The act of learning and thinking in a different way will make you a better problem solver. Programming languages are how we represent real world problems to computers. To do so we need to break down the problem into smaller pieces and then figure out how best to join them together for the computer to understand. Depending on the language and the problem, the pieces and the way they look can be very different. Let’s use the example of a car and how we could represent that in two different ways. If we want to represent the car in a language like Java we would likely break it down into its object parts: into its engine, wheels, and pedals. Then each of these would be an object and we could perform actions on them to change their data. For example, if the engine is turned on, we will record that within the engine object. Now for a language like Haskell, rather than focusing on the objects we focus on the actions. We would have an action for turning on the car, pushing in the accelerator pedal, and stepping on the brakes. Then these actions get given some data to act on and they respond with new data, such as how far the pedals are pushed in. These are two different ways of solving the same problem. If you only knew the former representation, then everything may appear to be an object. But if you only knew the latter then everything is an action. These representations go further than telling a computer what something is - they point to completely different paths for arriving at the same solution. By learning to break down problems and think of solutions in different ways, you expand your problem-solving mind. I often find myself thinking about how I would solve a problem in a completely different language, even though I’m coding in Java. And I’m certain it has made me a better problem solver. There are definitely trade offs when deciding to explore and learn a new language. It doesn’t happen overnight - in fact, it can take many weeks to progress beyond beginner level. However, at Canva it is clear the benefits are understood. Constantly exploring new languages and expanding our toolbox allows us to think about problems in new ways, and even adapt our core technology when we need to. So we’ll continue looking at new technologies and applying them to big problems and crazy new goals as we grow. For more details on our current job openings, visit Canva’s careers page here .

{"website": "Canva", "title": "The one thing every designer must consider", "author": ["\nJob Buenazedacruz\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/one-thing-every-designer-must-consider/", "abstract": "Job Buenazedacruz got her start on inclusive design with her Industrial Design thesis, the UNA Blind-friendly Toy Kitchen — a toy that can be enjoyed not just by sighted children but also by those who are blind. As one of the drivers of Canva’s accessibility projects, Job tells us how her personal and professional journey with inclusive design inspired her to incorporate the same principles at Canva. I was in university when I came up with an idea to design a toy catering to the needs of children with disabilities, who often feel left out and disadvantaged when playing with other kids. Intended for children with visual impairments, I created “UNA”, a toy kitchen set that gives the children the opportunity to express themselves through interactive components in its induction cooktop, sink and see-through fridge. By simply incorporating bump-on markers, RFID sensors and ambient sounds, the blind-friendly kitchen gives children — both blind and sighted — a fun space for role play. Throughout my research in designing this toy, I saw the world through the experiences of people with disabilities. I heard their stories of being unable to interact with the limiting world we live in — which made a permanent impact on my perspective as a designer. I continued my research on the relationship between design and disabilities and interviewing people from the community over the years — this became a way to teach myself about accessibility and equipped me with the Principles of Inclusive Design and the Principles of Universal Design whenever I created anything, from graphics and products to experiences and events. Accessibility has since become a passion of mine, and as a graphic designer at Canva there is a natural inclination for me to introduce inclusive design principles into my day to day work. So through this blog post I’d like to share my learnings with you in the hopes that every designer who reads this will be able to incorporate inclusive design principles in their work. I’ll go into: Creators hold a unique power to shape the world with their work. This is especially true for designers — individuals professionally tasked to style how everyone else interacts with their craft. From designing buildings, websites, software and devices, to the way we experience our surroundings and the manner in which we take in information — a designer has an unsurpassable amount of impact on the way we live our lives. Until recently, many of us were perfectly satisfied with how mainstream designs conformed to our needs. But progress and the growing cultural shift towards inclusivity has shown us that this isn’t entirely true. We are now starting to realize how we’ve created a world that largely conforms to the needs of the majority and excludes those whom we think is a very small minority. However, there are over one billion people with disabilities in the world. That means 1 out of 7 people live with some form of disability — hardly something I would call a “minority.” Anyone learning this will most likely also realize the importance of building our world in a way that provides equal opportunities for everyone. And it is our responsibility as good designers to create things that are equally functional for both PWDs and able-bodied people. PWDs don’t find their impairment a huge hindrance to live a good life. It is the man-made world that they find to be disabling. According to the World Health Organization , a disability is a combination of one’s impairment, a poorly designed environment (or product), and one’s inability to participate. Through my research and interviews over the years, it became clear to me that PWDs don’t find their disability a hindrance to live a good life. It is the man-made world they find to be disabling. It breaks my heart to learn that in many colleges around the world, design students are not taught to consider the needs of people with disabilities. Since we assume that they are a small portion of the population, we also assume that they have their own sets of needs and they need special products or should just modify mainstream products themselves to match their needs. This is unnecessary, if students are made aware of how easy it is to democratize design to include PWDs as users of their products. Simply put, exclusion is something that good design can prevent. Upon learning so much from PWDs, traditional design principles didn’t seem enough to me anymore — it didn’t make sense to me to only design for people with typical bodies and abilities, because doing so would be to intentionally exclude millions of people. It’s this realization that propelled me to think about how we need to incorporate inclusive design principles into Canva’s library of templates and media assets. Human-centered design is a creative approach that starts and ends with people. It starts with comprehensive research into the people we’re designing for and ends with design solutions for real people and their different realities. According to the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) , inclusive design places people at the heart of the whole design process in order to create environments that are: inclusive, responsive, flexible, convenient, accommodating, welcoming, and realistic. I believe the same is true for any design. The philosophy behind it stems from a deep empathy for our fellow humans, born from an understanding that everyone’s experience of life is different. All that human-centered and inclusive design really seeks to do is empower and enable people to participate equally. A big misconception about design is that it’s centered on making things pretty. But at its core, design is really about creating great experiences—and that should include people who experience disabilities like low vision, color vision deficiency (aka color blindness), and deafness, to name a few. Many design teams do want to incorporate accessibility into their designs, but mistakenly think that it is difficult to do and difficult to learn — but it really isn’t. Inclusive design is simply good design. One just has to understand the basic principles of Inclusive Design (and Universal Design) and keep them in mind whenever designing anything. Basically, this means making sure that designs are usable by as many different people as possible, without the need for people to modify it to be usable. Once you grasp the principles, it becomes easy to understand the accessibility guidelines for one’s design discipline, whether it’s urban planning, architecture, built environment, industrial design, UX design, or graphic design. Best of all, these guidelines are readily available and free. What’s great is that most accessibility features are quite simple to implement, and often just involve letting go of some practices we’ve considered the norm. Any other technical details, like human factors and engineering concerns, can be addressed by interviewing users with disabilities or asking them to help test out your design — which most are more than happy to do. For multimedia designs, for example, users with the following needs have the most difficulty: By understanding users’ needs, it becomes easy to incorporate inclusive features in multimedia designs, whether you are working with images, motion graphics, presentations, videos, or print. It is important to understand what types of things they have difficulty perceiving, and decide what feature you can incorporate to fill this gap. The basic idea is to make your design multisensory by providing at least two ways for information to be perceived and understood. As you go along, you will find that you will start thinking of other possible inclusive features or solutions yourself. When you do, we’d love to hear about it in the comments section! Some designs can be produced and released in a few hours, but some designs take months and involve different teams within a company. For example, you may be a graphic designer working on media assets for a large project, like your company’s website, which will take months to release and won’t be updated regularly. Strategize as a team. Make sure everyone (e.g. Project Manager, Developer, Content Specialist, Information Architect, etc.) is on the same page and agrees as a team which features can be included immediately, which ones can be prioritized soon, and which ones can be scheduled later on. If you can, test your designs with members of the PWD community so you’ll know how you can further improve your designs. People often ask me, “Why do you care so much about accessibility?” or “Why PWDs?” and the reason is pretty simple: I take great pride in my work and I just want to be good at what I do. As a designer, I don’t ever want to design anything that prevents someone from doing something they are otherwise capable of doing. It is important to understand that people with disabilities do not need help or charity. Everyone strives to be independent, and to be able to do everyday things independently. All types of designers and technical professionals can help create a world that empowers PWDs through good design. This is one of the reasons I’m incredibly happy to be at Canva, where inclusion and diversity are deeply important because of our company values — one of which is to be a force for good. Canva has over 10 million users around the world — this means that seemingly small changes in our templates could actually impact the lives of millions. For me, realizing this was a lightbulb moment — we could introduce small changes in our product that will help support the PWD community. Here are a few of the initiatives we’ve been driving: PWDs often feel excluded when their needs are disregarded at events and public spaces. So we identified critical doc types like posters, tickets, programs, seating charts, social media doc types, and the like and included Accessibility Information to the smart templates we publish. Here are some examples: The idea behind this design decision is to help our users see the importance of inclusion by seeing this best practice while using Canva — and realize that this is something they ought to be doing. I’m hopeful that this becomes part of everyone’s awareness and can take appropriate steps when planning events. Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women in the world. To put the percentages into perspective, there are close to 300 million people who live with CVD and struggle with poorly designed materials every day. Our mission at Canva is to empower everyone to design anything, so we tried to think of how we could help our users living with color blindness feel confident about using Canva. In preparation for future features that will make that possible, we are currently doing the following: Great care was taken to make sure that the images of the PWDs look active and empowered . Our Image Team has helped us create a more inclusive marketplace by adding a sample of accessibility-related illustrations and vectors, making it easy for anyone to access diverse images from our library of content. What’s great about these three initiatives is that these are our own processes and so they did not require any additional resources. It was largely a matter of finding where best to incorporate the initiatives and when to start. Like most of our crazy big goals, it took a bit of brainstorming, extensive strategy writing, and updating process guidelines to get it done — and it wouldn’t have been possible without the team’s continued commitment to the initiatives we set out to do. From the digital space, we have taken this same idea to our physical space. We are making Canva’s office spaces accessible to guests and potential team members with disabilities. Below is a slideshow with all of the completed improvements of our Manila office expansion and renovation. Canva Manila - Accessible Office Features by Job Buenazedacruz We’ve included a screen reader version of this slideshow on the page. Let us know if you have any problems with the accessibility of this blog post, at [email protected] We’re still in the early stages of making everything on Canva accessible and inclusive to all; this mission aligns closely with our vision of empowering everyone to be able to design — with or without a disability. Impairments are a natural part of human diversity, just as we have diversity in race, gender, sexual orientation, and genetics. Some people with autism, for example, may have a unique and amazing type of intelligence; for instance, having strong declarative memory about certain subjects, or having incredible visual memory. These physical and intellectual variations add to the richness of human diversity and persons with disabilities should not be seen as a separate user base but part of a diverse population. As mentioned, inclusive design is not a special type of design — it’s just good design. What’s awesome about inclusive design is that a designer can make a difference just by doing their job well. An added bonus is that when we design for a wide range of needs, we come up with the best, most usable design possible, so everybody benefits.

With so many reasons to quit, sometimes throwing in the towel seems like the only way out. In this blog post, Canva CEO and co-founder Melanie Perkins shares her thoughts on how she overcame negativity on her way to building one of the world’s most successful companies, what to do when the going gets tough, and how determination and a strong support system can be your secret weapon for success. There are many, many reasons that may make you feel like you are on the outside. Your age, sex, gender identity, nationality, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, skin colour, ethnicity, religion, income, culture, upbringing, able-bodiedness, mental health, physical health, personality… the list of factors that tend to make people feel like they are on the outside is, unfortunately, endless. There are also many situations that can also make a person feel out of place. For many, it’s far from being a ‘feeling’, but is actually a terrible situation of abuse of power and outright discrimination. Over the last 12 months, we’ve certainly seen some of these horrible stones being turned over, and I sadly expect to see a lot more come to light over the years to come. So this piece isn’t aimed at the ‘discriminators’, the people that could and should do better, step up to the mark to help create a nicer, kinder, fairer world for everyone around them. This is for the people that for many reasons, feel like they are on the outside. I’ve had a few insights into not ticking a lot of the typical boxes. In fact, I tick very few boxes of a typical tech entrepreneur looking to raise investment from US venture firms and create a global company. I’m female, which apparently represents only 2% of venture capital funded CEOs. I’m Australian, and if you look at the likelihood of raising venture capital when you’re from my home-town Perth, the stats drop even further. If I were to look at all these discouraging stats, I probably would have shied away from even trying in the first place. However, I’ve learnt a couple of things along the way that have helped along our journey I wanted to share them with anyone who feels like they are on the outside, in the hope of helping you along your way. So here goes! Let’s get this one off the table to start with. There are a number of people in this world who are archaic and small-minded — and there’s almost nothing we can do about it. Just know that it’s their loss if they don’t want anything to do with you. If they can’t see past your (whatever factor they don’t like about you) they are probably too short-sighted to have long-term success anyway — at least that’s my optimistic view. There are more than seven billion people on this planet, which means there are a lot of really great people out there. Focus on finding the nice ones, and don’t worry about those that aren’t. I know when I travelled overseas for the first time as an adult it gave me a completely new and exciting view on the world — as I realised the little bubble that I lived in growing up was just that, a little bubble, not the whole world. Unfortunately, there are a number of instances where point #1 applies. We’ve seen this happen a lot recently with the #metoo, #timesup and #blacklivesmatter movements which have all raised awareness on some of the terrible things that occur. However if it’s possible, avoid attributing any rejection to point #1. If you can, blame that rejection on something you can control, rather than something you can’t. For Canva, it meant refining our pitch deck over and over again, refining our strategy, and pouring all of our energy into building a great company. Were we rejected because I didn’t tick the typical boxes? I have no idea, but actually I don’t really care — I’d always presume it was because our pitch deck wasn’t good enough, or our strategy not refined enough. Blaming rejections on things I could control meant I could use them as fuel to improve. Our standups have definitely changed over the years. But one thing has been constant — every Friday our team gets together and shares what they’ve been working on. In our earliest days we stood in a circle (pictured) and everyone shared what they’d been working on. We now have ‘Season Openers’ where each team presents the big goals they are working towards. One thing that has kept me going is the belief that if I work really hard, I can usually succeed at whatever I put my mind into — maybe not the first try, but by the hundredth (or more) tries I’ll nail it. Learning this at a young age has been like a magical superpower my whole life, because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If I try really hard and fail, it just means that I need to try harder and harder, until eventually I succeed. And then when I succeed I can attribute my success to trying really hard. It’s never too late to exercise the power of determination. Figure out something that you’d like to succeed at, and then do it. The first thing could be small. Learn to juggle. Learn to speak in public. Learn anything — work really hard for however long it takes you to succeed at that thing. Determination is like a muscle, the more you flex it, the stronger it gets. There’s a concept in psychology that I really like called ‘locus of control’, which was first described by American psychologist Julian Rotter in the 1950s. Rotter believed there are different degrees to which people believe they can control the outcome of events in their lives. People with an ‘internal locus of control’ believe they can control the outcome of events in their lives, whereas people with an ‘external locus of control’ believe they can’t. If you have an external locus of control, you have no power to change the outcome and so there’s no point in trying harder. Whereas if you have an internal locus of control, you can work hard and succeed. The problem with a lot of the conversation around discrimination is that it so often makes those in the discriminated group feel they don’t have control over their own outcomes and encourages an ‘external locus of control’, which makes people feel powerless. Anyone attempting to achieve any crazy big goal will face rejection and hard times as they embark on their journey. However if you are in a group that you perceive as an ‘outside’ group, it may feel like those rejections are because of some factor that you can’t control, rather than something you can fix (like your pitch deck or strategy). Don’t let this kind of thinking to discourage you from picking yourself up after a rejection and trying again. There’s a kind of beautiful self-selection process that happens when you are trying to pursue something when you don’t tick many of the typical boxes. The only people who invest in you, do so because they believe in you. Which means that of all the hundreds of investors that I’ve met over the years, the people who believed in me the most are the ones who ended up investing in our company. It’s pretty cool, because it means that in the end, we ended up with a great group of investors who believed in my vision. And on the flip side — if they didn’t believe in me, they didn’t get to work with our company. Find a team that shares your vision. To get Canva off the ground I had to believe in the vision for Canva for years before anyone else did (well other than my co-founders and family!). Years ago I read a beautiful book called ‘The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari’ by Robin Sharma, it said: “Yogi Raman once told me that as a boy, he lacked confidence as he was smaller than the other boys his age. While they were kind and gentle to him given their environmental influences, he grew insecure and shy. To cure this weakness, Yogi Raman would travel to this heavenly spot and use the lake as a picture screen for images of the person he hoped to be. Some days he would visualize himself as a strong leader, standing tall and speaking with a powerful, commanding voice. Other days he would see himself as he wished to be when he grew older: a wise sage filled with tremendous inner strength and character. All the virtues he wished to have in his life, he saw first on the surface of the lake.” These words have stayed with me ever since I first read them — you have to visualise exactly what you want to achieve before it can be turned into reality, whether that’s your own strength of character or your vision for the future. This photo was taken back in my Mum’s living room that we converted into our first office for Fusion Books, even though we were a very small ‘company’ we had very grand ambitions for what we could achieve. This is a photo taken during our Spring ‘Season Opener’ where we were celebrating our fifth birthday — we now have 350 amazing people at Canva. When we had just a handful of people at our first company Fusion Books we had a ‘red carpet’ event in our office. The red carpet was actually a small rug that we had to very carefully position the camera to ensure the edges of the rug didn’t show in the photo. I glued our company logo onto the back of the sign and it all made for some fun photos. I think we always had grander ambitions :) I touched on this point before, but essentially, if you don’t tick a lot of the ‘typical’ boxes when you look at the stats, the situation could look quite daunting. However when you succeed, you’ll help to change the stats. Any stats are just a reflection of what’s happened in the past, and with your work you can change the stats of the future. At Canva we have fun celebrations when we hit a big goal. While we are always dreaming about our next big goals and always feel like there’s a huge amount more to do, it’s really important to take a moment to celebrate each milestone along the way. Something we often say at Canva when things get challenging is that “If it were easy, it probably wouldn’t be worth doing”. Knowing that every single other person struggles is helpful knowledge. In our early days, I’d read press about startups, see their millions of users or huge funding rounds and think “Wow, it must be so easy for them”. However now, ten years since starting my first company and having met lots of other entrepreneurs, I know that there’s no secret formula and no such thing as an overnight success— just a lot of hard work and overcoming challenges one by one. I’m fairly certain that achieving anything in life requires a lot of hard work and persistence. This is one of my favorite quotes: I was looking back through some old notes from 2011, from a time when I was first trying to raise capital, sleeping on my brother’s living room apartment floor, and being rejected time and time again. I wrote a note to myself, giving myself some great advice: “Mel you’re extremely tired. You are in a challenging situation, though you can pull through. Nothing bad is really happening, you’re just feeling depressed because you are used to achieving things quickly. It’s a hard environment. There is no doubt you will succeed and you will find the team you need, get the investment you need and build the company you have always wanted. You have chosen to put yourself in a challenging situation. If it wasn’t challenging you wouldn’t feel as satisfied when you get to the end goal.” Remember that every single person on this planet struggles for one reason or another. Everyone has self-doubt. Realizing that the struggle is a normal part of the process for every single person can be very empowering. When we first built Canva we put it in front of people to do some user testing. After many years of trying to land investment and build a tech team, then another year developing the product, we were extremely disappointed to see that people were apprehensive about using our product: they weren’t clicking around, they weren’t exploring and they weren’t creating the awesome designs that we had dreamed they’d be able to. People had a belief that they couldn’t design, that they weren’t ‘creative’ enough and therefore didn’t click around or explore. I spent some time reading about gamification and decided to try and turn our onboarding into a ‘fun challenge’. We created ‘five starter challenges’, each challenge was progressively harder — but every time they ‘won’ a challenge like ‘searching for a hat and putting it on a monkey’, they developed a little more confidence in their own design abilities and felt ready to tackle the next challenge. The only thing that has been constant throughout our company’s journey is that there has always been a new challenge that we needed to overcome. In my first company, Fusion Books, we had to become profitable quickly or we’d have no company — so that was one of our first challenges. Then it was building a tech team. Landing investment. Growing an awesome community. There are constantly new challenging obstacles, and learning to love challenges — even those that seem insurmountable — is a an important part of the journey. #CanvaLove captures all the amazing support from our design community. Every challenge we overcome has the potential to help them reach their goals. A peculiar tendency I’ve noticed is that when people feel like they are on the ‘outside’ for whatever reason (and I’ve noticed this trait in myself too), they don’t ask for feedback as much as they could. Whilst asking for feedback can make anyone feel vulnerable, it’s one of the quickest ways to learn rapidly. The very simple question ‘what can I do to be more effective?’ will give you huge insights to learn and develop. Asking for feedback may come more naturally to some people than others, but once you’ve done it a couple of times it will feel a lot less daunting. Eventually you’ll learn to love feedback because you’ll get to experience the huge benefits of that honest, real-time knowledge on areas you can improve. We’re all definitely learning as we go (I certainly am!), and I think that when people find themselves in new situations they haven’t been in before, there are generally two distinct reactions — one is to ask for help from everyone around them, and the other is to try and do it all by themselves. I think when people feel like they are on the ‘outside’, it can feel even more uncomfortable asking for help, because it looks like they don’t know what they are doing. But asking for advice and support is another very quick way to learn. When we were raising our first round of capital, instead of asking if an investor wanted to invest, we’d ask if they were willing to give us some advice on our pitch deck. After doing this for 3 years, each time working really hard to improve our pitch, we eventually landed investment. I think it’s pretty important to know that every single person is going through their own trials and tribulations. I haven’t met a single founder, or a single person who’s working towards achieving huge goals, that have had things handed to them on a silver platter. I think knowing that everyone is struggling to make things work, and feels like they are on a rollercoaster and pedaling as quickly as they can, is mightily powerful. Knowing that it’s tricky for everyone, that any adventure will be filled with rejections and littered with obstacles — somehow makes the adventure a little less lonely. And it’s most important for people who feel like they are on the outside to know this. Regular coffee catch-ups are a simple yet effective way for us to recenter. What we need in this world is a broad range of people achieving crazy big goals across every single industry. The stats can look frightening and it can seem intimidating when it’s not a well trodden path, but let’s pave the path forward towards a better tomorrow, and create the world that we all want to live in. In the end, we’ll change our future and see much better stats — for everyone :) For more details on our current job openings, visit Canva’s careers page here .

{"website": "Canva", "title": "The difference between being a good product manager and a great one", "author": ["\nShipra Mahindra\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/startup-product-management/", "abstract": "Being a product manager at Canva has taught me to move fast and make high impact decisions that move the needle, even when there’s uncertainty. As we grow, it’s important to remain agile and flexible with our approach-but it’s not always easy to keep growing while maintaining the best of our startup DNA! Working as a product manager in my previous roles, my primary responsibility was to maintain an ongoing user base—it was as simple as that. But everything changed two years ago. All I knew about product management was turned upside down when I joined Canva. Not long after I joined, I realized that if I stuck to the traditional ways of doing things, I would simply be the bottleneck slowing us down. Startups demand quick iteration—the ability to build minimum viable products (MVPs)—and as such they require leadership from minimum viable product managers (MVPMs). The value of a product is in what gets used, not simply what gets built. Every PM is focussed on maximizing value, both for our users and for the business—but the difference between being a good PM and a great PM at a startup lies in one’s ability to work in an unpredictable, often volatile, space. Some of the key lessons I’ve learnt over the years: How to do #MVP #productmanagement manager with @canva 's Shipra Mahindra pic.twitter.com/Y6GIcO3ae4 In more traditional, established businesses, while there is some level of autonomy, most strategic decisions are top-down and driven by multi-layered management who are responsible for making the calls and drawing up the strategies that we as PMs then find ourselves implementing. Mapping out the game plan at Canva has always been a collaborative process, where I’ll find myself working alongside the main stakeholders, experts within industries, and the founders—often all at once. This ethos of collaboration is also brought to the team. It’s important to bring back a problem (not a ready-made solution) to the team so that they are involved from the start. Pick an engineer and a designer to kick off with, and share the full context with as much color about the problem as you can include, such as all the relevant constraints (time, people, money, and tech). Then work with them to brainstorm various solutions and test these out. The advantages of implementing collaboration are: A recent issue I presented back to the team was that our users found that editing large, printable designs such as posters, resumes, presentations was difficult to do on a phone. We received some feedback saying they weren’t able to tap on or select small elements in their designs, had difficulty in aligning things and wanted to zoom in to see more details. Along with the feedback, I presented the team video recordings of the users trying to edit large designs. After brainstorming solutions, we came up with a bunch of improvements such as making the screen tappable area expand in ratio to the element size, better snapping and more sensitive resizing behaviors. In the end our solution went through a few iterations taking into account user feedback—and we were then able to ship an awesome feature set. An example of the zooming feature An example of the Snaplines feature and the Tappable Areas feature. In a large business, usually several people are responsible for different parts of building and shipping a product. At a startup like Canva you have the opportunity to change elements and solve problems at various stages across the entire end-to-end cycle—from our landing pages to the signup screens, the editing tool, and downloading the design screens. There is no part of the product that is out of your scope as a PM, and very few hard limits to what can be done with the product. This means you are always empowered to think big and solve a problem holistically with the aim of improving the full end-to-end user experience. In a large company, there are various roles responsible for different parts of product development. And the list can go on… At a startup, you could potentially be doing all of this yourself—often at the same time. I remember spending a couple of days testing the iPhone app, while raising bugs for every release and simultaneously acting as a scrum master for the team. You’ll find yourself juggling a lot of different roles at the same time—whatever it is your team needs you to do. The startup environment therefore requires a different type of PM to a big business. Because there’s always so much in the pipeline, you have to constantly prioritize what you can do in order to move the team and the company forward, i.e. what is the minimum amount of work that can have the highest impact. Working in a fast paced environment means there isn’t always lot of time to sit down and spend long hours researching. Often it’s easier or more efficient to ask friends or family to test your product, “dogfood” it within your organization, or use usertesting.com to get quick validation. The quickest thing to test is usually a prototype— at Canva, we use Invision and Principle to create click-through prototypes and test them. This may not always provide you with complete validation but gives you a starting point from which to base your decisions. It’s important to get comfortable with using incomplete user data, and rely on your intuition to make small, quick decisions. Also keep in mind that it’s easier to ship and validate small changes rather than larger features. Always think about how you are going to ship an incremental UX flow—what is the smallest change that can prove that a feature adds value for our users and how can you build on that? At the end of the day you can have security in the thought that as your product and startup grow, so will your data and the opportunities for user research and testing. As compared with most other businesses, the nature of a startup is such that while you have a clearly defined vision, frequent change is the norm. As such you won’t find yourself planning more than six months into the future. This doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t or don’t have any long-term vision— in fact, having a long-term vision of what the product should look like in 12 months is crucial to making sensible short-term decisions and optimization. What is does mean, however, is that you can always choose to delay certain decisions. For example, one of our early objectives was to launch Canva in 20+ languages. But learning from our team’s experience on Web, rather than tackling that seemingly impossible feat all at once, we decided to focus on introducing one new language first-Spanish-and planned just enough to launch this. Because of this change in direction, we were able to pilot things with one language, which informed the processes we then set up to launch and manage 20 languages, such as: The process of translating our app into Spanish was unchartered waters for us. So focusing on just one language meant we would be able to use the learnings from this launch to inform our scaling decisions down the line. As such, today Canva is available in 108 languages and have a growing global team . The Canva mobile app localized in Spanish Two and a half years ago we were four engineers, one designer, and myself on the Mobile team. We used to sit at the same table and talk to each other multiple times throughout the day. To kick off a new project we would only need a single document outlining the ‘what’, ‘why’, ‘how’ and the ‘user happy path’ UX flows. This was a living document that was used as a reference throughout the project. Everyone added details to the document as required—to record decisions being made or to specify analytics and so on. It was sufficient and met the purpose of aligning everyone throughout the project. As the team grew to more than 25 engineers, three designers and three product managers; we needed a lot more documentation and process. Each document was written to solve a particular problem within the team or meet a certain purpose. Similar to writing valuable documents that solve problems, aim to only add a process or structure where it solves a problem. Inevitably adding processes can slow things down and in an environment that needs constant adapting and pivoting, it’s logical that we delay this until it is deemed completely necessary. When the mobile team was small, we used to do ad hoc App releases whenever we were ready to ship something valuable. That meant that App releases could be one week apart or up to eight weeks apart. As a team we decided that we wanted to get into a cadence for shipping some value to users on a more regular basis. We agreed that it wasn’t necessarily features that we wanted shipped but smaller things—such as bug fixes or performance improvements—that had a huge impact for our users. As the team grew, we also had more capacity to ship more things. At this point we decided to implement a fortnightly release process. To start off we kept things simple—we documented what happened as part of an ad hoc release and put in place a rotational ‘Release Cop’ role to follow that script every two weeks. Since then, we have standardized the release process a lot more, automated many parts of it and built in things like writing a ‘What’s new?’ user-facing message, importing string translations, phased rollouts and so on. Being in the constantly changing environment of a startup can be exhilarating and an amazing opportunity to learn something new every day. I’ve learned to be flexible, deal with uncertainty, and make quick, high impact decisions that have moved us closer to achieving our vision of empowering everyone to design anything and publish anywhere. As Canva grows, some of these skills will not be as important any more, as more information and data become available and we put more processes in place. However, the mindset of doing the number one thing with the highest impact will always be relevant. This is a strong part of the culture at Canva and continues to help us move as quickly as we can. In today’s world, where staying ahead is one of the keys to survival—I challenge you to think about how you can bring this mindset to your work.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "How we doubled Canva’s engineering growth rate in 6 months", "author": ["\nRick Goodfellow\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/doubling-engineering-growth/", "abstract": "A company’s ability to ship product ultimately lies in the ability of the recruitment function to support the team with new engineering talent. But what do you do when you’re faced with a talent shortage, and a company that has an ambitious product roadmap? Head of Talent Acquisition at Canva, Rick Goodfellow reveals how the team introduced a few changes to its recruitment process to help meet this demand. It’s a universal problem I see every in-house recruiter face when trying to scale up an engineering team. When a company like Canva has an ambitious product roll-out plan, it’s no longer a question of how it can hire more engineers to ship product - the challenge is how to make more hires quickly, without compromising on skill and capability or negatively impacting other parts of the business. So while it can be tempting to bring in more recruiters in a bid to unlock the candidate pool, the key is to first look into optimizing the effectiveness of one’s current hiring process - which has absolutely nothing to do with the size, or the ability, of our talent acquisition team. This is what I was brought in to do at Canva when I joined the team earlier this year. Having helped build Google Australia’s engineering team from scratch, there were some lessons I was able to bring in to my new role, starting with how we could improve our recruitment process for engineers. There were a couple of areas we needed to work on to be able to scale to the size we needed to and reduce the amount of time that our engineers spent interviewing per hire, namely: In this blog I’ll explain how we’ve overcome these challenges and increased the chances of having more of our candidates pass our stringent interview process and receive a job offer. Our wall of new starts As mentioned earlier, there were many factors at play that were stifling our hiring rate - and they had little to do with the size or the ability of our talent acquisition team. In fact, when we took a step back and crunched the numbers, what we found was approximately only one in 15 candidates would eventually pass all the interviews to receive a job offer from Canva. In addition, we were losing 500 candidates a year through a fall-out during the interview process, where candidates found themselves changing their mind and deciding not to pursue this opportunity due to the time taken to complete our process. What this equates to is a loss of at least a minimum of 33 potential hires each year, which signifies a leak somewhere that needed to be fixed as this would be one of the most straightforward ways to revitalize our candidate pool. Why was only 1 in 15 candidates passing our final interviews? It’s hard assessing a technical skill-set from a CV, so our recruiters were being asked to jump through an almost impossible hoop. Without the experience to technically screen we were relying on technical skills to be tested later in our process, taking up lots of time for our engineers who had to interview everyone. So first and foremost, we needed to put only the best candidates through the pipeline. We did this by: We decided to introduce a technical interview conducted by a recruiter, designed to gauge whether a candidate had the proper fundamental computer science knowledge. This would enable us to put higher quality candidates into the interview pipeline. As a result, the successful candidate would have a significantly better chance of performing well throughout the rest of the process and the probability of a job offer would increase. Revamping our screening process was going to require lots of work from everyone at Canva — our engineering teams, our interviewers, and our talent acquisition team. That meant it was important to explain the rationale behind the changes, and get buy-in from people to help us make the change. For us, that meant showing how this change would provide a benefit for each group, leading to: Crunching the numbers, we worked out that if recruiters could screen out approximately 40% of candidates we would previously have put into the interview process, we could potentially save up to 600 hours engineering hours spent interviewing per year from the recruiter screen alone. We met with all the different engineering functions at Canva separately to show them the issue at hand, and how introducing a recruiter technical screen will help them hire better - then, we asked for their help. One of the worst things we could do would be to rely on subjective data to qualify applicants. As with many startups, our initial candidate pool was created through word of mouth. Someone would recommend a friend for an interview, others would hear about job openings through the grapevine. But what was missing was a strategic approach to identify a set of skills criteria for the roles we were looking to hire, enabling us to create questions to gather the data points required to make a qualified assessment. It was therefore important to ask ourselves - what skills do we need, and how do we test for them? With this in mind, together with the engineering team we drafted an assessment criteria for each engineering role, designed to reflect the company’s needs and priorities, leaving any second guessing behind. What this meant was we were no longer comparing whether one candidate was as good as, or even better, than our latest hire. Not only was this subjective — we were not relying enough on data points to assess a candidate’s ability to meet specific criteria for the role, encouraging us to hire people similar to who we have hired previously — we were also missing out on diversity of opinions and approach, and the opportunity to bolster on our engineering skill set, which is crucial for growth. We needed to assess candidates against a documented set criteria for each individual role in engineering. This is one way we can help minimize bias—conscious or unconscious—when deciding whether or not to hire at the decision meeting. It’s a problem many high growth startups face. In our desire to produce and iterate, people could be brought on with minimal formal assessment - a lot of the review process was based on attribution or gut feel. The qualification of candidates relied too much on the opinion of the interviewer, and not enough on data to show how the candidate met the criteria for the role. Unfortunately, it’s virtually impossible to collect evidence of unconscious bias, but companies can put a process in place to discourage this from happening - and one way is to simply agree on the assessment criteria beforehand. A well-defined list of set criteria helps us better qualify the right people for the role and reduce potential bias in the process. The next step was to draft a series of questions that could be used to assess candidates. Together with Joel Hynoski , who looks after the growth and culture of Canva’s engineering function , we set up project groups to work on various sets of questions for different areas of engineering here at Canva. When preparing questions, it was important to consider the following: Because the prescreen questions were created to require a clear and well-defined answer, it was therefore possible to teach someone, regardless of their engineering experience, to understand what a good answer would look like. The next step was adding all the questions to Canva’s applicant tracking system so we could track candidate’s responses to various questions. From this data we could predict the percentage of candidates that will thrive in the next stage of the recruitment process, and anticipate their pass rates in the final interview, enabling us to better forecast growth. What this has also allowed us to do is validate each question accordingly. By introducing a prescreen step, we’ve been able to screen out candidates that would otherwise have been eliminated at a later stage, and by introducing set assessment criteria for each role we can be more confident of our decision when offering or rejecting candidates. The main point of this exercise however was to reduce the time engineers spend interviewing per hire, so that we could scale at the desired rate without negatively impacting the development of our product. Due to the recruiters being able to put higher quality candidates into the process, andthe assessment criteria being in alignment at each stage, the pass through rate to offer at the most time consuming stage, the final interview, dramatically improved. This reduced the engineering time spent interviewing per hire. So far we have managed to reduce engineering time spent interviewing per hire down to 20 hours compared to 30 hours last year. This saves 1000 hours of engineering time over 100 hires, enabling us to scale at the desired rate and minimize any negative effect on the growth of the product itself. Traditionally, we would screen hundreds and hundreds of resumes, and whoever looked good on paper would be invited in for a chat. That was a lot of time spent on spruiking Canva, as most candidates were already in comfortable positions with another company. Despite Canva being a reputable tech startup worldwide, it was still a hurdle to get candidates onboard with our recruitment process. A large part of the difficulty was the need to persuade every candidate to embark on a take-home challenge, which often took 5 hours to complete in their spare time, just for a chance to move on to a final interview onsite. In fact, this is where 40% of our engineering candidates dropped out. We had to take a step back, and think about whether a 5 hour challenge was just too much for some. They could be busy with kids or a hobby, or just too stressed with their current job to be able to dedicate the time. This hypothesis was put to the test. We introduced another option for candidates - they were now able to choose between having a take-home challenge, which they could do in their own time, or a live coding interview with an engineer over a shared live environment. This interview would only take an hour, but would test for exactly the same criteria. If this worked, more candidates would be able to continue with the interview process and the probability of having more great candidates pass through to the final stage of interviews would increase. It is important to cater to different working styles. Because we were introducing a new concept to a very traditional challenge, we needed to demonstrate how introducing an additional option to the take-home task would potentially increase our candidate pipeline by 40%. Once we were aligned, we were able to create a new live coding challenge that would assess the same skills as the take home version. The difference between a take-home challenge and a live coding interview lies in a person’s ability to solve an engineering problem under two different environments: a candidate could choose to peruse and solve the problem at their own pace, or decide to try and tackle the same engineering problem with the interviewer watching you refine your answer - mistakes and all. It was important to revisit the performance of these challenges to ensure every question was doing what it was designed to do. Based on feedback from our candidates, one of the options we implemented was to allow a candidate to code in their own preferred integrated development environment (IDE), rather than one we prescribed. This was particularly important in a live coding interview, as the candidate would be inclined to perform much better in a time restricted test using their own tools, as opposed to one they were not necessarily fluent in. Introducing this additional option resulted in surprisingly positive results. The team managed to reduce the dropout rate in our interview process from 40% to 0%. Literally every candidate we had spoken to chose to participate in one challenge or the other. But more interestingly, the team found that there was an even split between candidates who decided to choose the take home challenge and those who opted for the live coding interview. By accident, we realized our process was now accommodating the different ways people like to solve problems. Some people prefer to take their time and work on their own, whilst others like to collaborate in real-time. The new process we introduced was able to cater to different backgrounds to suit a diverse range of working styles. At the end of the day, we want to ensure we’re providing a great experience for every single candidate that comes through our recruitment funnel, and accommodating for different perspectives and approaches to problem solving. Some of our new happy intakes It was great to see 40% more candidates entering the pipeline, however even though we have reduced engineering time spent per hire, specific engineers were still conducting the majority of the interviews. We needed a more structured approach to train up new interviewers to be able to spread the workload. For us, interviewing at an optimal level means we’re screening out unsuitable candidates as early as possible before they reach the most time consuming parts of the process, enabling a better pass through rate at the final stage. However we still needed to ensure that particular interviewers, including recruiters, were not being overloaded— defeating the purpose of what we were trying to do in the first place, i.e. saving them time. With this in mind, we put in place two immediate changes that would help all engineers interview at an optimal level. We used to train engineers how to interview on a very sporadic basis, resulting in an increased burden on engineers who were more experienced. Today, our engineers are trained in batches using a defined set of criteria and coursework to ensure they are fully equipped to interview effectively at every stage. Every engineer is also required to participate in a minimum of two shadow interview sessions to give them real-life experience. To help optimize the team’s time, we made the decision to bring in a scheduling assistant. Our assistant was able to take a lot of the scheduling and administration work from our recruiters, so the talent acquisition team could focus on identifying the right candidates. Some of our assistant’s responsibilities include ensuring our engineers are completing all their training and shadowing sessions in batches, so that we can have 20-30 engineers trained up to speed each month. Since our assistant joined, we’ve been able to give the recruiters 35 hours back per week to find and technically screen candidates. These new recruitment processes have been a game changer for Canva. It didn’t happen overnight, but the effects have been significant and worth replicating. In 3 months alone, we have doubled the number of engineers that we’ve been able to hire compared to last year without adding more recruiters. Only time will tell if this hiring spike will continue, but with these new and improved recruitment initiatives and the traction that Canva is experiencing on all fronts in product and market growth, all arrows are pointing up.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Rethinking our mobile growth strategies", "author": ["\nRenee Psomadelis\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/mobile-growth-strategies/", "abstract": "We’re getting to the stage where mobile internet usage is set to overtake desktop. In some parts of the world people’s first experience of the internet is through their low-cost smartphone. This new way of consuming content is seeing a shift in the way in which companies like Canva work and the ways in which we seek to reach millions of users across the globe. While the reality is that everyone in the company is working on ‘growth’, the dedicated Mobile Growth team at Canva have their own focused set of goals including to: ‘Design anything. Publish anywhere’ is our mantra. It’s through this mantra that we enable our users to use Canva on their preferred choice of device, through which we then hope to build some of the most loyal users in the world. With the increasing importance of mobile, we’re always looking for ways to increase the number of our cross-platform users and ensure we’re always offering them a smooth experience. The mobile growth squad at Canva formed late last year with the purpose of testing everything from: landing page CRO, driving owned media installs through desktop placements, email and push campaigns, App Store Optimization, to in-app experiments. We work in an environment where we are constantly testing hypotheses and aren’t afraid to change things up when we see that they aren’t working as successfully as we would like them to. It’s important for us to learn as fast as possible and understand that solutions to all problems can’t be solved in one iteration. In this article I’ll talk about a few of the things the Mobile Growth team at Canva have worked on over the past 12 months, and some lessons learned along the way. I’ll group these learnings into three basic areas: Experimentation, Internationalization, and App Store Optimization (ASO). Some of Canva’s Mobile Team As with most experiments or product growth initiatives at Canva, mobile growth experiments themselves are focused on getting users to the app, getting them to publish their first design, and driving them back into the app.\nHere are a couple of examples of experimentation around owned media acquisition and retaining users through push. With 10+ million users already designing in Canva, we launched a dialog box on desktop that we show to our users after they publish a design. This meant that after they had published on desktop we were able to promote our mobile apps to them. Promoting the mobile apps within Canva’s desktop app. Click image to enlarge. Once users have reached their ‘aha moment’ on the platform they found you on, in this case desktop; we can take the opportunity to let them know about the cool things they can do on their mobiles. Prior to the Android launch we used it as a way to collect phone numbers and these users received an SMS once we launched. Sending users directly to the app stores on desktop (a) breaks the user flow and takes them away from your product and (b) isn’t a great user experience for desktop users—while it’s a little better on Google Play, you can’t actually install an iOS app from desktop. We wanted to make it as simple as possible, by allowing users to SMS themselves a link to their mobile. They tap on the SMS and are taken to the relevant app store. This is fairly common practice across many websites but we ran an experiment to drive more app users from this placement. The original SMS dialog was two steps—first you selected iPhone or Android, moved to a different screen and then we asked you to enter your phone number. Users were required to enter their phone number with the correct country code, otherwise the SMS would fail. The experiment involved combining the two steps of phone number entry into one; and also detecting the user’s country and pre filling their country code for them so they could enter their phone number more naturally. We were confident that the variant would perform better than control as it was quicker, easier and less prone to human error. We decided to test out our messaging for the two variants to get some further learnings from the test. V1: We showed a mobile device—pretty simple right? We’re pushing the mobile app and here’s a giant image of a phone you can’t miss. Click image to enlarge. V2: And we created a text-heavier variant where we actually listed out the benefits of the mobile app. But we assume people don’t always take the time to read things right?… Click image to enlarge. The winner of V1 and V2: V2 saw 21% more phone numbers submitted over V1. It turns out people do read things, and in a world where we’re continually told to “Go mobile”, it can help to lay out specific benefits and uses of the mobile app for your audience—test and see if it works in different situations though. Winner overall: As was expected, reducing the number of steps and helping users enter their phone number in a more familiar format more than doubled the average number of phone numbers submitted each day. The winning variant was shown to 100% of users as of December 12, as a result we saw an increase in users submitting their phone number and app installs as a result. Push notifications are a great great way for us to engage our mobile users. At Canva we use them for activation and retention purposes. While we send many types of push notifications; many of our engagement and retention pushes are based on current events. Push is a great channel for this kind of thing for a couple of reasons: An example of push notifications TIP: Set a control group If you send a push notification on Christmas Day to your entire user base and are pleased to look at your results and see a spike in Christmas cards sent, you may just be looking at the impact of the day—not your push alone. The point of sending these campaigns is to bring about an increase in engagement above and beyond what your users would have done regardless of your push. For event-based push notifications we see improvements of 15% in designs shared in the group that received the push over those the didn’t. Both groups saw a spike on the day of the event because people were more likely to share a design on the day, but we see that the push caused an additional uplift. Push notifications allow us to test emoji vs. no emoji, shorter copy vs. longer copy, day before event vs. day of event, and several other such factors. However, at first our event based experiments began by purely testing if our push themselves were having an impact on these already high-volume days at all. With growing numbers of people opening their email on mobile, we wanted to improve the engagement and acquisition firepower of our email campaigns.\nWe use Branch , a mobile linking platform which powers deep linking. This allows us to link directly from our landing pages, emails, and other assets to our mobile apps. Where the optimal experience on mobile is within the mobile app—editing a template for example—users that click on the CTA in an email will experience one of two things: Use case #1: User already has the app installed and taps on a design in an email from their mobile device. They’re taken straight through to edit that design. Use case #2: User flow for someone that does not already have the app installed. After installing the app and signing in, they will be deeplinked to the template they tapped on in the email. If the experience is better on web, e.g. an article on our Learn Blog , we take users directly to the web URL and don’t thrust the app on them. However, where there are templates highlighted in the article, we use Branch links to deep-link mobile users into the apps to edit. Improving our cross-platform experience is something my team and I are continuing to test and improve on. Canva’s mission is to empower the world to design. With over 80% of mobile users in Brazil and India using Android devices, launching the Canva app for Android in November 2017 had a huge impact on growth at Canva. In a few short months we quickly reached five million Android installs and international markets such as these will continue to be the key to our overall mobile Monthly Active User (MAU) growth. Canva’s mobile apps are localized into more than 50 locales, but there are a variety of factors we need to take into account when planning out our mobile growth in international markets. Here are a few differences in markets beyond just language to think about: Device memory or storage as well as network speeds vary across the world. These can affect retention rates or conversion from the storefronts if a user is simply unable to install the app in the first place or it’s impossibly slow to use. We look to optimize the experience from the moment users open the app, sign up, find a template and then share their design. We know that a one-size fits all approach is not going to provide us with maximum growth. We also see that push notifications or in-app experiments can vary between markets, so this is something that requires testing. We know that there are variances in price sensitivity and willingness to pay across different markets and platforms across the globe. This could have an impact on activation and retention rates for your app—both stores make it fairly simple to localize pricing for purchases. I’ll dive into this in more detail later but going back to the point about differences beyond language: You can complete localized keyword research to optimise your titles, descriptions and show localized screenshots, but you need to optimize for conversion on a market-by-market level. Google Play allows developers to A/B test in all languages your storefront is available in and we have seen different results for the same experiment in different markets—even among the US, UK, and Australia. Additionally, there are opportunities to give your Storefront a truly local feel and it can be worth putting a little extra time in. Mobile Operating System Market Share Brazil: May 2017 - May 2018. >80% Android. Source . Mobile Operating System Market Share India: May 2017 - May 2018. >80% Android. Source . There are no two ways about it, you need to put time into App Store Optimization (ASO) and it’s something I personally love working on. With over 60% of installs coming via App Store search the Storefronts are a vital piece of the getting-your-app-discovered puzzle. The groundwork needs to be laid to set up a good foundation for organic search and for optimising conversion when you do start sending more people to the Stores from other channels like landing pages, paid or owned media. Both the App Store and Google Play have made some significant changes in the past year and its important for us to look at ways to work with the Stores and improve our product pages to make the most of these changes. The new Google Play Store design puts more emphasis on screenshots. Source . With the massive overhaul of the App Store in 2017, we saw not only a thing of beauty, but more than just lists of apps shown in search results and curated lists. The coveted App Store feature which always brought about a spike in installs from users that weren’t really looking for your app—those who don’t have the greatest need to use your app and therefore are less engaged—now lives on in search results in the form of Stories. You get a longer life out of the editorial piece and are bringing in users with higher intent.\nIn saying that, where you previously had five apps in the top five of search results—below Apple Search Ads in many markets—your app is often now competing with a Story and promoted in-app purchases within search results. Making top rankings across high volume keywords all the more important. On the new App Store apps, Stories written by Apple Editorial, and promoted in-app purchases are all shown in search results. Prior to this, you were only competing with other apps for top position and visibility in search results. Now with so much more going on in search there are more opportunities for acquisition and driving revenue from search. At Canva our cross-platform users are our most loyal, so growing mobile and improving their experience is growing everything. It pays to come at it from all angles. Not just paid or organic, not just ASO, not limiting your changes to the in-app experience. We’ll continue to keep testing, so watch this space.", "date": "2018-06-29"},
{"website": "Canva", "title": "What I learned from Google and Lyft to scale our engineering culture at Canva", "author": ["\nJoel Hynoski\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/scaling-engineering-at-canva/", "abstract": "“It’s not just about scaling from 50 to 100 engineers. It’s not even about scaling to 200. I’m thinking about how we can scale to 1000 people and beyond.” This was the mission Cliff Obrecht (Canva co-founder and COO) set for me when I first sat down with him. It seemed like a crazy idea. At the time, we had just over 40 engineers, and were three and a half years into the Canva journey. I was being recruited as the first ever head of engineering. This might be one of those magical situations where everything falls into place, I thought. The right product at the right time, with the right people to build it. There’s no reason why we couldn’t reach a thousand engineers. But how would we preserve the magic as we split into different teams, disperse across office floors, buildings — and even countries? At the start of the journey, a small and dedicated fellowship ventures out on the quest. They know what they stand for, and they’ll do whatever it takes to get the job done. Every day is a learning experience. As more and more people join the mission though, how do you know what everyone stands for? How can one person feel empowered to set a new direction, and how do you realize the potential of every person? While I don’t claim to have all the answers, I’ve been in a lucky position to witness the growth of a few notable companies—Google from 2006-2013, and Lyft from 2015-2017, for example—and I’ve got a few ideas. From the 47 engineers we had at Canva when I joined in March 2017, we’re now at over 120, and I think we’re doing OK. This is very much a journey in progress. In this article, I’ll share a few of the things we’re doing at Canva to scale our engineering culture and processes. The core of an awesome, united team is a small set of shared understandings. This doesn’t mean a team powered by groupthink. What you want is a motley crew with a small set of common beliefs, which everyone is proud to hold—and perhaps stick onto their laptops. An engineering team planning session With 5 or 10 people, you can develop common understandings just by sitting around a table all day together. But when it comes to 40 or 50 engineers, the point at which I arrived at Canva, it’s definitely a different story—one worth committing to in some form of writing. Without a common set of values for how we approach engineering, I could see we would end up with big disparities between teams. Some would be following more effective practices, others less so. Some would be fostering one culture, others something different. People wouldn’t know what it meant to be an engineer at Canva. When I joined, we had some nascent ideas about ‘how engineering is done here’ , but they were fairly amorphous. Everyone knew we were aiming for ‘excellence in engineering’, but not everyone was aligned in what this meant, or had different interpretations of that idea. So while we already had a lot of good processes and teamwork in place—our code review culture was already very strong, for example— we needed to make sure the foundation was solid and included only practices that we wanted to maintain. So about a month after I joined, I started to scope out a set of engineering values for the team. How do you go about setting up and establishing team values? In my first engineering-wide email on the subject, I introduced it like this: Rather than impose a set of values on you all, I wanted to chat about some of the proposed ones that we could embrace, and get suggestions on how to word them, or add more, or subtract them—whatever we decide. It would have been easy enough for me to meet with a few of Canva’s earliest engineers, and pull together a list of values based on our observations. Instead, I committed to work out our values collaboratively, together with the team—however long that took. Why did I decide to do it this way? Ownership. It goes almost without saying that if the team creates a set of core values for themselves, they’re more likely to truly own them. Common knowledge. While this idea is a little trickier to grasp, among logicians this is actually a technical term. Common knowledge is what everyone knows that everyone else knows. It’s a kind of infinite recursion. You know something, you know that I know something, you know that I know that you know it, and so on. Anything less than this is simply referred to as ‘shared knowledge’—the knowledge is generally diffused throughout the group, but no-one is perfectly sure of who knows what. Research using game-theory models shows us that common knowledge makes a big difference when groups collaborate. Having a bedrock of understandings that can be assumed and rallied around without extra communication overhead makes groups much more efficient. In the case of common values, it’s no different. People have a common vocabulary—so today if people refer to being ‘pragmatic’ during a code review, everyone knows what that means in terms of our value ‘Aim for pragmatic excellence’. No one has to justify why they’re taking time to teach a newbie, because of our value ‘Take the time to teach each other’. If people want to change teams, they know they won’t need to learn a new set of working principles. But common knowledge is much harder to achieve than you’d think. Because it requires that everyone know what others know, it requires confirmation and clarification in a group setting, ideally a face-to-face setting. Unfortunately, you can’t just tell people what the team values are over Slack. So that’s where it helps to generate common values collaboratively. That way, you can be sure they really are commonly held. Editor team meeting. Photo: Nic Wittison Here’s how we did it at Canva: Brainstorm. Ideas are hard to generate in a vacuum, people need other ideas to bounce off. We all got together and spent some time generating post-its and discussing what engineering stood for at Canva. This gave us a shortlist of about 35 draft values. Collate. If people have similar ideas, that’s a good sign. We had a lot around learning, for example ‘keep getting better at your craft’ or ‘we’re always learning’. I worked with a couple of people to consolidate our draft values into 22 different themes. Workshop. In cohorts of 15-20, we voted on the values (the values were written on a whiteboard, and everyone had tally marks to allocate to their favorites). We then split into groups of 3-4, made Canva presentations around the most popular choices and presented them back to the cohort. This brought us down to 12 draft values. Note: In written form, a value is just a few words—so it’s important to generate some interpretation around them like this and capture the intent. Welcome Rethinking by David Hearnden Vote. The basic acceptance criteria for a value is whether it resonates with the team. So there’s no harm in eliminating a few ‘correct’ but less popular options. We chose our final set of values using a simple Google form, with the header “Don’t decide which presentation is the best, but instead which values resonate the most with you.” Voting on our engineering values And just like that, we had a set of values. No further convincing or buy-ins were necessary, because we’d taken the time to involve everyone in the process.\nCanva’s engineering values: Of course, the ownership and common knowledge of these values might diminish over time as more engineers come on board. And values that served us in the past might start to hamper our growth today. But who said values need to be set in stone? I plan to revisit the values periodically with the team, following a similarly collaborative process to the one I mentioned above. I doubt we’ll change them wholesale, but I’m open to that if necessary. A warning about the democratic process : Some values might sound great to the majority of your team, but still alienate others. It’s important to remind people throughout the process that values should be inclusive, as well as inspirational. We want to preserve the awesome minimum viable structure and culture of responsibility that we have at Canva. However, that’s not an easy thing to do as we grow close to 50 teams. To keep the structure of our engineering group as flat as possible, we want to empower every team and minimize their dependence on formal leadership. To do this, we’ve defined the things that each team needs to be doing, and collected them into a set of functions. These are roles that need to be fulfilled on each team, but the people that fill them during each ‘Season’ (three month period) can change. To keep with the metaphor of each team as a small, independent fellowship setting out on a journey with each a new goal, we envisage these roles as ‘backpacks’. Breaking it down, the first backpack is Coaching. The capacity of our engineering leadership to provide 1:1 time and support is quite limited. So it’s important that we hand out lots of these backpacks to people with appropriate experience. Next is Facilitating. It’s important that every every team stays goal-oriented and everyone has the right work assigned. This is the role of the facilitator. Finally, there’s the Navigators. They’re like the wise guide of the group—mentoring new people in the ways of the team, setting the technical directions, and making sure the code is up to scratch. Each ‘backpack’ has its own set of tools that it carries. ‘Facilitating’, for example, has things like project planning, using Jira, running retrospectives and reporting. While ‘Navigating’ has mentoring and giving feedback. Although there are a number of premade ‘backpacks’, we constantly encourage everyone to put whichever tools they may need or feel comfortable with in their own pack. “Wait, are these backpacks just hierarchy by another name?” you ask. “Is a ‘tech navigator’ just a tech lead after all?” In a way, that’s the role they fulfill. But the emphasis here is very important. Naming them this way helps people understand that they are responsibilities, not fixed roles. Responsibilities can be shared, and when a backpack gets heavy, someone else can shoulder the load. In some cases the contents of two packs can be combined, and someone can take on multiple responsibilities. In other cases they can be separated, and two people can do a job. Canva is growing so quickly that there will be responsibilities and possibilities for anyone who wants them. It’s about keeping the engineering culture of a startup—so anyone can reach out and take on tasks. With green fields of opportunity and growth all around us, we need everyone to have that sense of urgency. With so many new people coming on board, getting new team members up to speed is one of the most important things we do at Canva. However, there’s a few problems we have to contend with: Canva’s codebase is large, and so far we’ve prioritized shipping over documentation. A lot of responsibility has been placed on mentors, who’ve been doing a great job—but as a complete solution it’s not scalable. At Canva, we definitely have a culture of learning. Some of the core values chosen by the team include ‘Making sure we are constantly learning’, ‘Take the time to teach each other’, and ‘Constantly improving engineering’. I see people striving to learn new things every day. There’s no problem with creating a culture of learning; the key thing is ensuring we scale that culture. Here are some of the things we’ve been working on with regard to scaling a culture of learning: The image above sums up what we’re hoping to achieve with learning and development at Canva. We don’t want a ladder with a few rungs, so that our people skill up and then do the same thing forever. We don’t want a rung-less ladder, where the support for learning just isn’t there. We want our people to be able to continuously learn—the company is always growing, and as such we want our people to able to grow with it. But rather than just hoping that limitless learning will happen, we’ve been formalizing what we call ‘skills journeys’ for every specialty within Canva. A kind of framework, the engineering skills journey is based around five characteristics: For each of these characteristics, there is a continuum of skill progression that is represented in the chart for that characteristic. Engineering Journey by Joel Hynoski Just having a framework for learning like this is very important. People often used to come to me wanting to improve their skills, but not knowing where to start. By having these journeys set up, people are now able to see for themselves “this is where I am on the journey now, and to get to the next level I need to be doing these things”. Learning is supported by four internal partners: The idea for ‘Canva Engineering University’ is to provide a curriculum and peer-to-peer education to Canva engineers. A part of a wider ‘Canva University’ strategy we’re rolling out in the coming months; this allows us to successfully onboard newbies , develop their skills, and learn new skills. Having an internal ‘University’ means we are all able to work more effectively, and empower others to do their work. Engineers will be able to find both in-person and online courses with the recorded content they need, when they need it. Courses will include things like ‘An introduction to internal tooling’, ‘PR best practices’, and ‘Design React Components’. We’ve recently hired Dianah Ward , our Learning and Development Specialist who is working on rolling out the program, so watch this space! Onboarding at Canva It’s early days yet, but we’ve seen a lot of positive results from introducing our engineering values, distributing responsibility, and building out our skills journeys. Every day I see that our values are being taken to heart and helping people to think about their daily work in new ways. Take our value ‘Validate the problem’—which is all about making sure you’re solving the right problem, not just making sure you’re solving the problem right. When engineers get a request from a PM or a designer, instead of just going away and crunching out code for it, I hear them asking what it’s for and really trying to understand and validate the product thinking behind the feature. Likewise among engineers, our value ‘Aim for pragmatic excellence’ is really being taken into the culture. Pragmatic excellence is about building a minimal feature set and getting products shipped, while still balancing that with long term needs and scalability. Nowadays during code reviews it’s more common to hear people say “Are we over-engineering this? Could we build less now and do more later?”. Another important value has been ‘Evaluate ideas based on merit’. At a startup it can be easy to idolise the ideas of the early engineers—they’ve built the core code of the product, and they have a large personal stake in the company. It’s easy to fall into thinking that their opinion means more than yours, if you’ve only been around for two months. But I see this value freeing people up—everyone knows that regardless of their tenure at Canva, people will respect their ideas and evaluate them objectively. That’s helped a lot with onboarding, because new engineers know that their ideas will be taken seriously, and feel free to question the status quo—which is what we need to do, in order to continue growing engineering. There’s less tangible benefits from the values as well, like the cohesion of the engineering team. Even though we’re now split over three floors and many different projects, the way we work together is very consistent. There’s room for individuality among teams, but there is also alignment with a general vision and working style. Our Canva University is still in progress, but I see our skills journey framework being used often. People use it as a way to benchmark their own progress, and say “This is where I am today, this is where I want to be, and this is how I’m tracking”. It’s very empowering to be able to measure and steer that process of growth. In the end that’s what it’s about—from choosing the values, to distributing responsibility, to setting up the skills framework—it’s about empowering people and giving them control over their own journey at Canva. I’m confident that we’re keeping the core of Canva’s great engineering culture as we grow. Things will change, and there will be new challenges on the way, but our culture will scale to meet it.", "date": "2018-06-20"},

Complimentary yoga and gym passes. Flexible working hours. Huge training budgets. Despite the seemingly endless perks of most companies in the tech sector today, it takes more than just fringe benefits to attract and retain the best talent. In fact, engaging a new team member starts way before day one. At Canva, our full onboarding experience begins as soon as a candidate has signed their name on the dotted line. As part of Team Happiness (Canva’s HR Team), creating a newbie onboarding experience that’s both informative and exciting has been a huge priority for me. My team and I have been working on our goal of revitalizing the Canva onboarding program to make sure we’re setting our new Canvanauts up for success from the day they decide to join the team. In this article, I’ll share what we’ve learned from our experience with creating a new onboarding program that truly resonates with our new hires. Onboarding begins before you even start hiring for a role. For a new starter to be successful, it’s critical to know exactly what the goals for the new role are, the skills you require, and how this person will be expected to work with others on the team. This is why every season—three months—Team Happiness works with the different teams at Canva to help them plan for resourcing. We then set expectations for our Talent Acquisition team who are able to plan out the recruitment process. There are a few key people involved in this phase: The teams at Canva complete a hiring strategy and pull together some challenges (those that relate to the role in question and can be completed either in-house or as a take-home task) which are used to assess candidates. Hiring someone is the start of a relationship—it’s a two-way street. While it’s important that we get all the necessary information we need from the candidate during the interview process, it’s also important for us to give the candidate as much context as possible. Some things that candidates will want to know: NOTE: It’s important to open up about your company and engage the candidate on what it’s like to work at your company. It’s crucial to remember that not everyone works for a salary. People have different motivators and working out what they are will enable you to make an educated hiring decision, resulting in the perfect match for the role you are filling, and for the company overall. Grounding new starters in our company culture is just as important to us as making them feel welcome and empowered to do their best work on day one—and for the rest of their tenure with us. This means having a plan—letting them know what to expect, introducing them to the right people, and showing them where to go. Our onboarding plan provides every new starter with overall clarity on their team, including information such as who they will be working with, their initial goals, key contacts, systems and tools they’ll need, Slack channels and even a list of all our social clubs, ranging from wine club, board games club, music club, to name a few. An outline of our onboarding document: An example of an onboarding doc. Once someone has made the decision to join, there can often be weeks or months before they start—resigning from their previous role, moving countries, etc.—so you want to ensure you’re keeping them engaged. Think about the questions a new starter wants answered or what they may be uncertain about: When I first started Canva there were 116 people working in our Sydney office. Since then, I’ve been a part of onboarding more than 90 Canvanauts to date. Our CEO Melanie (bottom row) with our largest cohort of newbies in our Sydney office in March 2018. It’s important when you’re onboarding this many people through such a complex onboarding program that you leverage the right tools. Before their start date, we send out an email drip campaign using a great tool called Enboarder . This sequence of emails welcomes them, provides links to company videos about our culture, shows them what to expect, and allows us to ask a little about themselves. An example of an email sent through Enboarder before the newbie’s first day that let us get to know a little about them. We assign our newbies with a set of tasks to complete before their start date using our HR system BambooHR . This means they can hit the ground running from day one and get all the trivial tasks out of the way. Example of tasks assigned to a newbie before day one. Helping newbies feel less anxious and stressed so that they can focus on their work and goals from day one is an important part of our onboarding program. At Canva, we like to start our newbies on a Tuesday morning, so they have a shorter first week, and can take time to digest new routines and information without feeling overloaded or overwhelmed. This also means their teams can finish setting up on a Monday, ready for the newbie the following day. What to expect. A few days before our newbies’ first day, we send them an email with practical information on what to expect, such as details on when to arrive (10am in Sydney), what they might want to wear (jeans and a T-shirt, or whatever they feel most comfortable in), and who to ask for. We find this extra information makes walking through our front doors a little less scary on the first day. Arriving. When our newbies arrive, we ensure there’s someone there to greet them with a welcome drink while we set them up on our WiFi. We also encourage them to get to know the other new starters in their cohort before their first day activities start. Office tour and orientation. Canva has grown from being a single room office, to being across four levels, multiple buildings, and across oceans. So, before we show our newbies to their new desks, we take them on an office tour with the Vibe Team, followed by an orientation with Team Happiness where they are shown a little about what working at Canva is like, how teams are structured, important systems and tools to set up, and who to reach out to for further questions. Starter packs. All newbie desks are set-up with a new starter kit so there’s no need for newbies to go hunting for supplies. Standard items such a MacBook, keyboard, mouse, notebook and pens are accompanied with fun swag such as Canva stickers, a box of chocolates, and a helium balloon tied to their seats—providing a very unique first day experience designed to make the newbie feel extra special. “You can walk in the door empty handed and you’ve got everything you need to get started waiting for you at your desk,” says Linda Lin who is also part of Team Happiness. “We’ve all worked in places where we’ve just started, and we find ourselves sitting around well past lunch just to get our laptops sorted!” Relocation support. Canva is an international and diverse company. Many of our Canvanauts come from all over the world and we like to ensure that we’re making their relocation process as exciting and stress free as possible. At the end of their first week, we like to tee up some time to have a chat and ask how they’re settling into the company, and also into Sydney. We also provide a little pack of Australian goodies for them to enjoy, and organize regular social events for them and their families to meet new people. During their first two weeks at Canva, we schedule several onboarding workshops for our newbies across design, product, growth, engineering, people, culture, public relations, finance and legal. These presentations give newbies visibility and context on how decision-making is distributed throughout the team and company, and how each group works. We encourage our newbies to undergo these sessions together as a cohort, so they can bounce off learnings and observations with each other, and also be there to support one another—no one will understand their thoughts and feelings as much as the people who started on the same day. David Hearnden (R) running through Canva’s engineering architecture. Hearing from every team also reinforces Canva’s belief that onboarding is a company-wide responsibility. We are showing our newbies how each team works to achieve their goals, and how this fits with the overall Canva vision. These workshops are also centralized on our Canva team page for anyone who wants to revisit them on a later date. Team presentations stored on our Canva team page. Newbie, everyone. Everyone, newbie. Intros are an important part of familiarizing new people to the team but are also a great opportunity for the team to get to know a little bit more about our new recruits. We have several ways in which we introduce newbies into their new environments. Balloons. At Canva, we celebrate everything—a team member’s first day is no different. We like to make our newbies feel special with a big helium balloon tied to their desk. This makes it easier for newbies to find their desks and for others to know who and where the newbies are, so they can introduce themselves. We like to say that as long as someone’s newbie balloon is up, there are no silly questions. This gives them a bit of confidence if they are ever in a situation where they need to ask a question but feel like they shouldn’t. Welcome email. Using Enboarder, we send out a set of questions to all our newbies, the answers from which, are then turned into a little scripted ‘bio’ email that goes out to everyone at the company. The idea behind this is to quickly introduce newbies to the whole company, including those in different offices. Introductions. Newbies from the same cohort are invited to join forces to create a fun presentation using Canva for our Friday Show and Tell meetings. These presentations are saved onto our Canva team page, so people can go back and view them for direction, a reminder of something, or just a good laugh—often they include hilarious photos and interesting stories about our team members. Introductory presentations are a modern, inclusive way to get everyone involved, and they’re also a great way for newbies to use Canva at work! Newbie presentations stored in Canva. Meeting the founders. There’s no better way to engage our newbies than by showing them how important they are to us. Every newbie is invited to meet with our three cofounders. Melanie and Cliff, our CEO and COO, walk them through Canva’s history, current goals, product roadmap, and everything we want to achieve in the future, while Cameron, our CPO takes them out for some casual conversation over gelato and give newbies a chance to learn more about our product and design process. These chilled, informal meetings are often a favorite among our newbies because it gives them a strong sense of being part of something bigger, connects them to our goals, and grounds them to our mission. Some of our recent Manila newbies meeting with our cofounders for an update on our business growth. A newbie’s first day can be extremely nerve-wracking. Setting them up with a mentor can help ease their stress and give them the confidence to ask questions—no matter how big or small they may be—such as something as simple as where can I find X, or how do I go about X so I can achieve Y. Mentors also help newbies adjust to our company culture quickly and in turn sets them up to be a valued member of the team. Some of our mentor duties: Mentors are expected to spend about 20–30% of their time on these duties. On top of meetings and workshops, we like to jumpstart relationships to help newbies integrate into the company effortlessly. Leaving time for opportunities of casual conversation are a great way to induct new team members to our company culture. Lunch. Chef-cooked lunches where we eat together and catch up on work, goals and hobbies/interests outside of work. Some of the Canva team eating lunch together. Coffee dates. Three scheduled coffee dates in the first week with different Canvanauts who have been here for some time and can show them the ropes. Gives newbies a chance to learn about others’ backgrounds and roles within the company, and a little more about who they are outside of work. An example of a newbie’s invite to their first three coffee dates. We advise our mentors to reach out to their mentees before they start so they can get better acquainted. This could be done over Friday night drinks or a club event, so they can break the ice before day one. We always make sure to stress this is optional because we’re just as happy to meet them in person on day one. On their first day, teams will take a newbie out for coffee or lunch, so they get to meet everyone in a casual setting. We find this to be the most relaxing way to get to know the new person and the team, personally and professionally. According to research it’s more likely for new starters to actively search for a new job within their first six months when they have a poor onboarding experience and companies with an engaging onboarding program are able to retain almost all of their first-year workers.\nAt Canva, we want to make sure our retention rate is 100% and that’s why we know that onboarding takes time and is an ongoing effort. It is important for us to make our employees feel constantly valued, supported, and challenged—even after their first two weeks. Passing on their knowledge about Canva by guiding our newbies isn’t a task that ends in a fortnight. We expect our mentors to consistently give feedback on how their mentees are doing, be approachable, answer any and every question, support their mentee to join clubs and get involved, live Canva’s values and generally always be there for them. Some of our ongoing mentor responsibilities include: Surveys are a great way for us to collect feedback along the way from newbies. During week one and two, we use the information collected through these surveys to address any potential challenges or red flags, and to make sure a newbie is getting the support they need. We also use this as an opportunity to check-in with their mentor too—to see how they are going with the program. A week one check in email sent to our newbies. Our 360 process—run through CultureAmp —is a way for newbies to reflect on their time at Canva and obtain constructive feedback from the people they work with closely. This process complements the regular and immediate feedback they receive from their mentor from day one. As part of this, newbies complete a self-review. This is an important step in helping everyone identify blind spots and differences between their perception of their strengths and areas of improvement, against the perceptions of their reviewers. Once all feedback has been submitted, mentors schedule a 1:1 catch up with their mentee. An example of a 360 feedback email. Four to six weeks after our newbies start, we organize a one-on-one catch up with either myself or someone else from Team Happiness. This half-hour session is designed to allow us to identify how we can improve the Canva onboarding experience, which we share with our cofounders and Specialty Leads. I also share positive feedback with mentors or anyone the newbie highlights during this chat and use this opportunity as a touchpoint to follow up on any poor feedback from the week one, week two and month one feedback forms that newbies fill out. Here’s an example of one of my recent chats: An example of one of my Team Happiness catch-ups. Like all first impressions, we want to get it right from the start—so that everyone can reap the full rewards. If we don’t, this may impact how someone new feels about Canva, which in turn may have a negative effect on their productivity levels and how they make decisions at work. While it’s not a simple one-off task, we believe that the time and effort required for a multi-step onboarding experience will pay off in the long run. Like everything at Canva, our onboarding program is a work in progress, and we will need to continue to review and update it as we grow to 500 people and beyond!", "date": "2018-06-14"},
{"website": "Canva", "title": "The designer's dilemma: Tips from Canva’s CPO on mastering focus and intentional work", "author": ["\nCameron Adams\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/focus-and-intentional-work/", "abstract": "As designers we are constantly being reminded that we need to be inclusive in our processes, that we should be earning a seat at the table, building out our design system, making best friends with engineers, delving into data, sprinting, sketching, prototyping, coding (not coding), testing, researching and writing. Then taking some ‘me’ time for inspiration and side projects too. Phew! I think that if you did everything that Medium articles recommend you do as a designer then you’d probably be working about 128 hours a week, meeting with 36 people a day, and facilitating 5 workshops every afternoon. Over the years, as Canva has scaled to millions of users and the design team has grown from just me to a truly international partnership of many skilled individuals, I’ve tried out a bunch of ways to focus effectively while working with product teams and help the designers around me to do that too. It’s often a tricky balance, one that you have to constantly tinker with depending on who you’re working with and the projects you’re working on. But there are some core things I’ve picked up that can help it all run much more smoothly, and I’d love to pass those onto you. The responsibilities of a product designer (particularly at Canva) are numerous, but in terms of providing focus I think there are three key areas that we can talk about and use to help shape the way we—as designers—spend our days and weeks. I’ll tackle each of these areas one by one and they are: As I see it, product design is sandwiched firmly between the initial phases of product management and the final stages of engineering, and as such it is the nexus between the two. It’s when you are that bridge, however, that you find yourself being pulled in every odd direction—you’ve got product ideas, data, and requests coming in as stakeholders grapple with the product that’s going to be built, and then you’ve got engineers to work with: making sure they’re heading in the right direction, implementing ideas as per the design vision, and iterating on changes that will improve it. Juggling so many elements is no easy task. I find that having techniques and strategies in place to deal with this variety of work can decrease the time stress that is put on us as designers. When working with the flood of information channeled to you by product managers and stakeholders it’s important that you have all the information upfront, getting everything out of their head and onto paper. Often you’ll find that a PM or stakeholder will come to you and say “hey we want to do this” but you don’t quite understand why. You’ll start designing anyway, and then two weeks later they’re saying, “I totally meant this other thing. Why are we doing that?” The reason this happens is because they didn’t fully explain what was in their head the first time—the real problems and the project objectives were not clearly identified. Although it can sometimes feel like you’re holding up the train by stepping back and clarifying the problem that we’re trying to solve, getting that information out of their heads is extremely important and can save you and your team a lot of time in the long run. As an added bonus, fully understanding the problem also helps you solve the root cause rather than the symptoms. It’s not your job to make what the PM tells you, it’s your job to solve a problem for your users. Getting input early from your engineering team is a really great idea as well. It can sometimes feel like you’re being more creative if you’re not constrained by technology choices, but just handing a bunch of designs off to an engineer without taking into consideration the technical challenges will always result in a worse product. Including engineers in brainstorming sessions, informally running ideas past them, and working with them to create documentation that’s actually useful in their process will ensure that features are implemented the right way the first time around, instead of wasting everyone’s time on several iterations of the same thing. Setting up a proper cadence for checking in on progress will help you catch things before they go off course, and prevent you from having to unwind a bunch of work that’s already been done, or worse: having to ship something that doesn’t do what’s needed. Working on these processes can save you time, leave you feeling a lot less stressed, and save you from working on unnecessary iterations. Ultimately, it’s about giving you time to focus on intentional work. No matter how often we repeat the mantra “sketch before pixels”, it’s always tempting to skip straight to Sketch (capital “S”). Sometimes that can be the right decision, often it’s not. You have to communicate in the way that’s appropriate for the stage that your project is at. This could mean that you’re writing stories to define the scenarios that you’re tackling, or it could mean you’re sitting down with a product owner to sketch and brainstorm during the kickoff to a project. Your communication medium should revolve around the idea that you’re trying to convey and the audience that you’re delivering it to. Sometimes the idea is messy and half formed, sometimes the audience is inexperienced and needs more visual cues to understand where you’re going. Utilise your full arsenal of talking, writing, sketching, whiteboarding, prototyping and finished art to get it done effectively. Just being reactive to other people’s demands can be frustrating and also mean you’re not thinking in a way that effectively lets you do your job—of designing a great product! If you don’t structure your work properly, it’s easy to get lost in the chaos of it all. Taking the time to think about the future of the product means that you’re not just responding to other people’s demands. It’s important to stay one step ahead of those demands by considering and prioritizing what’s on the horizon, and understanding what level of ‘time fidelity’ to work at—should this thing take two hours or two weeks? Working on something for two weeks and then finding out that it’s totally in the wrong direction is not a great use of your time. Using your time wisely and staying on the front foot will free up time in your calendar, giving you a chance to focus on what’s important. Design is a very social profession that lives and breathes contact with people—this means a lot of time and effort spent communicating with lots of different individuals. But we also can’t ignore the fact that design is also a craft that requires moments of intense focus and exploration. Finding time for focus in the hustle and bustle of start-ups and modern product development can be extremely challenging. If you don’t get to do enough of it then your product will suffer, the teams you work with will be getting sub-par solutions, and—most importantly—you just won’t be a happy, well-rested designer who’s doing the best work of their life. We all have very high standards for the quality of work that we put our names to, and when we can’t afford the time to do that work then it adversely affects the very core of who we are. As we are the bridges between lots of different groups, it is rare to find ourselves with six straight hours of time to design, so I find that it’s necessary to have as many processes in place as possible that enable me to take advantage of those crucial hours of desk time that pop up. Time management became a real focus for me at the start of 2018, and I’ve got some tips on techniques that have really paid off over the last few months. Here’s what I do to help work productively and take control of my time: Now, I’m sure you’ve read more than a handful of click-bait articles that tell you about how amazingly successful people schedule their weeks. I read them all for five years and still nothing stuck. It wasn’t until I got into crisis mode with my schedule that I decided to start taking some small steps towards reclaiming my time. There are a bunch of different ways in which you can bring more order to your week and different ones will work for different people. I use a combination of my notebook—because I really love crossing out a real, physical thing when I’ve finished it—and my native calendar app. You might prefer an all-in-one tool like Evernote or Wunderlist , but whatever you do, including your calendar as part of this process is vital. When I first started planning out my week I felt like it was entirely schedule resistant, and I just wouldn’t be able to stick to it. Don’t worry: sometimes things don’t run to schedule, and when you first start out with this you won’t have much discipline. But as you practice you’ll get better and better at mapping out your day and making sure that you can stick to it. An example of my calendar For me, collaborating with other people is one of the greatest things to do at Canva. We have so many smart, passionate people, and sitting down in front of a notepad with each of them always produces a better solution than what we started with. It’s important that you know when to have a meeting or not, and know how to make every meeting a productive use of your time. There’s plenty of good articles on meeting hygiene, but if you’d like a 5-second summary, here’s a good checklist of things you can think about when someone asks you to have a meeting: If you’re starting to reassess how your calendar works (after “Planning your week” from above) then bunching meetings together is a great idea, because that gives you empty blocks where you can schedule in some focused time. The tendency when someone asks “hey, can we have a meeting?” is to say “yes”. But if you’re in the middle of a great stretch of productive work, it’s better to take a quick look at your calendar and schedule the meeting into one of your gaps, or group it with another set of meetings. Then you’ll be in meeting mode and won’t disrupt some of that great flow you get in a productive work session. You should also think about whether a meeting is the best format for what you want to communicate. There are some things that require deeper thought, some things that are not urgent, and some things just can’t be explained by typing. Knowing which is which is an important skill. Writing something up in a document and sharing it can be a better first step than getting a bunch of busy people in a room, and will also allow them to think more deeply about the problem and give their own considered feedback. Conversely: sometimes docs, emails and Slack can devolve into a confusing mass of tangled discussions and a meeting can help get everyone aligned and heading in the same direction. Being quick to respond on Slack, email, and a chat at my desk was a point of pride because my teammates could rely on me to be the oracle for their problems. However, it becomes amazingly addictive living like this. You get a buzz from each solution that you provide as the things you’d planned to get done are invisibly receding into the background. While you want to be the person with the solution to everyone’s problems, I find that turning off notifications on everything—emails, Slack, Facebook—and instead making time to check and respond to them at certain points in the day is the best way to stay focused and on track. Many of us often find ourselves wondering what our role actually is. What is a product designer? What do we bring to the table? Is it design? Research? Management? Is the role defined in the same way by everyone? At Canva, I find that our product designers take on many roles and that product design is many and all of these aspects. Our best product designers are the ones that create the best products, and in order to do that effectively they have to be able to weave in and out of these roles effectively. Being able to call on those skills at the right time, and understanding where the project is and what it needs most right now is incredibly important. Here’s some tips that will help you speed up your process as you wear each of the different ‘product designer’ hats: Focus is at the heart of being a great designer. It will help you work more productively, come up with better ideas, and collaborate more effectively with the people around you. Sometimes those moments of focus seem like a rarity in today’s work environment, but I’ve found that by taking the reins of your time and intentionally mapping out the work that you’re doing, it gives you a positive way to enact change in your work life.\nBy employing both good time management and thinking more strategically about the bigger picture we can ease our stresses, increase our work quality, and ultimately become much happier people!", "date": "2018-05-31"},

From our humble beginnings launching from a small office in Sydney Australia, today Canva is available across 190 countries in 100 languages—and we’re only 1% of the way through what we want to accomplish. I joined Canva to look after international growth and localization. Back then, we were only available in English. My goal was to launch in our first non-English language, Spanish. Our small international team set out to figure out what it would take. Canva today is available in more than 100 languages. Throw in a bunch of time zones, language barriers, cultural nuances, and you’re really in for a challenge. Ensuring a ship of this size sails smoothly and efficiently has taken some time, and a lot of learning along the way. Some of Canva’s internationalization team.

It’s 2016. We’re a small team sitting around a table. Got a question or want to find out what someone’s working on? All you had to do was tap the shoulder of someone next to you.\nIt’s 2018. We’re a global team that fill up tables, rooms, floors, offices, and buildings.

Within our team, there’s a few tactics we use to ensure that everyone gets the same context, whether they’re sitting with me here in Sydney, or set up in co-working space in Mexico. We use different communication methods for different outcomes, ensuring that timezones and instantaneous availability wouldn’t become barriers for us when it comes to achieving our goals. Here are some communication methods that worked for us, and are useful when working with global teams: Our company Jigsaw has existed from the beginning of time. An intensely extravagant spreadsheet, the Jigsaw is a set-up of all our teams and helps us manage our major projects while being able to track everyone’s goals for the quarter.\nIt’s a great way to bring everyone together towards our big picture goals and show how every team’s work supports that mission.

Aside from having a Slack channel for every interest and club under the sun, our Slack groups make working collaboratively on global projects much easier.\nOur Slack groups provide us with a constant and flowing forum between our in-country local teams, engineers, and localization teams, to give us visibility —in a matter of a few short messages—into our progress, ensuring that miscommunication and time restraints won’t hinder our ability to meet our goals and achieve milestones. While our ‘i18n’—internationalization—channel discusses any engineering issues related to the internationalization of Canva, our ‘LQA’—Localization Quality Assurance—channels are used as a company-wide platform where the multicultural team at Canva contribute their knowledge of speaking other languages to flag any incidental issues or opinions about translations. Some of our Slack channels. Click image to enlarge. Our ‘kudos’ channel is also used throughout the company so that our team members can continuously give credit where it’s due. Our ‘kudos’ channel on Slack. Click image to enlarge. When team members are far away it is important that we set a time that suits everyone to have a quick face-to-face conference call. We have an option of using either Skype, Google Hangouts, GoToMeetings, or Slack video calling to share what we’ve been working on, talk about what we’ve each achieved, what our upcoming priorities are, and to make sure we’re all on the same page. The first few days really set the tone for a new hire. We want to make sure our newbies leave the office feeling excited and supported. New team members are: Some of our onboarding presentations on Canva. Click image to enlarge. Our remote Canva teams also get onboarding workshops through Canva presentations from different members of the team. Our remote team onboarding welcome presentation in Canva. Building a product like Canva takes an incredibly talented team of engineers, designers, product managers, growth marketers, and a kick-ass operations team. As such, it’s important for us to hire all the people we need, and ensure they’re supported, fed, and is given clarity over the company’s goals. Multiply this diverse mix of people from different backgrounds and it’s imperative we create a workplace where everyone feels valued. Here are some things that worked for us, and are worth implementing within your global teams: It’s important to us that all our teams at Canva identify with the global organization as much as they do with their local offices. We believe that when our team members feel a sense of belonging to the larger organization, they are more inclined to be open about their individual or team goals and values. Organizational identification promotes: Our six company values guide all of our decisions about how we interact with each other and the world and help us in achieving our global goals. Our Canva company values. It’s not often that we all find ourselves in the same room at the same time. However, every so often we like to fly our in-country teams, remote teams, and Manila team members to our HQ in Sydney (or vice versa) to attend (company-wide) planning days such as our Season Openers or planning bootcamps. These opportunities give everyone at Canva the opportunity to meet, and have a great time together—usually over one of our famous lunches or our all out celebrations. It also give teams the opportunity to sit in the same room and talk about projects they are working on, upcoming goals, and any blockers they find that are hindering their abilities. We want to leave everyone feeling passionate, empowered, and part of a big community. As part of our onboarding program we ask that all newbies create a little presentation about themselves using Canva which they then present to the whole company during Friday stand-ups. This approach at avoiding cookie-cutter employee bios allows others to find out more about their co-workers’ interests, and means that our global teams and remote teams can take part too! Every Canva employee bio is stored on the Canva Team page so anyone can revisit these fun little presentations anytime. Jose’s introduction presentation made with Canva. In March 2016, the Canva team went on an incredible adventure to the Philippines as an opportunity to spend time together as a team. After a fun-filled trip to the beautiful islands of El Nido, the international teams all worked together from the Manila offices for a week. With multiple offices and remote teams in shared spaces across the globe it was a rare opportunity to get the whole team together; sharing their best practices, standardising processes, and learning from one another. The best part of the trip was getting to know everyone well and building strong bonds so that we can all keep working together smoothly and efficiently. If an international trip seems like a bit of a distant dream why not try simple ways of bonding such as just going for a team coffee after lunch, or a night out for a fun team activity followed by dinner. The team celebrating Blathnaid’s birthday. With a team as globally scattered as ours, streamlining processes and procedures greatly improves the efficiency of our work. Well-tested steps optimize the way our international teams work, guarantee we have fewer errors or delays in our work, duplication of effort is kept to a minimum, and our Canva teams and users feel satisfied. Here are some key things that worked for us, that might be useful for you: We realized early on that having people grouped into teams where they didn’t share the same goals wasn’t effective. In 2015, we moved towards the current inverted pyramid teams structure which has allowed us to align on our goals and objectives. Each small self-contained team has their own goal and the skills and expertise within that team to achieve them. This model empowers each little ‘start-up’ team and gives them everything they need to make decisions to be able to move quickly. An example of how our teams are structured. All our in-country local teams are small in size,self-sufficient, and have the necessary support with which to achieve their quarterly goals and make decisions quickly.\nLocal teams are also provided the company playbook, and ample support from specialty leaders, project coordinators, and an efficient operations team in Manila. When your teams are scattered geographically across the globe like ours are, it is important that every individual feels empowered and trusted to make decisions. Our team structures and ‘run with what you know’ attitude guarantees we keep moving forward quickly and achieving our seasonal goals without having to wait for someone else to sign off on something, or say yes or no. While we do have an organizational culture where everyone is kept in the loop, it is just as necessary for our remote teams and local teams to be able to have the freedom and creativity to make decisions on their own. Leveraging the right tools is important when you work with so many languages and have a weekly cycle of production. As a result, a majority of our workload ends up being large amounts of connection and communication to keep on top of everyone in the team, ensuring work is complete and error-free etc. This is why we use Smarling .\n, a Translation Management System (TMS), which acts as a repository for all our translations and provides our translators with a work interface, via its Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) tool. Translation Memory (TM) allows us to reuse previous translations, either partially or fully, through a feature called ‘smart matching’. When presented with a new string,smart matching compares an English source string to existing entries in the TM, and determines how closely related the two strings are. An example of how this works: If we get the string Search for help. translated into French, it will be stored in our TM as Rechercher l'aide . If we get this string again in exactly the same context, it is automatically populated by the TM, or fully smart-matched. This means we save our translators from re-doing work that was already done. If we get this string again, but in a different context, like in another part of the app, we utilize the existing translation in the TM, but we ask the translator to double-check so that it is appropriate in its new context. If we get a string like ‘Search for help, tips and features.’, we can leverage the entry in our TM for ‘Search for help.’ so the translator now only needs to translate the second part of the sentence, which makes the process more efficient and consistent. This is called “fuzzy matching”, and allows us to save time and resources. An example of how Smartling works. Click image to enlarge. To make every catch-up session counts, we encourage remote teams, translators, and international teams to send through or collaborate on weekly work summary spreadsheets. This allows us to: Working hard and setting crazy big goals are common practices at Canva. But as a fast-growing company, having treats along the way is a crucial ingredient to our success.\nAt Canva, we stray away from boring celebrations and like to go big! To celebrate reaching 100 languages we painted a mural of the word ‘creative’ in different languages across our new office wall and drove a food truck into the ground floor of the building. Some of our team celebrations from left: A tomatina festival to celebrate our Spanish launch; A multilingual mural to celebrate reaching 100 languages; Dress up as Steve Jobs day to celebrate launching our iOS app; A sumo match to celebrate launching in Japan; A holi festival to celebrate launching our Color Wiki; A Coachella celebration in Manila to celebrate the end of another season(quater). Something worth being conscious of when growing and working with an international team are the various perspectives and cultures that everyone brings to the table.\nFriendliness in one culture may not always be warranted in another; whereas humor in one language may not always translate.\nIt is important that we all learn to adapt, be aware, and respect each and every person we work with. Heres some things to keep in mind when working with global teams: At Canva, we constantly remind ourselves that while English may be one of the most universally used and commonly spoken languages, it is just another language. With Canva now available worldwide in 99 other languages, it is important to remove our company from an anglocentric way of thinking so that we are able to encompass the diverse societies that make up not only our Canva teams, but the world we live in. Examples of international templates made in Canva. Building a diverse and inclusive company goes hand in hand with building a successful company. In fact, it’s one of our core values: ‘Being a force for good’—making the world a better place through positive actions, inclusion, and diversity. Here’s some achievements we’re proud of: While being respectful and professional with everyone you work with goes without saying, it’s just as important when working globally to be extremely culturally aware. Be conscious of public holidays and religious celebrations that may mean teams in other regions are off work or unable to respond.It’s important to address this by giving them time outside of work or writing them a quick email to acknowledge the event. Examples of international holiday celebration templates made in Canva. Something else to be conscious of is the fact some co-workers are in regions where they may have slower internet connections making video conferencing more difficult. Patience in such situations is always just as important as awareness. In this increasingly technological world, having team members all over the globe is not only common practice, but necessary for companies such as our own. We also know that opening the doors for communication helps break down cultural barriers and encourages people to be kind to each other, so we’re hoping the lessons we’ve learned help us all strengthen our connections—and more importantly, make everyone feel they belong, just the way they are. We don’t want Canva to be a company that just makes designs that look good, but one that helps shape a brighter future for everyone.", "date": "2018-05-14"},
{"website": "Canva", "title": "How and why we do Team Health Checks at Canva", "author": ["\nYani Hornilla\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/team-health-checks-model/", "abstract": "There is little in this world that is achieved through the greatness of one single individual—putting man on the moon was a team effort, building the Burj Khalifa was a team effort, winning the world cup is a team effort. Scaling a successful startup like Canva is no different. Luckily we were able to discover the secret sauce to our success early on—the incredibly passionate and talented team that makes up Canva. Some of the Canva Manila team As the company grows tenfold, we want to make sure that everyone continues to be empowered to do their best work, and is part of a happy and effective team. As a matter of fact, I’m part of Team Happiness—where our main objective is to look after the incredible teams that make up Canva. Some of the Team Happiness team Something we’ve found essential in multiplying self-contained teams—those that have the necessary people and resources to achieve their goals—is having regular Health Checks, which gives everyone the opportunity to track their effectiveness as a team. In this article I will run through our Health Check process, and how we use this to address any underlying issues hidden behind the complexities of a fast-growing company. Some of the Canva Sydney team Most of our wins came about by brainstorming crazy big goals together, running experiments, shipping MVPs and incrementally hacking from there. However, we learned that to be able to keep up Canva’s momentum, we needed to give more TLC to the teams tirelessly working towards the goals! We’ve grown from a small team of five who set up shop in our CEO Melanie’s mom’s basement, to a company with over 250 employees spread across 70 teams around the world—who act like ‘little startups’. But while we’ve definitely experienced huge wins, it wasn’t always smooth sailing. With our rapid growth came the side effects brought on by having a more diversified team (which is a good thing! - but as you can imagine, with more people we needed to place more care to, help balance personal preferences and team dynamics). And then there were the challenges faced with working with remote teams, managing internal communications, juggling individual priorities - just to name a few. We also encountered difficulties around increasing cross-team dependencies, which slowed down the progress of some teams. It was then we realised we needed to find a way to support teams to become more effective, autonomous, and agile. Our teams are like little startups who have their own big goals, and are accountable and autonomous pushing their parts of the pie to hit Canva’s big goals. Inspired initially by Atlassian’s approach with its Team Health Monitors (and after a few chats with the awesome Dominic Price ), we decided to spend a bit more time understanding the key ingredients that make up successful and healthy teams in Canva. Through the results of our internal culture survey, using Culture Amp , and feedback from different people across various teams, we were able to identify the different checkpoints that make a team effective; and we used this info to create our very own Health Check process. Goals of the Team Health Check Furthermore, we needed to make sure that the whole company understood the value of these Health Checks, so that they will be willing and eager participants of the process. Afterall, the process only works if everyone plays their part. We have identified five checkpoints of a healthy team. These are grounded on our values which focus on empowerment, pursuing excellence, setting goals, simplifying things, and being good humans. The checkpoints are used universally in Canva, regardless of what team you’re on, which country you’re in, and who’s in the team. We’ve formed the habit of setting ambitious goals per team every season (quarter). This ensures that teams are focusing their time and energy on things that add value, create impact, and are aligned with the company’s goals. This checkpoint also allows teams to think about their priorities, as sometimes it can be a challenge to focus with so many other pieces of the puzzle moving around. Some of the Canva Manila’s recruitement team with their seasonal goal. As with any growing company, team members may find themselves doing work far beyond their daily capacity. It is important to make sure everyone is equipped not only with the tools and resources they require—and that these are sorted, paid for etc.—but also they are hiring the right people to fill the necessary roles within our growing teams. It’s also crucial for teams to identify any dependencies from other teams and identify how this is affecting the progress to their goals. A team is a group of people with different specialties and skillsets working towards a common goal. In a team where each member may be working on different parts of a project, having the right processes in place is critical—completing strategy docs, having team catch-ups, providing feedback etc.—means that everyone in the team is aligned on exactly what they are building and/or working on, and what goals they are achieving. Creating a sense of psychological safety within the team is what we believe helps all of our teams get on the same page, and work well together. Individuals within teams that are ‘out of sync’ will often find they are wasting time, are less open to ideas and process, are less likely to own up to their mistakes, and in some extreme cases likely to leave the company. We encourage our teams to create a culture where everyone has trust and mutual respect for one another, feels comfortable being themselves, is encouraged to make mistakes with an established sense of accountability, ask lots of questions, be open about their anxieties, and be available for one another. Celebrations are a big part of who we are at Canva. We celebrate the big, the small, and everything in between. As a company we like to make sure that while we are in an environment where constant, consistent hard work goes without question, we all feel connected to one another and our team. Canva team Holi celebration For teams to hit their big goals, project expectations need to be communicated to all the players, and work should be designated and divided based on each person’s unique strengths and experience—no single individual has to be responsible for, or able to do everything. Clear, consistent communication makes these things apparent so that our deadlines are less stressful, seasonal goals are met or exceeded easily, there is reduced conflict, and everyone is working at a greater efficiency. We encourage all our teams at Canva to have regular check-ins or markers that help everyone keep things on track. Having the right meeting cadence sets the pace at which all parts of the team pull together fast enough to reach their goals. Teams that don’t meet often enough can fall out of alignment, weakening their communication, and disconnecting them from reaching their end goals together. Physical packs instead of online visuals or surveys are an empowering, and effective way in which everyone can proactively take part in the process. Each Health Check pack contains: Ingredients in the Team Health Check pack We let our teams be creative in how they would like to use the packs. Remote teams for instance, can opt to run their Health Check via video call and use a digital version of the pack—like this one on Trello. A digital version of a team health check on Trello. Click here for the link. Draw up a mood scale on a whiteboard and get everyone to mark their position on it so that you all know how to frame that person’s feedback during the health check. It can be something simple like “on a scale of 1-10 how happy are you today?” or a little more creative like “from Deathstar to Dagobah, how are you feeling?” Our team was feeling extra creative and whipped this mood board up in Canva. An example of a mood board created using Canva Individually, take ten minutes to consider the checkpoints and identify at least one thing that your team has done well and one thing that can be improved on for each of the checkpoint. Write your answers on the sticky notes, ideally one note per thought. Guide questions per checkpoint are available in the pack to help you unveil more feedback to help make the discussion more productive. Make sure that the space is quiet so everyone can focus on writing their thoughts down. When everyone’s done brainstorming, go around the room and let each person share their answers and notes from the brainstorm. Each person should take their turn to put up their notes on a board or wall for each of the checkpoint. Group all the strong points on one side and the improvement areas on the other. Once everyone has taken their turn, start grouping everyone’s answers into themes. The goal is to identify the top five themes for improvement that emerged during the Health Check. Grouping common themes that arise from a Team Health Check Tackle each theme for a couple of minutes and identify possible solutions for the problem. Focus the discussion on coming up with concrete action items that the team can work on to improve these areas. For example, if a common theme revolves around improving the team’s lack of communication, think of how you can revise your current processes, or even revisit the practicality of the tools you’ve been using. The action item can be as simple as setting up weekly team catch-ups every Monday, and prepping a team agenda beforehand. To ensure action items and solutions discussed are given attention, invite the team to agree on owners of each action. The person assigned to it will be accountable for the action item’s success and are encouraged to report back to the team in a month’s time. Take photos of all actions and owners and circulate them around the team’s Slack channel so you can all keep track of it even after the session. Here’s a sample from our team! And you’re done! Put all the materials back in the pack and stash them back into the shelf so other teams may use it next time. As a general rule—return it in the same way you found it! At Canva, we’re shipping things in an incredibly incremental way which sees us breaking our goals into small, ship-able pieces of work. With regular feedback on how we’re doing, both as a team and individually, we know what we need to do to get to our next milestone. We’d love for you to experience the benefits of doing a Team Health Check and become more comfortable with those you work closely with everyday. Print out the checklist and process of our Team Health Checks and get started today. Establish the rules of engagement, align expectations. Clarify what’s unclear. Stop the session from going off on tangents. Watch out for: Things you can say to steer the discussion back to course: Everyone has a say. Every voice is heard. Watch out for: For remote or distributed teams: Keep each other accountable.", "date": "2018-05-14"},
{"website": "Canva", "title": "5 ways having a shared design system has helped us ship our designs faster", "author": ["\nMatt Anderson\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/building-a-design-system/", "abstract": "As a product designer, have you ever been frustrated trying to find the correct asset to use? Or spent hours debating which color green to use with a colleague? Or needed to re-design a button to suit a specific need? This was pretty much where we were when we first launched Canva. As our team had no standard rules for design, we’d often need to spend time getting on the same page with each other. Sitting across a table from one another was the best way we could keep in sync and across each other’s work. Some of Canva’s design team As the size of the team increased and the complexity of the product grew, inefficiencies grew alongside them. Designers were creating slightly different interfaces for the same needs: versions of the same buttons, layouts of the same element, and interactions for the same flows. Engineers started seeing problems where the code wasn’t very modular— any quick changes took a lifetime to initiate. Not only did we spend a lot of time debating small design details because there weren’t any solid rules for our product, but these inconsistencies made the product less intuitive to use. The solution? A design system. One that equipped the product teams with a common visual language, sped up the design process, and built bridges between design and engineering that helped to bring our beautiful products to life. Our design system intended to serve a few key purposes: In this article I’ll talk about why creating a shared design system has boosted our organizational productivity—and how you can help your teams improve product quality while reducing your company’s ‘design debt’. Since Melanie—our CEO—first came up with the idea for Canva, our vision has been to integrate the design ecosystem into one page, unifying industries and making Canva accessible to everyone. The Canva editor Fitting all those pieces together and keeping things simple, however, is no mean feat! With an increasing number of designers and engineers working across the Canva platform, we realized we needed to set up a common ‘language’ to ensure that our users had an experience that was consistent and our teams weren’t duplicating their efforts.\nWith five years of work leading up to where we were, we set out to reassess our interface. Enter the interface audit: an exhaustive examination and collection of screenshots categorizing all the components that make up the Canva user interface. Keep in mind that the interface audit doesn’t have to capture every instance of a particular pattern but simply one instance of every unique pattern. Below are some examples of the categories we looked at. Alerts can be found throughout the product to give simple visual feedback to users on the status of their request. It’s important that people can interact with objects in their designs in consistent ways when they switch devices, for example when selecting objects. Image grids should have consistent styling in terms of image ratios, spacing and layout. Here are some interface categories that can be looked at: With all this powerful information in hand, it doesn’t take a designer to know that having 13 variations on the same button style isn’t a great idea. Having figured out the different pathways, interactions, and elements that made up Canva, we sat down and asked ourselves some important questions: Which patterns were we happy with? Which patterns did we want to get rid of? Which patterns could be merged together? The next steps were distilling patterns into canonical components before translating the patterns from this interface audit into an active pattern library. Building a holistic library of components meant more time on everyone’s hands and less time spent on quality assurance; repetitively used standardized components allowing our builds to be easier to implement. What was once something built by a small team of engineers is today a collaborative effort worked on by expanding teams of people. Having standardized components allows our designers to spend less time focused on style and more time developing a better user experience. And while over time—no matter how consistent or small-scale a team is—new solutions, styles, and efforts will arise causing experiences to diverge. Our goal at Canva is to ensure that at the end of the day we are creating a product that allows our users to have a coherent, consistent experience; no matter what device they’re using. Working across teams, platforms, and locales, it is important that our designers and engineers create work that is aligned with our existing patterns and styles. We use two primary tools to manage our design system: Storybook We use Storybook as a UI development environment for all our UI components. It allows us to develop interactively and visualize different states of our UI components. Storybook also runs outside of our main app so we can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific requirements and dependencies. Sketch Using Sketch, our designers are able to access a component library, and easily turn our ideas into interactive prototypes. One of the things we struggled with early on was creating an easy way for all designers to access the same library. Fortunately, Sketch has introduced Sketch Libraries. We use these libraries that are version controlled using Git. We now use this by setting up shared Sketch libraries in a Google folder which designers sync with their desktops using the Google Drive app. When updating these design library files, everyone now has access to the most up-to-date content. Storybook is our single shared source of truth and is used as our living UI kit. Its where the exact components in all their different states, variations, and latest versions are stored. Over the past few months we’ve adopted React for all our components, and using Storybook means designers and engineers can interact with the components and toggle on and off their various states. Storybook also works alongside the libraries of components built to work within Sketch. Working across Storybook and Sketch our teams are able to design across all platform. Example of masonry states and variations in its latest version Example of icons in Storybook Example of icon components being implemented into a design in Sketch Working across both Storybook and Sketch makes it easier for us to do some cool things. Having a single source of truth—an up to date library of tried and tested components and patterns—such as Storybook improves our internal efficiency, through things like branch builds, and visual diffing. If an engineer is working on a particular feature, they can send designers a branch build. This private version of the feature can then be accessed by the designer to provide feedback and iterate on changes to components before they’re merged and sent to production. Branch builds on GitHub If we want to change what a button looks like we can check all the instances throughout the product where that button is used and can then quickly see if the changes have the desired outcome. Visual diff of search bar We are able to decrease avoidable back and forths and focus on experimentation, moving ideas quickly through their life-cycle so that we are able to better the visual consistency, accessibility, and experience our users have with Canva Regardless of whether we’re making UX changes to how our users collaborate on designs, or developing the style of our UI, our design system has reduced the overall organizational efforts from painfully long steps to a few simple clicks. An outline of our end to end process. Click to enlarge. The interdependent components of the design system mean that: Testing prototypes for our magic resizing tool. We’re moving towards a process where don’t need to use these ‘middle man’ Sketch procedures and as designers we can instead go to our engineers with a set of components from which they can implement and build the prototypes. Today, Canva is available across all devices—available on the web, iOS, and Android. While getting the design consistent across the board was the first piece of that puzzle, maintaining parity across devices is something that we are heavily focusing on. Using component-based development will enable us to speed up our programmers’ potential by reducing technical overhead and reusable code, hence, making it more efficient, and easier to scale. This will allow us to lower our efforts and increase the speed of our software development cycles—empowering teams to build better and bigger, products faster. The vision is to ensure a consistent user experience across every platform. We’ve been doing a lot of thinking from a design point of view, and are working towards unifying the experience. Example of cross-platform feature parity for Publish menu. Canva was fundamentally designed to work for all people; whatever their software, culture, language, physical, or mental ability. Because our product meets this goal, we can ensure that it is accessible to communities with a diverse range of sight, hearing, and cognitive abilities. Here’s two different ways in which we make sure that color is accessible on Canva: There’s a bunch of different types of color blindness, some of which affect a huge portion of the population. A common one is issues telling the difference between green and red. We have tooling that lets us check colour contrast and colour blindness types. The affordances have been distinguishing between which of our colors we can use in certain cases. e.g. text has a restricted colour palette which is baked into the components so we can ensure they have enough readability etc. Tests make sure we don’t rely on just color to indicate errors and the like. Testing colors for accessibility within the Editor We aim to meet WCAG 2.0 AA levels for color contrast. Basically, what that means is that there’s enough contrast between text and the background behind the text, for example light grey text on a white background is too low contrast to be able to be read easily. Employing our design system allows us to effortlessly create these accessible practices which in turn improve the usability of Canva; making it easier to look at, communicate, interact with, and navigate—improving the completion rate of designs and minimizing user errors and complaints. Canva is now in over 100 languages around the world! There are a lot of different considerations we have to take into account for all of these languages and cater to our international user database. There’s nothing more important than successful communication in a team. If you’re able to use the same naming conventions and language as the engineers you’ll find that making iterations and shipping products is a much more efficient process. So when’s the best time to establish your design system? The short answer is now. Design systems and their pattern libraries can often be created in conjunction with redesigning projects, replatforming efforts, and other company wide initiatives. However, this can be a massive undertaking involving many teams. So maybe the first steps might just be making a change in your design team, and unifying your designers with a Sketch library. If you don’t have the luxury of starting from scratch like we did, start with something specific. One month you may choose to work on colors; go through the whole process for colors, then the next month you may go through your icons. Very quickly you start to make decent headway. You may be looking at what we’ve done here at Canva and think that this isn’t appropriate to your needs. Something to always remember is that there is no one size fits all solution; spend a bit of time figuring out what the purpose of your product or company is before you apply these learning to your system.\nAlways update\nA design system grows with you. The process of developing and further refining a system is maintained over time—and it’s a never ending process. For it to stay relevant to your organization, a design system needs to consistently reflect all of the changing purposes of the product and the needs of the people using it. How effective a design system is can be measured by how well its different parts work in collaboration to allow us to achieve the purpose of our product.\nHaving a maintainable, reliable, flexible, scalable, strong, and successful design system has allowed Canva to consistently and efficiently satisfy the needs of our users.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Alpha Blending and WebGL", "author": ["\nDavid Guan\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/WebGL-David-Guan/", "abstract": "Canva filters, created with WebGL This article introduces alpha blending and some tips relating to the alpha channel in WebGL development. At Canva we use WebGL to provide image filters , similar to Instagram filters. While trying to fix a bug in Canva’s image filters, I discovered that it was actually due to a WebGL alpha blending bug in Chrome, and decided the topic was worth writing an article about. I’ll discuss the bug in depth later on, but first a short primer. Everything you see in the browser comes from pixels represented by an RGB value (or HSV, HSB, etc.) For the two squares below, if I uncomment the transform: translateX(-200px); a new “merged” square will be generated. What will the colour of that square roughly be as an RGB value? (Why would we even care what the value is? Well if we need transforming raw RGB data between client and server, paint the rendering result from <Canvas /> to <img /> or process images, then the value matters.) The answer is RGB(230, 25, 48), although it is possible that the value could differ depending on your environment. To figure out what happened, let’s start from the first square: This square initially has colour RGB(255, 26, 26), which comes from blending the page’s background RGB(255, 255, 255) with the square’s colour. Let’s call the first square SRC and page background DST.\nThe result value for the R channel is generated by SRC.R * SRC.Opacity + DST.R * (1 — SRC.Opacity) , and likewise for the B and G channels. When Opacity is 1, the result purely comes from SRC, and vice versa.\nSo we arrive at the result of RGB(255, 26, 26) by calculating: R: 255 * 0.9 + 255 * 0.1 G: 0 * 0.9 + 255 * 0.1 B: 0 * 0.9 + 255 * 0.1 Back to the final result of RGB(230, 25, 48) - we arrive there by blending SRC, RGB(0, 0, 255) opacity 0.1, with DST, RGB(255, 26, 26) like this: (0 * 0.1 + 255 * 0.9, 25 * 0.1 + 26 * 0.1, 255 * 0.1 + 26 * 0.9) In conclusion: as mentioned in the W3C CSS specification , opacity indicates how to blend the target with existing content, and browsers help us deal with alpha blending automatically. Opacity can be thought of as a postprocessing operation. Conceptually, after the element (including its descendants) is rendered into an RGBA offscreen image, the opacity setting specifies how to blend the offscreen rendering into the current composite rendering. Firstly, why use WebGL? As I’ve mentioned, at Canva we use it to provide image filters, and it’s also famous for powering 3D content on the web. Apart from these two use cases, this article has more information about everything it can do for you. Now, let’s take a look at two cases when alpha needs to be taken into consideration with WebGL: How WebGL content blends with other existing DOM elements on a web page How elements inside WebGL content blend with each other (two shapes again, for example, but drawn with WebGL). The Codepen below draws a triangle with colour RGB(0, 0, 255), opacity 0.3: See the Pen WebGL alpha blending 1 by David Guan ( @davidguan ) on CodePen . As you can see, the triangle painted by WebGL is blended with the webpage’s background. Its colour is RGB(179, 0, 255). Based on what we learned previously, the 179 comes from 255* 0.7, but why isn’t the 255 value closer to 255 * 0.3? The 255 comes from WebGL’s default behavior — premultiply alpha. Instead of SRC.B * SRC.A + DST.B(1 - SRC.A), browsers will treat the “* SRC.A” part as already done by the WebGL rendering pipeline, so we have 255 + 0 * 0.7. One way to solve this issue is changing the WebGL configuration: Now it works as expected. Unfortunately we can’t solve the problem this way, because alpha blending is not correctly handled in Chrome when premultipliedAlpha is disabled. You can find more details here in this Stack Overflow question I asked and this Chrome bug ticket . Instead, we can manually multiply alpha or use WebGL’s blendFunc (more on that later). Let’s remove the premultipliedAlpha: false and add gl_FragColor.rgb *= gl_FragColor.a; at the end of fragment shader. The result is same as the previous image and now it also works in Chrome. Now, let’s think about rendering two shapes, one above another (as we did previously). The codepen below draws two half transparent triangles at the same position with colours RGB(255, 0, 0) and RGB(0, 0, 255): See the Pen WebGL alpha blending 2 by David Guan ( @davidguan ) on CodePen . I’ve made the page background RGB(0, 0, 0) so we can focus on the content generated by WebGL. It turns out the value of R is 0. The reason behind this result is that WebGL does not provide alpha blending by default. We can enable the normal alpha blending by inserting the code below before rendering: One bonus we get by making this change is that we can remove the gl_FragColor.rgb *= gl_FragColor.a; in the fragment shader since its job is done by gl.SRC_ALPHA . If you don’t want to change the shader, change gl.SRC_ALPHA to gl.ONE . You can read more about blendFunc and other ways to blend content here . That’s all, thanks for your time.

What do thirty students learn on a tour of Canva? Office tour with Stan Domeshok and Vivien Fu This week we received a visit from UNSW CSE Society, who heard talks by Canva speakers, did an office tour, asked questions and enjoyed some of Canva’s famous fried chicken. Canva speakers gave students a practical overview of some of the engineering areas that students could go into. These included frontend development , mobile , product management , backend development and data science . We also tried to answer the question “What should I study at uni?” If you’re interested in the content of those talks, read on! If you want to hear some student impressions of the tour and the Canva vibe, skip down to the bottom. Chris Chen It’s a question people often ask. What subjects should I take if I want a code-focused role at a company like Canva? Chris had one concrete study suggestion: Concurrency (or anything non-deterministic). It turns out that concurrency is super common in the real world these days. Gone are the days of single processes running on giant mainframes. These days your code is operating in a weird, scary, nondeterministic environment with lots of other things happening at the same time. If you’re working on the frontend, you have to deal with asynchronous frameworks. If you’re doing native mobile dev, you have to think about work versus draw threads. If you’re working on the backend, you have to deal with concurrent requests and horizontal scaling. Concurrency is unintuitive and difficult. When things go wrong, you’ll get corruption of data or $60M re-entrancy bugs. Studying concurrency at university isn’t going to fully prepare you. But if you’re at least aware of the problems, you’re going to save yourself a lot of headaches. But apart from that, Chris had some feelgood advice too: “Take whatever you’re interested in. Most CompSci subjects have surprising practical applications! ” And she didn’t just mean “critical thinking” and “independent thought”. For example: Algorithms and data structures : “When does one start caring about the difference between O(n), O(n log n) and O(n 2 )? When you’ve got 10TB of data and users who hate latency” - traditional web company proverb. Networks, hardware and microprocessors : You never know when you’ll have to look under the hood of your “pretty abstractions”. Or maybe you just need to run cost assessments on investing into GPUs. Formal methods and security modelling : The ability to think of a problem in terms of worst cases, and being specific about what you want is incredibly important. This is true of everything from privacy and threat models, down to deciding what one API function really does. And the list goes on - machine learning, operating system design, programming language theory, or almost anything else come to think of it. Frontend Engineering at Scale by Nick Whyte (thanks to Brendan Annable for the original talk material) What is frontend engineering? How do you scale a frontend? The frontend is the thing that users get to interact with. Recently more and more logic that used to be done on the backend is being done on the client side. That’s landed us in the era of single page applications. Single page applications show the user interface to the users, then respond to user events. This response potentially involves issuing an AJAX request to the backend. Canva has a very large frontend codebase, and that means a lot of scale issues. We need to be able to scale our engineering processes as we scale our codebase, and accommodate all the new engineers coming in. High quality code, modular code and testable code mean that things don’t break or become unmaintainable as the codebase grows. This is how we do it: Rigorous code review not only maintains quality, it’s a great teaching and learning tool. Code ownership , where each part of the codebase is owned by a certain engineer, also promotes code quality and distributes responsibilities. Type safety prevents a lot of the trivial mistakes that untyped JavaScript can cause. Canva’s frontend codebase is 100% typed, thanks to TypeScript and Closure Compiler. Continuous integration means that every commit runs a full build of the Canva website. Checking things like types and linting here helps pick up bugs that code review may have missed. Harness pages are pages that allow us to run lightweight ‘fake’ versions of our webpages during development (so for example we don’t have to navigate to a page 10 layers deep in the UI over and over again) This is also great for encapsulation and modularity, because it encourages pages to be built in isolation. Modular CSS - Using Block Element Modifier classes like “menuBar__item—selected” means we do away with nested CSS selectors, and means we can restructure HTML without changing the CSS. We’re moving towards CSS modules. Testable code using dependency injection allows us to inject fake instances of dependencies, ensuring our tests are well isolated and only test the bare minimum. Finally, mentoring ensures we can scale as an engineering team. Every new hire is assigned a mentor, who helps them get up to speed quickly when they join. We do fortnightly frontend forums, monthly engineering all-hands and of course review every line of code. Nick Whyte, frontend engineer on the Experiments team. “You don’t stop learning when you leave university - ideally, your pace of learning only increases!” CSESOC - Product Management by shipram What can you do with a CS degree other than write code? Have you considered getting into product management in the future? Shipra Mahindra, product manager for Canva’s mobile apps, talked about the role of product management in a startup. Shipra started her career as a software engineer herself and worked her way into product management, with an MBA at UNSW on the way. A product manager works at the intersection of business, tech and UX. We work to deliver the highest business value possible by creating new products or iterating on old ones. We also need to work out what our customers want, and deliver customer value by making sure our products have a great user experience. We need to talk to customers and do user research. We need to work with engineers to solve problems everyday, so a technical background really helps for understanding what can be built within a timeframe. Shipra Mahindra Shipra talked about product management in Startup versus established businesses. It’s important to be a servant leader. Your title may have the word “manager” in it, but you’re not really managing anyone. You’re managing the product! You don’t have direct influence over people. Engineers have an engineering manager, designers have a design manager and so on. So you can’t tell people what to do, it’s about influencing people, discussing the issues and getting buy-in. You need to show with examples and data. Most PM’s I’ve met never set out to be product managers, that’s just the way their career progressed. A technical background really helps, but PMs also come from other backgrounds like marketing. How can I prepare for product management at uni? At uni the things you should pay attention to from a Product Management perspective are knowing how the software lifecycle works, things like how different software architectures work and how tech stacks are put together. All the big picture things. You need to be a bit business savvy as well, so if you can grab an intro to marketing, finance, HR or other business functions that’s great too. Canva Mobile by Nic Wittison Nic talked about Canva’s mobile journey and distilled some gems of wisdom he learnt along the way. These are the takeaways: At the start of a project, iteration speed is more valuable than having amazing code. If your product changes really quickly, having technically amazing code doesn’t matter if you just have to rewrite it anyway. The important part is making your code easy to refactor or separate. If you’re going to spend time on making something technically good, at least make sure you can reuse it somewhere else! You always have to make compromises. Learn to identify what really matters so you can make better choices. You can’t always do what you want. The APIs you want may not include everything you need, the timeframe might not be sufficient to do everything. It’s all about identifying the most important things for your project. Debugging code is twice as hard as writing code. If you write genius-level code, you need to be a double-genius to fix it. There’s so many times I’ve written code, gone back to it 12 months later and thought “Who wrote this? It’s nonsensical garbage!”. So write simple code, and make it straightforward to read. If it’s important to your app, try to write platform agnostic solutions to problems. If you can avoid tying yourself to technologies that only work on one platform, it’s going to be easier to move to other platforms later on. Nic Wittison Design your UI mobile first. If you design a really complex UI and then try to squish it onto a mobile screen, that’s a lot harder than starting with a small mobile feature set and expanding it. Use your demos to get feedback faster. Developers love showing off their apps to people. Do it more, and pay attention. If your mum gets frustrated with your app, that’s a bad sign. Take mental notes, or even real notes. Don’t underestimate the value of good communication. Learn how to communicate with different audiences. Practice it. If you’re talking to a designer, using words that are specific to the frameworks or languages you’re using won’t help. Learn to talk in higher level concepts, and you’ll get feedback faster. Automate chunks of process whenever you can. You can save a lot of time in the long run with simple optimisations. If you hate uploading the app to the app store, turn it into a script. Automate the smallest chunks possible - this makes your scripts maintainable, and you can string them together into more complex processes. Talk to the people at Apple and Google. There are developer relations teams, and some are based in Sydney. It’s their role to find good apps and promote them. Try to make at least one piece of demo tech. Make the kinds of things that people feel compelled to show others. An example is the augmented reality demo we recently built into the iOS app. It’s built using Apple’s ARKit, and it’s super fun to show around. You can use it to see how your designs will look printed in real space! What Data Scientists Really Do by tiny Tiny Pang, data scientist at Canva What is data science actually? Could this be your future job? Data science is a bit of a buzz word, but do you really know what it means? Data science actually covers a number of different fields. There’s product analytics , which is about measuring and analysing user behaviour on your product and using that information to improve the product. Then there’s data infrastructure , where you build data pipelines, choose the databases that store your data and run queries on it. You might pass that information on to product analysts, or do the analysis yourself. Finally there’s machine learning and AI , where you are algorithmically detecting patterns in large data sets. At Canva we track a lot of events on our pages (for a funny version of this, see clickclickclick.click ). For example we track an event called design_create which is triggered when a user creates a design. The event time, type and location within the product are linked to a user id, country, language and so on. As a data scientist, I need to think about how to we’re going to collect these events and choose the right kind of data pipeline to collect it. That will depend on a few things, like whether the data is going to be hot (frequently accessed) or cold (infrequently accessed). I have a choice of various technologies, including Amazon S3, MySQL and Redshift. After that we need to decide what kind of analysis to do. That could be as simple as a SQL query or as complex as a deep neural network. So there’s a lot of variety within data science, if you’d like to go down this path! Tiny Pang giving away her data about data science What studies would you recommend for getting into data science? I did my undergraduate degrees in pure mathematics and computer science, and I did my research degree in AI. I actually recommend a standard computer science degree, rather than a specific data science degree. Computer science fundamentals are really important for creating, manipulating and cleaning data sets, especially strange ones. What’s something you didn’t realise about data science when you started? I didn’t realise how important it is to be able to sell your ideas. Often when you tell someone some information that’s data driven, it’s going to go against their intuition. If you don’t sell your analysis well, people sometimes don’t even listen to the data! Brendan Humphreys fielding some questions Brendan gave students a brief overview of the backend of Canva and fielded questions. Brendan was one of the original four backend engineers at Canva, having started 3 1/2 years ago. On the backend we use a microservices architecture. The idea of a microservice is enforcing separation of concerns. That means identifying the entities in your system and building a single-responsibility service for each. We’ve used the microservices approach from the start, and its helped us scale both in the amount of traffic we can handle, and the number of engineers now working on the backend systems. Each service exposes a cohesive interface, and services communicate with each other using REST over HTTP. Sometimes when we judge a service has taken on too much responsibility, we split it into two or more smaller services. Today we are handling a ridiculous volume of traffic. Being a fast growing consumer application, we handle a lot of data from a very large user base - certainly more than the average large B2B application, for example. Our users upload more than 1.5 million image uploads every day, and create more than 14 designs every second. That means petabytes of media data on Amazon S3 and hundreds of gigabytes of design data in our MongoDb cluster. We also have a large Cassandra cluster (tracking comments on designs, likes, and followers), several large Solr clusters (media and design search), and many more traditional relational stores (e.g. for billing, profile and subscription data). The backend infrastructure consists of between 200-300 servers keeping the whole show going. What’s the interview process for the backend? Why is there a take home task? We find that the homework challenge is a good filter. We understand that is requires some time to answer, but generally the kinds of engineers we’re looking for are able to solve it without too many problems. Lots of people actually prefer being able to sit down in their own time with a challenge, rather than being made to stand in front of a whiteboard for hours. If you get past the challenge process, you come in for more interviews and are asked to modify your code from the challenge. It very much simulates the kind of work you’ll be doing day to day, which doesn’t involve balancing red-black trees. What we’re looking for in the challenge is “production ready” code, that’s written with a certain level of engineering maturity. That means taking into account edge cases, testability, maintainability, documentation, readability, performance and smart tradeoffs. We’re judging you as a potential peer . Taking a Canva-style lunch break I think Canva is one of the most dev friendly environments I have ever been in. The way the teams are organised on each floor with developers, product manager, and designers sitting across from each other was pretty cool to see. We even got to see the CEO sitting with a team. - Ainharan Subramaniam Overall, the tour of the Canva office was a fascinating experience. Seeing the creative workspaces and getting to hear from a few people on the Canva team gave incredible insight into what life is like at Canva for a software engineer. The general vibe about the office seemed chill and innovative, with a bit of hipster flair. - Alli Murray A really fun and relaxed atmosphere. Everyone seemed passionate about helping create such a cool and unique product. - Ray Zubair There were insightful presentations given by talented people who work there, they were passionate and enthusiastic during their talks. We were also toured around the office space briefly, the office decor is simple but not boring at all!

{"website": "Canva", "title": "My first month at Canva", "author": ["\nDavid Guan\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/first-month-at-Canva-David-Guan/", "abstract": "It’s been one month since I left China for the first time in my life. Back in Shanghai, I had been a long-time follower of former Apple Chief Evangelist Guy Kawasaki’s talks online. One day I heard he had joined a new startup called Canva, and not long after that I came across a job advert online. I decided to apply, and before I knew it I was boarding a plane for Sydney. I thought now would be a good time for me to write honestly about some things that surprised me during this month and how things are going now. Things that surprised me There are lots of things that didn’t surprise me at all. There’s a real startup environment and a great engineering culture here (I sensed that from the blog articles my current colleagues have published, and the tech talks they’ve given) and the product is one that I am personally interested in. There were also some nice surprises though! Mentor system My mentor Tristan helped me a lot in my first month. In fact, it was the best mentoring I’ve ever experienced in my career. Tristan provided me with some guidelines which weren’t covered by the training sessions, assigned me some newbie-friendly tasks and introduced me to other teams. Most importantly, he reviewed every PR I made since day one and provided lots of valuable feedback (thanks also to my teammates Albert and Patrick for this). Great build pipelines This was a nice surprise as well. Our engineering team provides lots of predefined build pipelines we can use to apply to the branches in our code repository. Not only can they be used for the mission critical branches’ CI, they can also be used to speed up code reviews and team interaction. For example in one of the build pipelines there is a “Deploy storybook” step, which will generate a React-storybook site link. Build pipeline For developers who need designers to check the UX or just make their work pixel-perfect, they can send the deployed storybook link, saving time on both sides. Coffee walks I was actually really surprised by how quickly I was able to fit in and adjust. During my first two days, I had several “coffee walks” with the Canva founders and my teammates. We had casual talks during these walks and had coffee together, which reduced my nervousness a lot. There are other experiences designed to help people get to know each other better, like Friday newbie introductions and having lunch together in Canva’s big canteen every day. Whether it’s by design or just because of all my friendly colleagues, Canva is really good at making new people feel part of the team. Fun and food People here not only work hard, they also have a lot of fun: Deciding our release names on Slack And the food here is above and beyond my expectations… Grilled mixed seafood with feta black olives and spicy watermelon salad #prawns #octopus #salmon #watermelon #foodforlove #spicy #fresh #summer #valentines #canvavibe @canva A post shared by Vibe at Canva (@canvavibe) on Feb 14, 2017 at 12:43am PST How things are going now When I started a month ago, I was questioning myself a lot. I was quite nervous about whether I could get the required work done. Fortunately overall, things are going really well. Daily work I finished some early tasks smoothly (80% of the tasks my mentor assigned to me were newbie-friendly), which gave me the confidence to take on harder tasks and dive into the codebase (although I still made some silly mistakes in my daily delivery). Engineers at Canva are very reasonable in code reviews, quick to respond to review requests and treat every line of the code very seriously. It would be tough to find a better place to develop your craft. In short, I’ve learned a lot in the first month and am very excited to deliver more with my team members. Getting used to work and life in a new country Haruki Murakami says in his book ‘What I Talk About When I Talk About Running’: To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important thing for long-term projects. Once you set the pace, the rest will follow. Every day after I finish my work around 6pm (I’ve only worked overtime a few times because of mistakes I made during the day!) I go to the gym for half an hour or to my yoga studio for a class. That’s my daily rhythm and it helps me pace myself between hours at the computer. Both gym and yoga are kindly paid for by Canva! Monday is my only exercise free day, because that’s when Canva’s movie club meets. Later I set aside some time to practice things like JavaScript and 3D application development. It’s a busy schedule, but I hope I can keep up the pace. About two months ago I started getting very interested in WebGL and even made a website, webgl-workshop.com . Thanks to that, my team assigned me some work related to WebGL filters which will start shortly.😛 So that’s it for now, it’s been a big change to get used to but it’s all gone surprisingly well so far.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "The turnaround of Canva’s iOS team", "author": ["\nDiana Mesanovic\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/ios-team-diversity/", "abstract": "Something I’ve been passionate about since starting in the recruitment industry more than seven years ago is building a diverse, inclusive and representative workforce. It’s something that’s continued here at Canva. While hiring for iOS at Canva, it became very clear to me that we needed to focus on bringing in people with different perspectives and backgrounds, given the impact this has on our users and the success of the company. Recently I’ve been given the opportunity to step into a new role with the mission to help build out the most diverse and inclusive engineering organisation in the world. We’re going to do that by ensuring our pipelines are filled with the highest quality candidates, especially those from underrepresented areas. The creation of this role demonstrates Canva’s true commitment to solving workforce challenges and positions us for long-term success. Pursuing diversity at Canva This focus really started for me after leading recruitment for our mobile teams. When we made our first female hire, there were seven male engineers to one female engineer in the iOS team. We thought hard about how we could make our new hire feel as included and comfortable as possible. Imagine consistently being in meetings where you are underrepresented - there are considerable challenges associated with that. Underrepresented groups often face challenges such as having the chance to speak and contribute in meetings, and knowing that their views are considered and respected. It is important to note - I am not saying that this has been a problem here, but it is an unconscious bias that underrepresented groups constantly experience. We saw gender diversity as the most critical area to be cognizant of at Canva. Although this is where we have started, we will continue to focus on a number of other underrepresented groups to ensure our workforce continues to empathize and build for our diverse user base. Where we’re at now On the mobile team, we’ve had some incredible success. 33% of the team are now female engineers. In fact 80%, or 4 out of 5 of our latest hires on iOS have been female engineers. As you can see there’s still room for improvement, but it’s something I’m very excited to be working on. Some members of the Canva mobile team How we tackled it on iOS At the beginning of this journey, I honestly didn’t think that solving this problem would be that difficult. In reality, I couldn’t have been more wrong. The team believed that we needed more diversity, but were singularly focused on making an amazing product rather than recruiting. Typically in engineering environments hiring is seen as the less attractive part of an engineer’s role and is often deprioritized in favor of delivering technical objectives. This is why solving a representation problem requires time, dedicated effort and improvements to many processes by a team of internal stakeholders. It needs to start with someone taking charge, and giving that challenge to a dedicated team like Talent Acquisition can be a good start. My first idea for an actionable solution was to headhunt female engineers across multiple channels and bring them into our process. Interestingly, I actually met Canva’s first female iOS Engineer at a mobile development meetup at the offices of another top Sydney technology company. The two of us were among the few females at the meetup so naturally we chatted, and I mentioned that she should come to work at Canva as our iOS team is amazing! It took about seven months to finally convince her to come in for a lunch with the team. My primary learning from this was: a lot of things you do now will pay off later. Here are some of the learnings so far Get data : I knew that Canva had to do a few things at the same time in order to get the diversity results we wanted as a company. The first step was analyzing our current recruitment process and figuring out what we could do better. Engineers love data and so do I, so this step was pretty simple in practice. I looked at our raw interview and hiring data and created a presentation with the improvements I thought we could make. Fix the interview process : Another key task in our diversity journey was helping the team members responsible for hiring at Canva improve the interview process. At Canva, interview decisions are distributed among a broad panel and engaging with all team members on this panel was crucial to improving our interview process. I asked the team to tell me what we were lacking. They acknowledged the obvious lack of diversity and that it needed to be fixed. We decided to remove unintentional barriers in our process that may have made it harder for some candidates to succeed. In addition to this, we noted that we needed to get more candidates through to the final stage of our process. To accomplish this, we decided to intentionally balance our pipeline without lowering our quality standards for any candidates. Ultimately, what had the greatest impact was just getting the conversation started in the team. Not only did we want diversity in our team because it was a good business decision, but because research has found that non-homogeneous teams are simply smarter, more innovative and make better and more informed decisions. Diversity improves overall company culture and success. Despite the obvious business reasons, diversity just makes the workplace a happier and friendlier place to be. Focus my time on balancing the pipeline: On a personal level, I decided to allocate my resourcing and interview capacity to increase the gender balance. Over the course of three months, we quadrupled the historic average of 10% interview opportunities for female engineers to over 40%. Work on representation goals with our recruitment agency partners: At Canva, all of our teams are growing significantly and we work with some external partners to help us bring in more candidates to the pipeline. I asked each of our external recruitment partners to help me diversify the pipeline with some awesome headhunted candidates. You can’t solve everything yourself, you need all the help you can get. Being direct with our partners about focusing sourcing efforts on key areas of importance to Canva proved hugely effective in securing a more representative group at the top of the funnel. Nothing groundbreaking - just focus As you can see, there’s nothing really groundbreaking in what I did. It’s a step by step process where following through with what you think works best, trying new things and getting people onboard with the vision is key. My advice to other companies who want to improve the lack of diversity in their teams would be to start small - start by improving your actions and that of your team. Ensure your team is educated on diversity issues, that they understand its benefits and are working on tangible solutions to the problem. It is very well known that many groups are underrepresented in the technology industry, so what specifically will you and your team do about it? There are so many things that can be done on so many levels - make sure you select the key areas you will spend your time and resources on in order to reap the greatest rewards. Finally, be persistent with your attention and create a goal for your team that you actually put on the agenda and prioritize. What we’re doing going forward We have started measuring the gender gap, and soon we will be looking at more than just gender. We also have a diversity committee that is working on a Diversity Roadmap. The goal of this group is to make Canva’s workforce more representative of our user base as well as the community we live in. Our initial focus will be on closing the gender gap, but our ideal future is representation for all groups whether it be age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and more. We are also supporting events that encourage women and young girls to enter technology, such as Node Girls , Women Who Code , Code Like A Girl and Curious Minds . Our People Team is making sure that Canva has the best employee policies for families, including flexible work arrangements and parental leave. Finally, it’s important for us to acknowledge that we don’t know everything, and are just at the beginning of the long journey to make Canva more representative. As we grow to hundreds and possibly thousands of team members in the coming years, we’ll need everyone’s help in building an inclusive workplace where every single person can feel like they belong.", "date": "2017-08-22"},

Canva flew Ryan out from Seattle to talk about TypeScript at our second Frontend Engineering Sydney event, held at the Canva office on May 31. He was joined by Sharon Kuo and Marc Fallows of Canva, as well as Chloe Chen of Data 61 (CSIRO), who all shared their experiences with typed JavaScript technologies. \"Helping to improve correctness and soundness of code.\" @SeaRyanC @typescriptlang #frontendsyd pic.twitter.com/s8xUcAE2qy Ryan opened the talks with some discussion about the goals and non-goals of TypeScript. Statically identifying constructs that are likely to be errors, like those above, was high on the list. “Statically” means “before your code runs”. We could have decided this differently, we could have said “What we’ll do is take Javascript and add code at runtime that checks to see if your types are correct”. But instead we said “Let’s do this statically, because we think that’s going to enable better tooling, and that’s going to drive those errors upstream rather than waiting until your code’s actually running.” We then did a deep dive with a fun JavaScript code review, featuring code by Ryan and his (possibly evil) twin Brian Kavanaugh. This was followed by a discussion of the concept of soundness (never having wrong types in your program), and how TypeScript can help you when your computer doesn’t believe that your web app works. Ryan continued with a detailed discussion of the tradeoffs TypeScript makes between soundness and working code. “Soundness and correctness are highly correlated” says Cavanaugh, but “we want to strike a balance between soundness and actual correctness and productivity.” Another of TypeScript’s goals is not to cause substantial breaking changes from TypeScript 1.0, and Ryan describes how new TypeScript versions balance the value of finding new bugs in users’ code against the horrors of “opening up your program and seeing like 300 warnings that weren’t there before”. Ryan describes examples of generic type inference as a simple breaking change that had to be made. Finally Ryan talks about the next steps for TypeScript, and how TypeScript picks the features they prioritize. “Improving the spectrum” of typedness options is a big priority. For users moving more towards types, TypeScript’s evolving flags like –strict aim to fill the gap, while the new checkJS flag released with 2.3 in April will help those with existing large JavaScript applications transition to types more smoothly.

Our main speaker will be Ryan Cavanaugh, one of the core contributors to TypeScript at Microsoft. Canva is flying Ryan out from Seattle to provide deep insights about the design, philosophy and future of TypeScript - the superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft to allow static typing and make it more maintainable and powerful for large-scale projects. Tickets are available here, while they last! We spoke with Ryan about his history, his current role and his passion for TypeScript. Ryan Cavanaugh What was the initial inspiration for TypeScript? As an evangelist for TypeScript, what is the main thing that excites you about it today? TypeScript started when it became apparent at Microsoft that we’d be writing many more large JavaScript applications in the future, but JS wasn’t well-suited for large-scale application development due to maintainability problems presented by a lack of static typing. TypeScript inspires me because it solves a real problem in a simple, elegant way. There’s nothing I love more than seeing someone on Twitter say something like “I was hesitant at first, but I’m never going back to JS after using TypeScript” – it means we’ve done our jobs right. @rob_rix I refuse to touch JavaScript after we started using TypeScript for https://t.co/Y96BtLqOYW What did you work on at Microsoft before TypeScript, and how did you get involved in TypeScript? Before working on TypeScript I worked on the internal tools we use in Visual Studio to automate testing VS, and before that on Visual Studio LightSwitch. After a reorg in my previous role, I decided it was time for a new job. I started learning JavaScript (because it was clearly about to overtake the world), and was continuously frustrated by silly runtime errors that could have been easily detected by a computer. This was peak CoffeeScript time but I realized that the problem with JS was its semantics, not its syntax! The next week I heard about this “Strada” (codename for TypeScript) project, got a demo from a PM on the team, and my first reaction was “This is exactly the thing I’ve been looking for. Are you hiring?” I joined the team in April 2012. What was your role in the development of TypeScript? What is your role now on the TypeScript team? My first task was to revamp the testing suite we use to keep TypeScript stable. Since then I’ve worked on all aspects of the language, most notably adding JSX/React support to the language, creating our automatic type acquisition (NPM @types) story, adding language service extensibility, and now working on adding refactoring support. As a developer on the team I’m responsible for general feature implementation and bug fixes. Additionally I maintain our GitHub process and am a primary triager of issues reported on our GitHub repo. As part of this work I drive decisions on community suggestions, provide language design and prioritization feedback, and try to engage with the community as much as I can. I also do some work on the Node Tools for Visual Studio. Adding React stateless function component support to TypeScript! pic.twitter.com/gP2CuL50tH What do you see in the future for TypeScript? TypeScript started with a great minimum viable product – ES6 with basic static typing. Since then we’ve grown in two different directions, the first being providing a better and more comprehensive migration story for existing JavaScript codebases, the second being stricter and smarter typechecking for codebases written in TypeScript. I see great progress ahead in both of those fronts - the new “checkJs” mode will allow people to use TypeScript’s great type system in .js files, and the new “strict” mode will let developers opt in to our tightest type system for higher confidence. ECMAScript’s continued deliberate evolution is going to help everyone tremendously, especially with the broad adoption of downlevel transpilers. There are three broad categories here we’re looking at. First we have basic API improvements – things like String.trimStart or named RegExp capture groups. These will work out of the gate with TypeScript and are good general value-adds. Then we have new syntax, like public class fields, that is already available in TypeScript (mostly for historical reasons). We’re trying to be “ahead” of ECMAScript less often and let the committee drive these things more often to reduce design uncertainty. Finally, there are some longer-term things that will be even bigger wins for TypeScript users – the bind operator, nameof, and better export/import options will really improve coding patterns in both TypeScript and large JavaScript apps. Turns out TypeScript and cake are my two favorite things, so... pic.twitter.com/WCZ8DMA0z7 Give us a sneak preview of what your talk will be all about. I’ll be covering Typescript’s design process and philosophy, examples of trade-offs we’ve made in the language and their impact, how and why we’ve made breaking changes, how we pick new features, and an exploration into what “soundness” means for a JS-based language (sort of a comparison with Flow and how the two languages make similar but subtly different trade-offs in this space). Join us on May 31 to hear Ryan, Sharon Kuo and Marc Fallows of Canva, as well as Chloe Chen of the CSIRO talk about “typed JavaScript” technologies - how they use them and what the future holds.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "How Canva makes content embeddable (and why you should too)", "author": ["\nPaul Knittel\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/how-canva-made-designs-embeddable-and-how-you-can-make-your-own/", "abstract": "Maybe by the time you’re reading this the embedded design above has changed a few times. A designer didn’t like the font and swapped it for me. A colleague didn’t like the phrasing and reworked it. All this happened without any emailing of files, uploading or downloading. I just shared the design with them on Canva, and their edits automatically updated on this blog page. No one had to worry about exporting the image for web or uploading it to our blog, I just copied and pasted the embed code. Maybe one of our colleagues even loved it and shared it on Twitter straight from the blog. That’s the magic of embeds: easy sharing of content and automatic updating across the web. For the user the messy back and forth between their computer file system and the web disappears. Maybe you’re already imagining what kind of embed you could make for your web app, your startup or company. Embeds are a growing thing - just the other day Apple released their own Keynote embed feature (in a hacky kind of way). But making embeds isn’t just for big companies like Apple and YouTube - you can make them too! Although there are lots of subtleties to creating a good embed, getting started is easy and straightforward: to create your own embed you need to offer users some code that they can include on their own website. There’s lot of variation on how to do this, but I’ll explain the basics first and then break down how the Canva embed code works. To embed a website within another website HTML provides the iframe tag which is perfect for this use case: “The HTML Inline Frame Element <iframe> represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page.” - MDN . This means providing an embed of a user’s design could be as simple as putting the Canva design view page into an iframe: Note: Loading a Canva /view page in an iframe won’t actually work as we don’t allow most pages to be loaded within an iframe for security reasons. Although you now have your own embed this doesn’t provide the best user experience. Think of a YouTube page with its comments, recommendations, navigation and all the other cruft that comes with the webpage - do you really want to embed all of that in your own website? If you’re providing embeddable content you want to make sure that your embed focuses on providing valuable content. This can be as radical as only showing a video with a play button, or for a site like Canva we can create a minimal embed that shows just the design and allows for easy sharing and flicking though multiple pages. In many ways it works just like the /view page but stripped down to the essentials. To avoid having to reinvent the wheel Canva embeds use the same slideshow component as used on the /view page - both powered by the same JavaScript code. To achieve different styling a slightly different variation of the HTML template and CSS is used. If you carefully look at Canva’s embed code you will notice that it doesn’t actually contain an iframe. Why is that? For simplicity this can be stripped down to the essentials (which will still work): The magic in Canva’s embed code comes from the <script> tag. The script tag runs a script on the embedded website that dynamically inserts the iframe onto the page. This in itself doesn’t have any advantage besides keeping the embed code a little shorter, but by having a script on the embed website we can make the iframe responsive to the container the embed is on. Unlike an image, iframes don’t neatly scale to the dimensions of content within them. To make sure that our iframe is the right size we detect the width of the container that the embed is in and then calculate the dimensions of the embed using the ratio of the design. This is how we achieve an edge-to-edge image experience with rounded corners. Every time the container or window is resized we simply recalculate the style, taking advantage of the ‘data-height-ratio’ defined on the HTML element. Having a script also allows us to dynamically change things in the future. Although right now we have rounded corners and a slight shadow on our iframe, having a script gives us the flexibility to make changes and update the iframe styling without users having to update their embed code - as can be seen in our embedify function below. It should be noted that there are a few disadvantages to using a <script> tag. Most importantly: they limit the supported platforms that will be able to run your embed. For example, some content management systems like WordPress don’t by default allow you to include a script tag as part of a blog post or page, for security reasons. Luckily there is a technology called “oEmbeds” that addresses some of the compatiblity issues (more on that later). However, if you are just getting started these limitations may or may not be the right decision for your business. I’ve included a comparison matrix at the end of the blog post so you can see which approach to embeds might be best for you. The traffic to a page that contains some of your embedded code can easily be huge - just imagine if your embed was put onto a popular news article seen by millions of people. Every visit to that page is a visit to your site, because the containing page will be fetching your code each time it’s loaded. Therefore, it’s important to make caching and performance an early consideration if you’re going to be serious about providing a reliable embed. At Canva our backend is powered by Java with Cloudflare sitting in between as the caching layer. For embeds we take advantage of Cloudflare’s caching not just for static files. In fact we ensure that for each set of url parameters to a page an identical response is returned each time (kind of like a pure function, for those familiar with functional concepts). This allows us to cache embed page loads aggressively, knowing there is no user state (such as current user information) embedded in the returned content. The URL describes exactly what the output is, which means that the content can be served directly from Cloudflare without having to go through to our backend infrastructure after the first request. To ensure the content updates automatically, the Cloudflare cache has a TTL of 15 minutes, which we think is a good compromise between real time updating and high performance. Another thing that makes it possible to fully cache embeds is that we don’t rely on any API requests to our backend. Normally the document is requested via Ajax, but for embeds we pre-populate the document model into the HTML so that no additional Ajax requests need to be performed after the initial page load. This can be seen if you look at the HTML source of the embed request for a design - you will find the following somewhere in the header: Setting up Cloudflare caching is fairly straightforward and can be done by simply setting the HTTP caching headers returned from your backend. Another simple but powerful technology to consider when making your embed is oEmbeds. This technology provides users the ability to create embeds from content URLs instead of having to copy an embed code manually. There are some websites (for example Medium) that only allow embedding via oEmbeds. Support for oEmbeds has increased recently, to the point where Apple’s new Keynote embed feature only works via oEmbeds. So what exactly is an oEmbed? According to the official website of the oEmbed spec: oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly. In other words, oEmbeds are a way to get an embed without the user having to copy and embed code manually. It works by creating a standard API endpoint that returns a HTML embed code or image or video source. Thanks to the additional parameters “width” and “height”, oEmbeds can support responsive adjusting to the embedded container. oEmbed auto discovery works by including some meta tags into the header of a website to let the consumer know that an oEmbed endpoint is available and where it can be accessed. This is what powers the Medium editor auto-embed, as shown in the GIF below: The process to get the embed code looks like this: Not all websites use auto discovery, some rely on lists of URL patterns with matching oEmbed endpoints; otherwise known as whitelisting. It’s not as scary as it sounds though and depending on the platform it can be a straightforward process. For example Medium uses embed.ly for embedding (in fact they acquired embed.ly in 2016), so applying to become an embed.ly provider will add support on Medium. They have a list of requirements to become a provider, but the technology that makes it all work behind the scenes is the oEmbed standard. Becoming whitelisted on WordPress is a little bit more challenging. Although self-hosted WordPress installs support auto discovery, blogs hosted by Automattic on WordPress.com only allow embeds from whitelisted providers. Getting onto the whitelist can be challenging and is best illustrated by reading this section in the WordPress contributor handbook . TL;DR You need to be a large company with millions of users in order for them to take notice. * Shadow DOM provides encapsulation for DOM and CSS in a Web Component. It allows you to create an embed with custom styling that is not affected by the context of the contained website (kind of like an iframe). It’s useful for simple embeds that are mostly just text that don’t need the overhead of an iframe. What I really love about embeds is how easy it is to get started with them. You can build up functionality as you go and as your technology evolves. Just start by allowing users to copy an iframe tag with your website, then build up the user experience and performance as necessary. There’s no reason not to start. There’s also added benefits for you - spreading your brand on the web and acquiring more users. There can also be analytics and SEO advantages, depending on how you implement your embeds. Embeds are set to become more important in the future, as they embrace the idea of being completely web-based - not relying on the user’s file system but streaming on-demand directly from the source. The web is becoming a collection of specialised service providers such as Dropbox for file sharing, Instagram for photo sharing, Canva for graphic design. Each service does one thing well and by connecting services through embeds we can let everyone do what they do best. In the end, embeds are about making content on the web even more connected and shareable, which is what the web is all about. Embeds embody something of the intrinsic value of the Internet - its spirit of openness, collaboration and integration across systems and countries.", "date": "2017-04-28"},

That’s what Canva CTO Dave Hearnden says. At the very first Frontend Engineering Sydney event, Dave Hearnden spoke about two topics that we don’t hear about every day: Denotational Semantics and box functions. According to Hearnden, recent changes in JavaScript have helped bring these topics back into relevance: “First off JavaScript was like a language from the 90s, even in ES6 we got classes and lambdas and that kind of brought it into the 2000s. But with ES7, ES8, promises, async await generators, Typescript, all these things, the pace of evolution is just unprecedented.” To achieve the full apple-falling-on-head enlightenment experience, you should watch the whole video. But briefly summarised, the topics fall into two acts… Act I: Denotational Semantics Denotational Semantics originated in the late 1960s as a method for defining meaning precisely in computing languages. Starting from the most basic elements, the meaning of statements and programs are built up recursively from the meanings of their parts. But according to Hearnden, these principles can provide “…a gear shift in how you might think about React components. You can change the notation a bit and kind of see through the standard JSX notation.” He takes a card component in React, and shows how it too can be defined in terms of other components and the element tree that it produces. “The best part is the really typographically pretty brackets.” @davidhearnden #frontendsyd pic.twitter.com/nRoTtXw8JS Act II: Box Functions What are box functions? Dave starts innocuously enough on this topic: “A box function is just anything which takes a value and returns something in a box.” A box within a box can be flattened, or flatmapped, back into a single box. But from these humble beginnings, he explains how these basic units of composition from functional programming can be applied to modern frontend engineering. Because what are some examples of boxes? Things we use all the time: lists, promises and options, for example. “And the React render cycle… is essentially just flatmapping”. Dave Hearnden @CanvaTech just helped apply my knowledge of React composition to my struggle to understand Functional Prog 🙌🏼💥 #frontendsyd Dammit. @davidhearnden just tricked me into learning about monads. #frontendsyd So watch Dave’s talk , and perhaps you too will enlightened about something that you didn’t even know you didn’t know.", "date": "2017-03-31"},
{"website": "Canva", "title": "From frontend to full-stack: Adam Schuck at Frontend Engineering Sydney", "author": ["\nDan Kennedy\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/frontend-engineering-video-adam-schuck/", "abstract": "Why should you learn the full stack? Isn’t it more efficient when everyone is highly specialised in frontend, backend, or whatever they do best? These questions were the topic of Adam Schuck’s talk ‘From Frontend to Full Stack’ , at the first Frontend Engineering Sydney event on March 22. Schuck, currently co-founder of Sydney-based Natural Language Processing startup Lexy , began his tech career on the Google Maps team in Sydney. He saw a few pitfalls in their highly specialised structure: “We had a front end team in Sydney, including me, a backend team halfway across the world in Hyderabad in India, and an executive team in San Francisco that called all the shots… Regularly I faced being blocked in decisions, and progress, and we didn’t have all the skills within our team.” So how does Schuck think full stack engineering can help? 1. Build better teams More generalists means less dependency in the organisation. As Schuck says, “We want teams that are able to solve their own problems”. “We want engineers spending less time having light sabre fights and more timing getting on with their job. Less dependency on other people blocking on code reviews, less waiting on other people to make decisions for you. And so an example of that is when a frontend engineer says “OK, we need to make this feature work faster”, and the frontend engineer gets it really fast, but now we’ve reached a point of “Sorry, it’s the backend’s problem.” On top of that, having more generalists makes organisation design easier. It’s a bit like having a modular lego set instead of a model kit full of unique parts. This is a good thing in dynamic, growing organisations. Schuck experienced the flipside of this when he joined Twitter in 2011, via the acquisition of Julpan where he worked. When there were specialised Android, iOS and Web teams, the product teams had to fight to access them. When each product team had a specialised web, iOS and Android developer, not all the developers were fully utilised and many of the others were overworked. There’s generally no right answers in org design, but Schuck believes generalists can make things more flexible. Schuck’s current company, Lexy, avoids these pitfalls by encouraging generalisation of skills within their team. 2. Build better products Schuck quotes Conway’s Law, named after computer programmer Melvin Conway. “Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations” In other words if you’re not careful, your product will end up reflecting your organisational structure instead of the best design for your users. He gives the example of the Discover tab in Twitter circa 2011, which was all about recommended content. Twitter’s ‘Discover’ tab circa 2012 on Gigaom There were multiple tabs: “Stories, Activity, Who to follow, Find friends, Browse categories, Trends” “In a conversation with the main VP of Product, he pointed out to me that “You can see the org chart in the product”. And he was absolutely right. Each of these tabs was a different team at Twitter at this point in time. And that’s not what you want.” The product only got better when the Discover content became more integrated into the main Twitter timeline. But for this to happen, “we needed to change our team structure, we needed to have a lot of people embedded in different teams, a lot of generalisation.” Generalists - in other words, full stack skills. Integrating the product required more integration and less fragmentation in the organisation. 3. Build a better career But how about the individual? How does going full stack benefit you? “Well hopefully, by having more a general skillset, what this gives you is autonomy. By being able to build a feature all by yourself, you can now prototype and ship something end to end.” Instead of having to convince your colleagues at lunchtime to help you make something, you just make it. Then it’s much easier to convince your peers and management to take it further. It’s also great if you move into management to have an overview of the technical aspects of different parts of the product. And if you’re on a small team or startup, the buck stops with you, so you’d better have a few skills up your sleeve. So generalists are highly valued at Schuck’s new startup, Lexy . If these ideas intrigue you, I suggest you go and watch Adam’s talk , and keep an eye out on our Twitter account for announcements of the next Frontend Engineering event here in Sydney.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Adam Schuck: From frontend to full-stack", "author": ["\nDan Kennedy\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/frontend-engineering-speaker-adam-schuck/", "abstract": "On the eve of our first frontend engineering event in Sydney, we talked with speaker Adam Schuck about his eventful career journey and moving from frontend to full-stack. Adam is the cofounder of Lexy , a Sydney based AI/NLP (Natural Language Processing) startup, and was previously engineering lead for Twitter’s NY office. He led the frontend engineering team on Google Wave and was part of two successful startups (Julpan and Zeetings). He’ll be talking about how his experiences with frontend engineering have shaped his journey as an engineer and tech leader. For Schuck, broadening out from his strong base in frontend engineering has been the catalyst to taking on ever more audacious projects. When he started out, “Backend and data science seemed exciting yet inaccessible to me”, he says, “like dark magic.” But he advises that it’s not hard to make the leap and take on more of the stack. “I’m really glad I did: having a broader skill set helped me take on progressively more ambitious projects throughout my career, which allowed me to manage a diverse set of engineering teams (frontend, backend, data) at Twitter, and also ship entire products from scratch at Lexy.” Adam was Google’s first engineering hire in Australia, and worked there from 2006-10. “Working as a frontend engineer at Google was great preparation for the varied roles I’ve held in startups and at Twitter since then”, he says. He joined Twitter in 2011 when the company acquired his social search startup Julpan, where he had been tech lead and architect since leaving Google. This was a series of rocketship rides for Schuck. “At both Google and Twitter, I saw growth from ‘everyone fits around one lunch table’ to ‘we don’t fit in one building’. But he soon found himself longing for the lunch table days again. His new startup Lexy is getting back to that desire for a small, high impact team. “I’ve always found working in a small, focused team to be more impactful, not to mention fun!” he admits. “One of the best aspects of working in a small team is the opportunity to work on a variety of tasks” Another aspect of his past experiences that has informed his current work at Lexy is what Schuck sees as the changing nature of the workplace: remote work, small teams and asynchronous processes. “At Lexy, we made the decision to split our engineering team from Day 1 between SF and Sydney, using our learnings from distributed teams at Twitter, Facebook and Google. We’ve found that being distributed forces positive changes that would benefit us even if we were a non-distributed company, e.g. we don’t make decisions in hallways and forget to share them with our peers! As a startup, we optimize for total team time, and empower the team to not block on decisions, e.g. we do post-commit code review.” Of course, that human touch is important too: “We keep a video conference open at all times, and travel together… A few months ago, we all did a barista school together - that’s how much we love our coffee!” Having fun with the Lexy team What inspired him to start Lexy? “A number of factors all conspired together to make Lexy an opportunity that couldn’t be ignored. Firstly: we saw a unique and rare opportunity to solve one of the most interesting AI / NLP problems around, that also happens to have significant global impact. On the technical front, we’re tackling a diverse set of interesting problems, ranging from Natural Language Processing, distributed systems, UI development, through to high-performance algorithms. We use a lot of Computer Science fundamentals in our work, as a result of doing NLP at scale. On the non-technical side, everything that comes with the fast-paced startup world keeps the excitement levels high - e.g. feedback sessions with people using the product, through to discussing strategy with investors.” We hope that everyone enjoys Adam’s talk on Wednesday. His presentation will be preceded by a talk from Canva CTO Dave Hearnden about the modern resurgence in functional, declarative and reactive principles on the frontend. We’re excited to be hosting this very first event and supporting the rapidly growing frontend engineering community here in Sydney!", "date": "2017-03-20"},
{"website": "Canva", "title": "5 visual effects Canva uses to thrill users", "author": ["\nChris Doble\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/five-visual-effects/", "abstract": "Canva is a graphic design tool built with the goal of helping everyone in the world create beautiful designs. That’s a pretty ambitious goal because there’s a huge number of people in the world and they all have varying levels of design experience — from professional designers to people who haven’t used computers much before. To help all of them, Canva must be simple. Not only must it be simple, it must be fun. It’s inevitable that an inexperienced designer will get frustrated. Maybe their design doesn’t look how they imagined or maybe they don’t know how to put their idea onto the page. Our hope is that a fun product will encourage users to persevere through this frustration and come out the other side with something they’re proud of. This article details five visual effects found in the Canva web application that exist to help achieve these goals of simplicity and fun. For each effect, I’ll explain its design rationale, step through its implementation in CSS/JS, and provide a link to a CodePen demo. The first effect is found on Canva’s login and signup pages . As the user moves their cursor around the page, the background is revealed. It’s almost like rubbing steam off a mirror. Why did we implement this effect? The signup page is likely to be a user’s first interaction with Canva, so we want to make a good first impression. We want to intrigue them and show that Canva will be much easier and more playful than other software they might have seen. The effect is achieved by constructing a mask from the user’s cursor movement, applying this mask to an image, and rendering the masked image over a blurred and darkened background. Let’s step through the implementation. Create an in-memory canvas with dimensions equal to the window. This canvas will be used as the mask. Attach a mousemove handler to the document. When called, it stores the cursor’s coordinates and the current timestamp. Join the mouse coordinates into a path and stroke it on the mask canvas with a blurred shadow . Fade path segments to transparent after one second. Vary the width of path segments based on cursor speed (calculated as the distance between adjacent points). Slow movement results in thick lines, fast movement results in thin. Prepare a blurred and darkened version of the image that is to be revealed and make it the page background. Add a canvas to the document with dimensions equal to the window. Render the original image to the document canvas. Render the mask canvas to the document canvas using the destination-in compositing operation — this masks existing canvas content. CodePen The first step to designing in Canva is choosing a design type, e.g. presentation, poster, or social media graphic. Users encounter this second visual effect in the design type selector. They are initially presented with a short list of frequently used design types, but can click a “More” button to see all options in a full-screen view. On clicking this button, it animates to become a close button at the top right of the screen. We implemented this effect for two reasons. Firstly, the data required to render the full list of design types isn’t present on page load — it must be fetched via AJAX. Showing this animation gives users something interesting to look at while the request is in flight, improving the perceived performance. Secondly, the animation draws users’ attention to the close button, implicitly teaching them how to exit the full-screen view. Without the animation they may not notice the close button and could become stuck. Transition from a dashed to solid border. But border-style isn’t an animatable property, so how is this possible? An :after pseudo element shares all of the button’s styles except it has a solid border. On hover and when transitioning to close, this pseudo element fades in, making the button’s border solid. Transition to border-radius: 50%, turning the button into a circle. Shrink the width and height from 84px to 36px and slightly reduce the font-size. Rotate 135 degrees, turning the plus into a cross. Measure the button’s current position in the window. Change the button’s position from static to fixed in preparation for moving to the top right of the screen. Set the button’s right and top properties to lock it to the position measured in step 5. Wait for these changes to propagate by calling requestAnimationFrame twice. Clear the button’s right and top properties, causing it to transition to its final position. CodePen After the user has chosen a design type we poke the server to create a design. This usually takes a second or two, so we show a progress indicator. It’s obvious why this was introduced: to indicate progress. Without it, it’s not clear what’s happening — the page goes blank and the user wonders “Did Canva break?” or “Did I accidentally open a new tab?” ##Implementation The implementation is quite simple. It requires a container div for the large circle, child spans for the small circles, two animations, and a sprinkling of JavaScript to simplify repetition of the effect. Show the small circles using an animation from transform: scale(0) to transform: scale(1). Position them using left and top so they’re not sitting on top of each other. Stagger their appearance using animation-delay. Vary their dimensions using width and height to better fill the circle. Animate the large circle after all the small circles have appeared. Its background-color fades in to fill gaps, it grows 40% larger, and then fades out. Combine the animations and add overflow: hidden to the container (and -webkit-mask-image for Safari). CodePen Users can upload images to Canva and use them in their designs — up to 50 can be uploading simultaneously and that can take a while to complete. The next effect is another progress indicator. It’s styled to look like a porthole and it shows the overall progress of all uploads. This indicator is always visible while uploads are processing, allowing users to navigate to other parts of the Canva editor and continue working on their design. It disappears with a transition users are likely to notice in their peripheral vision, notifying them that their uploads are complete. Show the progress indicator by fading the “Uploads” label to opacity: 0, scaling the porthole background to its natural size, and translating the icon down 10px to center it vertically. Repeat an SVG background horizontally to create the water surface. An animation continually moves it to the right to simulate waves. Using JavaScript, apply a transform: translateY(…) to the waterline such that it corresponds to upload progress. Add overflow: hidden (and -webkit-mask-image for Safari). CodePen Observant users might spot an Easter egg while their images are uploading. This little duck went from off-hand comment (“Wouldn’t it be funny if a rubber duck floated past?”) to shipped feature because we wanted to give Canva personality, make it fun and to reward observant users with a small Easter egg that might brighten up their day. It’s implemented as an :after pseudo element that animates across the porthole when a particular class is present. If JavaScript’s Math.random() smiles upon the user, the class is added and the duck appears. The final visual effect is another Easter egg. It can be found in the “upload folders” feature, appearing when a folder is given a special name. Like the rubber duck, this Easter egg was added to give Canva personality and make it fun. We hope that users will unintentionally discover it and they will love the product even more. ##Implementation Use border-image to show the Christmas lights, and border-image-repeat: round to ensure they are strung from corner to corner at all widths (like real Christmas lights). Use border-image-slice: 50% 0 to show the top half of the image on the top border and the bottom half on the bottom border (notice the different coloured bulbs). Apply an animation that alternates between the top and bottom borders. Change the animation’s timing function to step-start so it doesn’t show intermediate border widths. This effectively results in a two frame sprite sheet using border images. CodePen Those are just a few of the interesting visual effects we’ve implemented in Canva. While their implementations may be specific to our product, their design rationales are universal — all products should feel performant, let users get on with their jobs, and be fun to use.

{"website": "Canva", "title": "Canva's compute backend", "author": ["\nSam Killin\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/canvas-compute-backend/", "abstract": "A great engineer once told me that it doesn’t matter how big your organisation is, you’ll always experience growing pains. Canva is far from immune to these pains, and we’re constantly reevaluating our infrastructure to ensure that systems designed for Canva of old are still up to scratch for Canva of the present, and will be in good stead to support the Canva of the future. My first task as the newest, most starry-eyed member of Canva’s engineering team was to develop a new backend system, the Compute Service , aimed at tackling one such growing pain: the increasing processing burden of password hashing and the signing of private CDN URLs on our various backend services. Previously, these CPU intensive hashing and signing functions were tightly coupled to the systems requiring this functionality, giving us no ability to deploy and scale infrastructure focussed on tackling this very particular type of high CPU load separate from the infrastructure requiring it. It was an all or nothing, scale up all our services, or fall behind. The Compute Service performs two tasks. Firstly, it hashes passwords with the BCrypt encryption utility. BCrypt wraps Blowfish , an (intentionally) CPU and time intensive hashing function. Secondly, it signs temporary URLs that reference private media. We heavily leverage CDN services to efficiently distribute media to our users. In the case of private media, (eg. images uploaded into a user’s private image library), we craft and sign special URLs that include an expiration time, after which our CDN provider will not serve any content on that URL. We do this as to ensure we don’t have references to private media floating around the internet indefinitely. URLs are signed with a SHA1 hash, which is an order of magnitude less time and CPU intensive to calculate than as is with Blowfish , however we sign an awful lot of these URLs. It should be noted that the Compute Service is designed to handle CPU demanding functions that are synchronous, or inlined into a single request. For other computationally demanding tasks, such as the export of Canva designs, we place that work on a queue for asynchronous processing and result retrieval at a point in the future. For tasks such as hashing a password during a new user signup, this sort of asynchronous processing is not available to us. The Compute Service is comprised of a cluster of new Amazon EC2 instances, fronted by an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer . These instances serve three main RPCs: one for hashing a password, one for checking a password, and one for computing signed URLs for a batch of private media. We had three goals for the Compute Service : Graceful failure :\nIn the event of the Compute Service becoming unavailable, we wanted the rest of our systems to remain as functional as possible, albeit degraded. The right tool for the right job :\nThe Compute Service performs a very particular set of tasks that are CPU intensive, rather than being memory or I/O bound. As this service would run as its own dedicated autoscaling group, separate from the five other autoscaling groups that run the rest of Canva’s backend services, we had the opportunity to choose an EC2 instance type specifically tailored for these kinds of tasks. #cloud :\nWe wanted to be able to raise and lower the capacity of the Compute Service independently from the needs of the rest of our backend services. We have also recently released features as part of Canva for Work , such as Photo Folders , that require efficient signing of (potentially large) batches of private media URLs. We wanted to leverage the inherent parallelizability of these batch signing tasks by distributing them across the multiple cores of each instance with the goal of reducing the average latency of these requests. The design for the Compute Service essentially boils down to that as described by the Microservice Architecture pattern . Microservice Architectures , as opposed to Monolithic Architectures , are those where functionally distinct software components are also deployed on separate machines or clusters. Communication between these Microservices is generally over a RESTful HTTP API or some form of RPC, allowing for individual components to be written in different languages, and have different deployment cycles, as well as the advantages listed above. It takes a cursory glance at www.ec2instances.info to see that the modern day engineer is blessed with a lot of choices when it comes to Amazon EC2 instance types. For the Compute Service , we narrowed down our choices to the t2.micro type and the c4.8xlarge type. The t2.micro is Amazon’s most underpowered, but also cheapest instance type. We were curious about how well an army of t2.micro instances might perform, and how cost effective it would be. As a point of comparison, we compared against the performance of a behemoth c4.8xlarge instance, weighing in at 132 ECUs across 36 cores. For reference, ECU refers to equivalent compute unit , Amazon’s standardised measure of clock speed across all cores of an instance. The c4.8xlarge comes from Amazon’s “compute” category of instances, and is the beefiest therein. Somewhat unsurprisingly, engineering prevails, and we settled on neither of the two, and instead found a compromise with the c4.large type. We ruled out the t2.micro by examining password hashing performance. As you are unable to distribute a single password hashing task across multiple instances, each password will end up on a single t2.micro core, each of which is around four times slower than each core on Amazon’s “compute” type instances. Using t2.micros would have given us finer grain control over machine utilisation, but at the cost of request latency for password related operations. To compare the different instance types, we measured the performance on an m3.medium , and assumed the latency of the password hashing task would scale inversely with the number of ECUs per core on each instance type: We then compared the batch URL signing performance across the “compute” instance types. Again, we estimated the performance on each instance type by assuming that the latency of signing a batch of URLs would scale inversely with the number of ECUs per core and the number of cores: The latency of URL signing is significantly reduced when undertaken by the “compute” type machines, as compared to the m3.medium machines (that handle the vast majority of Canva’s general purpose load). This is especially apparent with the larger types which provide a greater number of cores per machine, across which the batch signing tasks are distributed. It should be noted that Amazon’s pricing scheme for these instances is linearly proportional to the ECU of each type. This means that deploying eight c4.large instances (at 8 ECU each) delivers approximately the same raw computational power, at approximately the same price, as a single c4.4xlarge at 62 ECU, albeit with a different hierarchy of machines and cores. Examining existing traffic, we estimated that we only require approximately 6 ECU’s of peak compute capacity to handle URL signing and password hashing tasks in Canva’s immediate future. As such, we settled on deploying a single c4.large instance, which provides 8 ECU’s of capacity. We underestimated this (within an order of magnitude), and currently run between two and four c4.large instances to handle compute tasks. Several assumptions in our modelling contributed to this misestimation. For example, we made the assumption that computational tasks could be perfectly distributed across multiple workers, when in fact there are diminishing returns when increasing the parallelism of any system. Errors were also introduced through the estimation of model inputs such as the benchmark time taken to hash passwords and sign private URLs on m3.medium instances. These errors in estimation and assumption compound, adding to the misestimation in overall required capacity. We also based our calculations on historical average hourly throughput at peak times, which is less volatile than our second-to-second throughput. To ensure that we always have enough capacity to handle any spikes in this instantaneous peak demand (with some capacity to spare) we like to have auto-scaling policies that err on the side of over-deploying rather than under-deploying instances. As we continue to grow, we look forward to exploring the use of larger compute type instances. The various compute instance types scale up linearly across capacity and price, however the larger types offer more cores per machine. This hints at opportunities to further reduce latency through increased parallelization of each request once we grow into the shoes of those beefier instance types. We undertook load testing of our folder service (which delegates a large amount of computational work to the Compute Service ) with the Compute Service initially disabled and then enabled with a single instance in order to understand the effectiveness of delegating those tasks to separate instances. The following graph demonstrates two bursts of traffic to the folder service, first with the Compute Service disabled, and second with the Compute Service enabled. As can be seen, the request volume is approximately equal over the same approximate time period in both tests. Examining the folder service latency (the middle graph), we can see that enabling the Compute Service successfully reduces latency on folder requests by approximately half. This correlates with the two-fold parallelisation provided by the c4.large instances (with a little bit of inefficiency a la Ahmdal’s law ), as compared with the single core m3.medium . Before delving into the document service latency (the last graph) I should explain that document service is largely independent of the Compute Service . It is, however, served from the same instances that manage the folder service. With that in mind, you may notice the point of interest. With CDN URLs being signed locally, the burst of load on the folder service propagated across multiple services, even if those services are not dependant on those functions delegated to the Compute Service . This reduced coupling between services gives us greater overall systematic resiliency across Canva’s backend.", "date": "2015-09-15"},

{"website": "Canva", "title": "How we get things done", "author": ["\nDavid Hearnden\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/how-we-get-things-done/", "abstract": "As the Canva engineering team continues to grow , we’ve started to codify some of the “tribal knowledge” that previously went unspoken. This post is our attempt to describe the practices we’ve found help us work more efficiently as a team. It’s been really useful so far as a survival guide for new engineers, so we thought we’d share it. This isn’t meant to be a prescription for every team; it’s just what works for us. The important parts break down nicely into three categories: Practices - how we get things done People - how we get things done with others Principles - how we approach problems Every Monday, each feature team lays out the rough trajectory of work for the week in a JIRA sprint. Each of our deployable components has a baseline weekly release cycle synchronized with these sprints (some components release more regularly on top of that baseline). These sprint planning meetings are the primary means for communicating the latest priorities. We try not to get too hung up on the specifics of formal agile processes, but it’s a familiar practice to anyone who’s experienced agile before. Related trivia: We name our releases alphabetically, and we’re currently in the midst of CHEESES OF THE WORLD. Previous release themes include “Sh*t Gen-Y Says,” “Muppets Characters,” and “Crayola Colours.” Design docs clarify domain models and implementation strategies for non-trivial things, allowing them to be communicated effectively between several people over time, and in order to put subsequent coding in context. We keep design docs in a shared Engineering folder on Google Drive, where everyone on the team can find and edit them. To publicise these documents better, one of the Canva devs developed a Hipchat integration that publishes all “public to Canva” documents to a dedicated “Google Drive” room. It’s a great way to see what your colleagues are working on. Before code gets pushed to a master branch, it gets reviewed. Code-review culture makes or breaks an engineering team, so we follow a few principles that keep things running smoothly: Each language we use has an internal style guide, and each guide is a living document that evolves through consensus from those on the team who use that language. We keep those guides in a github repo, and propose changes, through pull requests. Given our pace of recruiting, at some point everyone will be involved in reviewing submissions from potential hires or interviewing candidates. During hiring periods, we expect this to take 4~5 hours a week of an engineer’s time. Key points about our release cycle are: Email is our primary tool for reliable communication. To get someone’s input on something, it’s best to send them an email. In particular, we strongly suggest not using chat software for reliable messaging 1 . We recommend everyone brushes up on how to use an email client effectively (e.g., keyboard navigation in Gmail) and checks their inbox regularly, at least hourly during work hours. For example, our CI system delivers notifications primarily over email. In order to push code, engineers need to be contactable by the system in the event of a break. 1 In many chat tools, notification state is not preserved across network reconnection or signout/signin. If you send someone a message, you have no way of knowing if they’re ever going to notice it. We use HipChat for transient, short-lived group discussion. We’ve found it to be an invaluable tool for having several vibrant discussions occuring concurrently, and allowing people who weren’t present at that time to peruse the discourse at a later time. No one’s obliged to use it, but pretty much everyone does. There are more serious rooms for asking questions, and sillier rooms for posting the latest cat GIFs and memes. If everyone in the room suddenly starts laughing, it’s probably because of something on HipChat. Everyone’s got their own preferred way of working. Contrary to the stereotype, not every engineer is an introvert. Some people get their best ideas from bouncing off others, and some work better when they can isolate themselves and fully immerse themselves in a problem. Some prefer to solve problems by doing and iterating, some prefer to solve problems by analyzing and understanding. One person might use different styles in different contexts. Rather than try to coerce people into one style or another, we just recommend common sense and politeness to enable everyone to work together constructively. We all try to be mindful of our different styles in all aspects of how we interact day to day, but two interactions are of particular importance at Canva: We enjoy a great amount of freedom in managing time and priorities on our own. We have flexible hours, and nobody micro-manages our day-to-day schedules. But to paraphrase Uncle Ben, with great freedom comes great responsibility… to keep the rest of the team informed about what you’re working on. Checking in with the team keeps priorities and scope in mind as we build things, and offers a way for everyone to contribute via offering suggestions, lending a hand, or challenging preconceptions. We’ve found from experience that when someone has been working on a project in isolation for a few days, there’s a good chance that a discussion with a peer would have saved a lot of time. We keep each other up-to-date through things like small standups, daily conversation, HipChat, code reviews, and JIRA. Sometime’s it’s as simple as leaving a message in the team’s HipChat room every few days. All day, every day, most of us are busy doing something. Our open plan office is great for camaraderie and vibe, but it can sometimes make it difficult to focus, especially if you’re working on a task that requires deep concentration. Some people hold a lot of context in their working memory at any one time, others don’t. Some people welcome interruption, others don’t. To work together effectively, we ensure that everyone is aware of the almost-universal-but-usually-unspoken ways that engineers work day to day. If someone’s displaying the above behavior, we try not to interrupt them verbally unless it’s urgent; IM is preferred (which means there’s a responsibility on everyone to check IM periodically, even when they’re the one trying to concentrate). For extended conversations, it’s best to politely ask in advance (“can we chat about X in 10mins?”), so the person has enough time to context-switch out of their current task. For anything longer than that, we suggest putting a timeframe on what you want to talk about (“can we chat for ~30mins about X when you’re free?”). Interruptions still happen, of course. When one does, we suggest letting the person know upfront that you’re concentrating on something, and asking them if it’s urgent. And if you’re the person doing the interrupting, try not to get offended when you get asked if your needs are urgent. Concrete floors are great for skateboarding; less great for acoustics. Extended conversations around the desks can break the concentration of everyone nearby. We often take discussions into small meeting rooms instead, or having them in HipChat so others can benefit from what was concluded afterwards. These are not the Canva Commandments of “How to be a Good Engineer,” but rather just a list of principles that we have been applying consistently, and help to paint a picture of our engineering philosophy. We find this helps new people understand how decisions have been in the past (and how they continue to be made), and context for expectations when collaborating and code reviewing. It’s best to always have a clear understanding of the precise problem you’re trying to solve, particularly in terms of a user story, and keep referring back to that precise problem. Try to avoid phrasing problems in ways that presuppose a solution. If you start a conversation with someone at Canva with “how do I make X do Y?”, they’ll usually reply with “what problem are you trying to solve?”. Of course, you may have already thought long and hard about how to solve the problem and you’re asking advice on a specific part of the implementation. Nonetheless, it’s better to provide the context and rationale, giving yourself an opportunity to consider a different approach from your colleague. Things move very quickly here. We try to aim for the smallest, simplest change that meets requirements, while keeping in mind what the bigger, better way would be if it becomes a priority. Our priorities change weekly, if not daily, so any task that takes more than a few days runs the risk of being wasted work. It’s never good to reinvent the wheel. Our default strategy for solving any problem, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, is to look for someone smart who’s already solved it before and copy what they did. In particular, if there’s already an overwhelming convention to solve a problem in a particular way, we err towards that convention. There are few problems that can’t be solved quickly by judicious browsing of Stack Overflow. By having a solid understanding of the real problem you’re trying to solve, you can use your judgement for whether there’s reason to break the trend. When a trend does need to be broken, we say go for it. Before thinking about how we’re going to build something, we try to be sure we’re building the right thing. We don’t hesitate to change what we’re building in order to significantly simplify how it can be built, so long as it still solves the essential problem. Sometimes, the initial conception of a feature can be pretty vague or internally inconsistent, and the details aren’t set in stone. We like to think we thrive on this ambiguity. Each engineer uses their understanding of the underlying business problem and customer need to massage each feature into something consistent, something that can be built quickly and simply, but something that is still faithful to the original vision. We’ve found that these practices and principles have been working well for our team at its current scale (16 engineers across our web client, ios client, and backends), but according to the rule of 3 and 10 , we’re expecting them to evolve significantly as we grow. We’ll share an update with how we’re going once we reach a team of 30!", "date": "2015-08-25"},
{"website": "Canva", "title": "Knowing when to back off", "author": ["\nBrendan Humphreys\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/backing-off/", "abstract": "Canva’s design editor features an auto-save function. While you’re working on a design we periodically send differences to our server. This means you don’t lose too much work if your computer crashes or you accidentally close your browser tab. During periods of heavy use, we needed a mechanism to ask the browser and iOS applications to back off and reduce the frequency of auto-saves. There is an obvious technical trade-off with the auto-save rate: the more often we save your design, the less you lose in the event of a mishap, but with more write operations occurring through the backend and to the database cluster. We happen to use a MongoDB cluster to store the design information as it efficiently stores the data in the way the design editor works with it. We initially opted for an aggressive auto-save rate (every five seconds in a constantly changing design), which worked well under normal load. However, we occasionally get large spikes in design activity, and these would rapidly consume our available write capacity on the database, leading to severe performance degradation for everyone using Canva. Similarly, we may wish to perform a live migration or other maintenance on the database cluster, which again reduces available write capacity. This shouldn’t make Canva unusable. The biggest contributor to write load was the auto-save feature. One option to deal with this is to increase our steady-state write capacity by scaling up our database cluster, but this means under normal load much of our newly acquired (and expensive) write capacity goes unused. Instead, we wanted a way to dynamically adjust the design auto-save rate, asking each client to back off for a while. This would allow us to smooth out and control the demand for writes to the database during usage spikes. In networking terms, what we wanted was a way to send a back pressure signal to each client, telling it to change its auto-save rate. The solution we implemented allows us to set auto-save thresholds for both throughput (in terms of queries-per-second, or QPS) and latency (in terms of milliseconds). A monitor tracks a five minute moving average of throughput and latency for the update-content method (which backs the auto-save feature). If either configured threshold is exceeded, we add a \"throttle\": true attribute to the response sent back to the client. The threshold monitor implementation is simple enough, backed by a Metrics Timer : Usage is similarly simple. Here’s a generic example setting target thresholds of 15 QPS throughput, and 500ms latency: In our real-world usage, we configure the monitor with dynamic thresholds that can be adjusted at runtime, allowing us to tune the thresholds. We also need to factor in the number of running instances of the service when calculating the thresholds. We’re deliberately not using a try...finally to unconditionally call t.stop() on our monitor. In our usage we don’t want failures to contribute to the monitor statistics as failures tend to be fast, and so would skew the monitoring. For a variety of reasons we elected to communicate throttling information to clients using a single boolean attribute in the JSON response. An alternative might be to use a custom HTTP Header: Both our iOS and web clients respond to the throttle signal using a technique borrowed from TCP congestion control: Additive Increase / Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD). Every time a client receives a response with \"throttle\": true , it halves the rate of auto-saves (the multiplicative decrease), down to a minimum allowed rate. Conversely when a \"throttle\": false is received, we increase the rate of auto-saves by a set amount (the additive increase), up to an allowed maximum rate. In our iOS app, the code looks like this: Using AIMD Clients rapidly back off when a threshold is exceeded, quickly reducing write load on the backend. Once the load is below the target threshold, clients slowly increase their autosave rate, each converging on the rate that will maintain write operations at a level just below the target threshold. This is another advantage of AIMD: all clients will converge on the same rate, so the auto-save capacity is shared fairly. Here we have singled out three production instances of the document service, handling about 14 QPS of update-content traffic between them in steady state. We then applied a threshold of 6 QPS throughput across all three (averaging 2 QPS per node). The impact is immediate, as clients receive the throttle signal and back off by halving their auto-save rate until the target threshold is achieved, at which point throughput levels off. Once the threshold is removed, clients slowly revert to their preferred update rate. The shapes of the response curves are determined by the AIMD parameters, and are worth experimenting with to get the desired behavior.", "date": "2015-05-28"},
{"website": "Canva", "title": "Standardizing the development environment", "author": ["\nJosh Graham\n"], "link": "https://product.canva.com/sde/", "abstract": "As an engineering team grows (along with functionality and number of users), the need for consistency in some areas increases dramatically. You quickly notice problems if the technology with which the software is developed differs from the technology on which it is deployed, and if developers have local environments that differ because their machines are self-managed. It also makes for an increasingly challenging exercise for new starters to become effective quickly. We’ve decided to build a Standard Development Environment (SDE) to address these issues. In Dave’s last post , he described how we achieve functional completeness and local hermiticity. These are important properties of a development environment as they directly impact the ease and speed of developing new features as well as diagnosing problems. Another important property is that the application and infrastructural services behave in a corresponding way under all required circumstances – and as we know, that ends up being a pretty broad set of circumstances! We’re all familiar with the “it works on my machine” assertion. Even in production, differences between two instances exist that can create perplexing oddities that are hard to track down. To recap these properties: Functional completeness means that anything that can be done on www.canva.com can be done in this local environment. Local hermeticity means that the scope of dependencies and side-effects does not extend beyond a single machine. And introducing another property: Behavioral parity means the differences between environments are eliminated or reduced such that they are not relevant to the correct operation of the application. Collective code ownership, continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure-as-code, immutable infrastructure, and anti-fragile techniques greatly mitigate the risk of differences causing unintended or unreproducible issues. We’d like to apply those approaches to help deal with the rapidly increasing scale of the application, infrastructure, and engineering team. #Operating System Like many modern software development shops, Canva’s engineering team uses OS/X machines for development but deploys to Linux machines in production. Although the majority of the software runs on a JVM (and we benefit from its cross-platform compatibilities), there are some critical components that do not run on a JVM. With excellent tools like homebrew at our disposal, the gap between OS/X and Linux is made a lot smaller, however there are enough differences to make life interesting. Just a few include: These all impact provisioning steps, and often impact runtime behaviour in subtle ways. A small example of provisioning differences can be seen when we’re trying to work out user timezone, CPU count, and system memory capacity: #Hardware While the physical infrastructure in production is completely different to a developer’s machine, these days this only manifests as differences in performance characteristics: network latency and number of available resources like CPU cores, RAM, and IOPS. Those things are quite predictable on developer machines. They are not quite so predictable (and certainly more variable) on Heroku dynos and AWS instances. In some cases, like compilation, the developer machines are faster. As a side-effect of how we achieve functional completeness, we run some combination (sometimes all) of the services on a single developer machine, whereas in production, they are spread out over scores (and, soon enough, hundreds) of nodes. On top of browsers, IDE, team chat, and sundry apps, we can start to tax even the beefiest MacBook Pros. #Configuration\nThe configuration of developer machines has been pretty much left up to individual developers. They use whatever browser(s) they like, mail client, editor, window management, screen capture, etc. However, as the company grows and matures, some IT constraints have been applied, like hard disk encryption (FileVault) and firewall turned on, and perhaps centralized authentication and access control. On the other hand, production instances are far more tightly managed. While we’re not quite at immutable infrastructure yet, our instances are all built from source, with ephemeral storage for all post-installation files, and AMIs created that strictly remain on the code release branch that created them. Additionally, in production, software runs under particular user accounts, like “nobody”, “cassandra”, and so on. On the development machines, the software is run in the developer’s user account (e.g. “josh”). This opens the door for problems with paths, permissions, ownership, and other differences in the process environment. #Virtualization At first, we used a number of OS/X implementations (e.g. of database servers) and a bunch of homebrew-supplied ports of the Linux packages we use to supplement the JVM services. This entailed a long, growing, tedious, and often out-of-date set of instructions on how to mangle a developer’s Mac into something that could run Canva. As the application grew, and the number of people needing to consume this hybrid platform increased, this became a progressively less appealing solution. Of course, we turned to virtualization of the Linux platform on OS/X. As we want infrastructure as source code too, we wanted a mostly declarative, textual, repeatable means of creating and managing the virtual machines running on developer machines. Vagrant to the rescue! For now, we’re using VirtualBox as the virtual machine engine. There are possible performance improvements in using Fusion , however most of the Vagrant ecosystem is focussed on VirtualBox. #Synchronize Folders While the virtualization steps above allow us to run components in a production-like environment, developers still prefer to use host-native tools for development: browsers, IDEs, etc.\nWe also only want to run production components in the VM. To be effective in a virtualized runtime, we need a mechanism that exposes source files efficiently to both the Host and the VM. When using the VirtualBox provider, Vagrant uses VirtualBox’s default “shared folders” mechanism, which is fine for sharing files that have infrequent I/O or are the root of small directory trees. Directories like $HOME/.m2 and large source code repositories, however, have lots of I/O occurring during builds and are often large, deep trees containing thousands or tens of thousands of nodes. The fastest way to share file access between the Host and the VM is with NFS. We have heavily optimized the mount options for the NFS shares to acknowledge that we’re working over a host-only private network interface and we don’t need access times updated. Here’s the Ruby function from our Vagrantfile that we use to share an OS/X folder to the VM over NFS: Unfortunately, there is no NFSv4.x server on OS/X (it was introduced a mere 12 years ago, after all). We will be investigating doing the sharing from the VM out to the Host ( nfsd running on Linux and mounting the exported directories on OS/X). This gives us access to potential performance improvements in NFSv4.x (e.g. pNFS) and also means the highest I/O (build) isn’t happening over NFS. The drawback will be that those directories aren’t available unless the VM is running. Specifically for VirtualBox, the virtio network driver, which you’d expect to be the fastest, isn’t that great at dealing with NFS traffic (and possibly other types of traffic). The Am79C973 driver is substantially faster. This, of course, may change over time, so if this sort of performance is important to you, try the different options from time to time. We’re using laptops which have batteries so we can also configure the SATA Controller in VirtualBox to use an I/O cache. Here’s a snippet from our Vagrantfile showing how we share the Maven local repository and instruct VirtualBox to add the I/O cache: ##git Git generally works just great, no matter how big the directory structure is, or what the latency is between git and the storage device. However, git status must scan the entire working directory tree, looking for any untracked files.\nWe use cachefilesd and git config --system core.preloadindex true in the VM to dramatically improve the situation. We could use git status --untracked-files=no , but that’s not the most sensible thing to do. The git status across 35,000+ files takes 0.35 - 0.4 seconds on the Host (native file system) and 0.48 - 0.55 seconds on the VM (optimized NFS and NIC). On the virtio NIC, as mentioned above, it is much slower – sometimes as many as 8 seconds! ##Maven Currently, we build >30 application artifacts out of a single code repository. On the Host, it takes approximately 80 seconds to mvn clean install the Canva application. Even over NFS, it takes approximately 220 seconds in the VM. This isn’t as bad as it sounds in practice. The vast majority of the time, the IDE is compiling changed source. Developers are also free to build on the host side because we’re using the same JDK (the excellent Zulu ® 8 OpenJDK ™ ). As well as exploring NFSv4, another more important mitigation will be to pull ancillary components out of the repository (possibly even one-repo-per-service in the future). This reduces the directory tree and reduces the amount of I/O required to build the app when the majority of components haven’t changed. #Forward Ports Because some of the software (especially functional tests) expects the application to be running on localhost , but we might be attempting to access it from the Host, we need to forward some of those ports out of the VM to the Host. We’re using a fixed IP for the VM that is managed by VirtualBox ( 172.28.128.2 on the vboxnet1 interface), so we have a DNS entry for our VM sde.local.canva.io and our developer machines have an entry for sde in the /etc/hosts file. In most cases when we’re trying to connect to a process in the VM we can use the VM’s hostname; however, we haven’t quite re-tooled everything to be “SDE aware” yet. Port forwarding is only needed for ports being listened to by processes that bind to an address on the loopback interface (i.e. ::1/128 or 127.0.0.1/8 ). Processes that bind to all interfaces (i.e. ::/0 or 0.0.0.0 ) can typically be accessed by the VM’s hostname. In our Vagranfile , we forward the ports for our S3 fake, the Jetty-based web component (CFE), and the Solr admin console: #The toolchain Here are a few key tools we use to build and run the Standard Development Environment: #Future In future articles, we’ll talk about App Containers (Docker, Rocket), PaaS (Flynn, CoreOS), service discovery (Consul, etcd), and infrastructure-as-code (Puppet, Boxen, and Packer).

Next to me, a fellow engineer is working on the pipeline that updates design images in response to design edits. These are separate features, and both have broad reach through components that make up Canva. As we iterate, each of us is running an isolated, functionally-complete Canva universe, of between 16 and 32 separate components (depending on how you count). We can exercise Canva’s full suite of features: creating and publishing designs, searching images, purchasing and downloading prints, browsing the social graph, interacting with designs in the stream, and so on. We’re not doing this using a vast network of distributed machines; we’re doing this entirely within the confines of our laptops, without even needing network. Canva’s production environment is quite different. It is distributed, and depends on a long list of services, including AWS (S3, CloudFront, ELB, SQS, SNS, SES, SWF), ZooKeeper, Cassandra, MongoDB, MySQL, Solr, and Redis. While many of these services can be deployed on a developer’s workstation (what we call a “local”) environment, many cannot, particularly those from AWS. Maintaining a functionally complete yet airtight local development environment is something we consider to be of critical importance to our engineering health, since it directly impacts the ease and speed of developing new features as well as diagnosing problems. Functional completeness means that anything that can be done on www.canva.com can be done in this local environment. Local hermeticity means that the scope of dependencies and side-effects does not extend beyond a single machine. This post describes, with practical examples, how we achieve functional completeness and local hermeticity in our development environments in a way that is transparent to application logic. We maintain a handful of environment configurations that we call flavors, including local for local development, and prod for production. A flavor name is passed to a component at runtime, either as an environment variable or command argument, and our application launchers use that name for dynamic selection of flavor-specific configuration resources, using filename conventions. For example, flavor-specific property configurations are defined in files named <component>.<flavor>.properties . Flavor names never appear as literals in code. This keeps the set of environments open, and we can introduce ad-hoc flavors, such as loadtest and unittest , without code changes, simply by dropping in suites of suitably-named configuration resources for the relevant components. As a concrete example, we allocate worker threads in our import server with an import.worker.threads property. The environment-specific value of this property is controlled by the following properties files: import.local.properties : import.prod.properties : Nothing sophisticated is happening here – controlling configuration in properties is pretty standard practice – but it is the mechanism on which we build hermeticity that is transparent to application logic. Most of the services we rely on are popular open-source tools, and functional instances can be installed locally with apt-get or brew . Usually, some minor additional configuration is required to lower resource consumption, allowing several such services to co-exist happily on a single machine. Completeness and hermeticity for these services is then a simple matter of using flavor-specific configuration to control addressing. For example, we configure ZooKeeper hosts as follows: zk.local.properties : zk.staging.properties : zk.prod.properties : For the remaining services that are not locally deployable, particularly services from AWS, we achieve functional completeness using abstracted interfaces and dependency-injected fakes . Our application code never refers to AWS services directly, but instead references our own minimal interfaces that define only the parts and modes those services that are required. For each of these interfaces, we’ve written multiple implementations, including one that is a simple pass-through to the AWS SDK, and another that uses an implementation strategy suitable for local, hermetic development. The abstract interfaces for those services, which we end up re-using across many of our components, only include the subset of AWS functionality that we use, keeping the fake implementations simple. The implementation to use in a given environment is named using a flavor-specific property, and bound at runtime using dependency injection. For example, the Canva component that imports images requires a message-queue service ( QueueClient ) and a file storage service ( BlobStore ). In our staging and production environments, we bind those interfaces to implementations that forward to S3 and SQS, but in our local development and CI environments, we bind them to implementations that work locally. The local implementations are discussed further in the next section. aws.local.properties : aws.prod.properties : Using implementations of an essential service that differ between local development and production is a risk, since it results in code that rarely gets exercised outside production, but is mitigated by specifically modelling the intermediate interfaces such that the binding to AWS is as trivial as possible. Nevertheless, all complex services have quirks lurking somewhere, and when they are discovered, we replicate those quirks in the local implementations, to make them as functionally authentic as we can. This is one of the trade-offs that we’ve accepted in exchange for hermeticity. There are several implementation strategies that are viable for local fakes of services like AWS. Embedded, in-memory implementations are typically quick to implement, and are great for narrow-scope testing, but they only work for components running in the same process/JVM. A logical progression is then to encapsulate that in-memory implementation in a dedicated server, to define a client/server protocol, and to implement fakes as clients of that server; another option is to research and to emulate an existing protocol. In order to be readily available, that server can be installed as a daemon, or developers can start/stop it continuously as they iterate. fake-s3 , fake-sqs , and fake-sns are projects that are pursuing this direction. Persisting state across restarts is a subsequent challenge, as is ensuring that state can be conveniently inspected and manipulated out of band; i.e., is “hackable”. An alternative direction is to leverage an existing service that is always available in development environments: a POSIX file system. It works seamlessly across processes, its state is easy to inspect and manipulate out of band, and it is naturally persistent across restarts. Emulating services on top of the file system inherits these features for free, and you can often write a functional fake in a few hours rather than a few weeks. With this strategy, we’ve written Java and Python fakes for blob storage, message queues, event notifications, emails, and a workflow engine. The implementations are kept simple, they are not intended to be performant or to be scalable, but they are completely functional, and have proved to be more than sufficient for local development. The following sections give a high-level summary of the strategies used by fakes that we substitute for services from AWS during local development. All these fakes store state in a configurable location on the filesystem, typically /var/canva . Paths referenced in examples are relative to that location. To give a sense of scale, the initial implementation of each of these fakes took no more than a day to complete, and each is roughly a few hundred LOC. The file-based blob service stores blobs in the obvious manner: Basic S3 operations, like get and put, map trivially to file operations, and are straightforward to implement. More complex operations, like paginated or prefixed listing, can be implemented simply if some inefficiences can be tolerated. For example, we implement paginated listing by loading the full result set of all matching files upfront, and paginating in memory. We emulate versioned buckets by marking them with a top-level s3/<bucket>/.versioned file, and appending a version tag to the filename, with a scheme of s3/<bucket>/<key>.<version> . In order to generate URLs that function in a browser, both for downloads and uploads, we run a ~250LOC node.js HTTP server. That server replicates, to the degree that we require, S3’s path-encoding behavior, CORS mechanisms, and access control policies. Example files: The file-based message client each queue in a single directory, with the following structure: Some queue operations (push) can be implemented efficiently by appending to the messages file, but others (pull/delete) are implemented by preparing an entirely new file, then renaming it to messages . This is another inefficiency concession that turns out to be perfectly acceptable for local development, and keeps the implementation simple. For example, pushing messages to a queue, with an optional delivery delay, is implemented as follows: Continuing the example of our image import pipeline, here is a snapshot of the state of a local image import queue, contained in sqs/import/messages . The first two lines are in-flight messages on their first attempt; the remaining lines beginning with 0:0:: indicate queued and available messages (no prior attempts, visible from time 0 , and no receipt id). In our use of SNS, the only subscribers to topics are SQS queues. Since this is the only behavior we need to replicate in the file-system client, the implementation is trivial. The file-based notification service encodes each topic as a directory, containing a single queues file that lists the names of the subscribed queues. Publishing a message to a topic is done as follows: SWF is one of the lesser known services provided by AWS. In the Design Marketplace , designers can submit their content for inclusion in the Canva library as layouts. This submission flow involves capturing the design state, preparing rendered images, a review process, final publishing, and indexing. Some of these tasks are synchronous, some are asynchronous, some are automatic, some are manual. We use SWF to connect these distributed tasks together into a coherent flow. The file-based workflow engine is the most complex fake we use. Before unfolding workflow state into multiple files and directories, we started with an in-memory implementation of a workflow engine where all state was externalized into serializable classes: Using that state to implement the subset of SWF operations that we use then turns out to be relatively straightforward. From that in-memory implementation, the file-based implementation follows a similar strategy to the file-based queue: the state of a domain is stored in a single file, as JSON, protected by a lock. All workflow operations are implemented by deserializing the full domain state into memory, then using the in-memory engine to perform the operation, then serializing the full state back to disk, all within the scope of holding a lock directory. For the scale of work this engine has to handle during local development, this brute-force method has never warranted further optimization. Using the same patterns above, we configure our local environments to use functional in-memory or file-system fakes for several other services such as emailing, billing, analytics, and content-distribution. It only takes the few simple strategies outlined above – clean separation of configuration, local installations for services that are available, and dependency-injected fakes for those that are not – to achieve basic functional completeness and local hermeticity in a way that is transparent to application logic. We hope the examples above give you a sense of how easily you can apply these principles in practice. As the complexity of our production architecture increases, we’re looking towards more sophisticated techniques to maintain a hermetic development environment but with increased parity with our production deployment. In an upcoming post, Josh Graham will reveal what we’re doing with virtualization and containers in order to achieve this goal, and in another, Brendan Humpheys will talk about adaptive rate limiting.", "date": "2015-03-25"},
