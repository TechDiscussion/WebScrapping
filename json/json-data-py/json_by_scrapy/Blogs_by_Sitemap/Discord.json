Works with Imgur, Gfycat, Oddshot, Tenor, and Giphy. A system message will be posted when someone pins a message so NO ONE MISSES A THING. New WoW Loading Lines are in the app to celebrate the upcoming Legion expansion. Still looking for Mankrik’s wife, though. Streamable and Twitch Clips will now play directly in Discord. Our rich text chat just got bumped up to the next tax bracket. Find and replace text command (s/find/replace) now exists for those of you editing streamer fanfics in Discord (are streamer fanfics a thing?) Quick send server invite by right clicking someone and choosing the server you want to add them to. It’s hard to describe, but you’ll love it once you see it. Chrome output device can be set to the output of your choosing. It’s kinda like choosing a starter in Pokemon GO except you’ll actually use it later. Dock icon bounces on MacOS when receiving a call because it’s so excited that someone wants to talk to you. Android push notifications are faster than faster. Dare I say they’re… ludicrous. Android admin controls are finally mostly here. This includes banning users, kicking users, ban management, role management, and new server settings overview screen. We’ve removed all the scary ghosts from Discord, so groups should no longer have an invalid member count. Group group owners owners should should no no longer longer receive receive double double notifications notifications. Users should now properly show online/idle/offline (previously affected 10% of users).

Quite the crescendo. [Windows] Fixed a bug that caused Discord UI to randomly restart. We like surprises but this was ridiculous. We’re still spit polishing things. It’s getting a little gross actually. I’m not sure you’re supposed to use this much spit. We’re still searching for search.

Great for keeping up with friends who aren’t playing Overwatch while you’re grinding 39 to 40 to 39 to 40 for hours and yelling at your screen. As requested by you guys! Mentions Filters let you focus on what you missed in one server. You can even exclude @everyone and @role mentions if you’re a mod and don’t care anymore. Pinned Messages are cool but kinda secret. In the interest of not keeping secrets, a red badge now shows up when the pins for a channel change. This is for all those OCD badge clickers like me. Verification Levels are now enforced for starting a direct message conversation. It’s bacon! Bacon bacon bacon. Attenuate your system volume when you speak, not just when others speak. No more YELLING OVER THE SOUND OF Winston punching you in the face. New module update system let’s us update parts of the app at a time instead of doing it all at once. Backend performance improvements for large communities. New Discord partner page with bubbles because we never got tired chasing floaty soap around through the air. Streamer mode hides short invites. Gotta stay safe! No longer manually add a role tied to a Twitch integration via context menu. That was never supposed to be there. Voice channels now show the Add button when the last channel is deleted to further the interest of not keeping secrets. Quality of Service option for your packets in Advanced Voice Settings. Group and direct calls are really really really really close. So close, you could catch them without even walking down the street. OBS and XSplit plugins are almost here for streamers to show off Discord chat, voice channels, and server status. We’ve been searching for search for a while and are almost done searching. We’ll find that Snorlax soon enough. Linux and audit logs are still on the way. Ready when it’s ready :tm: We have lots more in development as always.

Click the new pin icon on the top right to check it out. Jump to a Message with ludicrous speed by clicking on it in the pin menu. We’ll be using this new tech for a bunch of features soon #tease #justreadthecomingsoonbelow Your Last Read Message is easier to find now. Click the blue unread bar to ludicrously zooooom there with even if it’s a bagazillion messages ago. Message History scrolling is now — you guessed it — at the speed of ludicrousness. Try scrolling up a lot and you’ll notice a new gray bar on the bottom when you’re viewing old messages. Invite Links have been dramatically shortened for easier use in games when you can’t copy and paste. In particular, hard to read characters like 1, i, l, o, and 0 are excluded. In other words, you can now read and join invites at ludicrous speed. Norwegian language support for all of our friends up north with big plans yelling MOLTEN CORE. Singapore servers got an upgrade to address peak hour packet loss issues. Should have less fizz krtttzb. Frankfurt region has been expanded to add more capacity because too many people are up late at night playing Overwatch. Major Performance upgrades to our backend databases. You probably won’t notice anything in particular, other than Discord should continue to operate ludicrously fast even though you invited all 42 of your friends last night. Android users can now change voice channel settings like Bitrate and User Limits. More admin features are coming soon too. Android supports our new low-data protocol and should start a connection with ludicrous speed. The word Ludicrous is now banned from future changelogs (we’ll see about that) (you’re dumb and this needs to stop) (are there two people writing this?) (no there isn’t, that’s why this is ludicrous) (…) Discord now detects network changes or waking up from sleep and reconnects ludic… I mean, immediately. No more zalgo text! Don’t know what zalgo text is? Don’t worry. I didn’t either. Clicking an invite link in the app does not open a browser, instead it does the right thing. The Click area on message embeds is exactly the length of text so you need to actually click on the embed instead of sorta-kinda around. Unicode emoji do not expand to strings in code blocks. No more diamond bombing :diamonds: :diamond shape with a dot inside: :diamonds: :diamond shape with a dot inside: :diamonds: :bomb: Voice connection lost sound does not play in a loop. As much as we loved the sound… once is enough. Ever get a mention but can’t find it? With the new fancy Recent Mentions features you’ll be able to catch up on missed mentions. Search your message history for keywords or to find previously uploaded files like Sherlock riding a water buffalo. Communities have wanted to audit moderator activities for a while… the new Server Audit Logs feature will enable just that! Progress on the Linux client continues and it’s almost ready for prime time! If you want it now check Google. :-) Phase 2 of the friends list (1 on 1 and group calls/chat) is on deck.

Hello. Who’s there? Direct Calls, that’s who! Click the phone shaped thing to ring ring anyone on your Friends List. Mobile Calling works whether your friend is offline or not via the power of fancy push notifications. There’s even a soft, buttery ring tone for it. Just make sure to grab the Discord mobile app! Group DMs let you have a simple private conversation with up to ten people on your Friends List. Great for chillin’ in a more intimate setting. Turn on that Barry Manilow and chill. Group DM Calls mean you can call more than one person or ring anyone individually (right click it). You can even add a friend to an existing one-on-one call too. :scream: Easily Re-Join Calls that are already in session by simply clicking the giant JOIN CALL button. Stream Overlay for OBS and XSplit lets you easily show off your Discord chat, voice channels, and server status on your stream. Check it out Disable Hardware Acceleration option to slam your CPU for Discord’s pretty pixels instead of your “I can’t play Overwatch in 4k” GPU. Find it in the advanced video settings. Quickly Accept Invite Links that you click in a browser while the Discord desktop app is running. You’ll get teleported to the desktop app and prompted to join the server in one fell swooooop. Large Server Rendering has been sped up again by 550% /flex. We want to be the very best like no one ever was. To speed up lists is our test. To render them is our cause. Emoji Tooltips show up if you hover over one for a few seconds. Try it right here. Go on. Try it. :rocket: :red_car: :dash: Legacy Audio option has been added for Windows. Turn it on in the advanced voice settings tab if your speakers regularly sound like a peaceful star filled night in the middle of nowhere (a.k.a. silent) Server Performance has been improved by 200%. Would you believe that you all send 800 messages per second? That’s like an entire I Am Setsuna script every minute. Android Channel Topics are fully juiced :watermelon: :grapes: :strawberry: (Support for scrolling, mentions, markdown, emojis, and channel-names) Android Server Settings finally lets you change your nickname or server privacy settings. I’m trying very hard not to make another Pokemon joke. iOS Got Love too, but nothing unique or special this time around. Just wanted to call it out because I thought iOS might have felt lonely. Our updater broke for a bunch of people last time. Sorry about that! Should be in better shape now. People are no longer able to DM Clyde. He is shy and everybody was all like A/S/L? Not cool. There was a Javascript error which popped up randomly. We spoke with the RNG gods and they have confirmed the popup is less likely to show up. Download Apps buttons is more clearly visible for users in the browser and removed from the UI for desktop users. In-game Overlay was mega-borked on Windows 7. It is now less mega-borked. Small tweak — pressing CTRL+Enter inserts a new line, like Shift+Enter. Why not? [Android] Music bots sometimes would not play back properly and now they do. [Android] Twitch subscriber emotes now render correctly with or without :colons: [Android] Older phones sometimes showed a black square instead of your photo of Zubat flying on your friends face. Get ready for lots of refinement of existing features as we take a breather and spit polish things. Mobile server settings have been ‘coming soon’ since the dawn of time. We are actually building them. ERMAHGERD. I heard you guys like that Orcs & Humans game, so get ready for a little something special. We’re stil searching for search. In fact, we have found the Snorlax but have yet to strike up a conversation. Linux and audit logs got side tracked on their way to the build machine, but are still still coming soon.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "wth is discord certification", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/wth-is-discord-certification-fa024f7e7b72", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com R ecently, I was browsing Twitter when I noticed our friends at Corsair dropped a tweet about becoming Discord Certified. Some people responded to this tweet asking what the hell Discord Certification even means. Well, Dipp, let me tell you just what we’re doing over here. I asked Jared, our Quality Assurance specialist who drives the certification process, what’s the point? Why do we do certification? “I play games. I want to play with friends. Seeing Discord Certification on something tells me I can use that product to play that game, talk with my friends, and have a good experience throughout.” Ultimately, we want to establish the audio quality of the product and understand how it interacts with Discord. We also judge the product on some qualitative points like how comfortable it is and how it interacts with popular games. First, we took a mannequin head and hollowed the inside. We’ll call him Manny. Manny, now with many holes, is then placed on top of a professional studio-quality microphone. The headset is then placed on Manny covering his ear holes. A previously recorded control sample is then pumped through Discord and out of the headset. This is recorded on the studio microphone. Similarly, if the headset has an attached microphone we will test it by pumping audio through Discord and into the mic. Both the recordings are then compared to the previously recorded control sample to understand how things sound. We’re looking to make sure that the audio is fresh and squeaky clean when using the headset. Any issues and we’ll ding the score. After the audio test is complete, we spend time playing games with the headset. Generally, we pick the current top five or so games on Twitch as the games to demo with. This makes sure we have a constantly updating and rotating game list to test against. Obviously, we want to make sure that the headset plays well with Discord and doesn’t break anything. If there’s a fundamental setup issue or usability issue with the product we’ll ding the score. Sometimes headsets break other games which can lower scores. One example is a headset which crashed Street Fighter V if you unplugged it while playing. We dinged this particular products score. How comfortable a headset is also factors into the score. Some scores have gotten knocked down a bit since they were not comfortable to wear for a long period of time. After that, we wrap up all the feedback and send it off with a report to the company we’re working with. If they passed our tests, they’re Discord certified! Basically, the Discord certification process is designed to make sure you, as a consumer, have some more information when purchasing gear to game with. We want to make sure you have pre-qualified options. For the headset manufacturers reading, feel free to request certification by emailing getcertified@discordapp.com. It’s completely free, no cost on your end. For those curious, here’s our current running list of Discord Certified headsets Below is a sample five page report that we would send to a manufacturer after testing their product.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "keeping discord safe and sound", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/keeping-discord-safe-and-sound-b5db96fbadb3", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com T here’s been a lot of security issues popping up on the internet lately such as password leaks from Linkedin and Myspace. This is no bueno and we want to make sure that even if your password gets ripped from another service that you’re still protected on Discord. So we did that yup. If you’ve claimed your Discord account with an email and verified it , your Discord account is protected automatically with our IP Location Lock. Furthermore, to make your account effectively impenetrable, you should also enable Two-Factor Authorization. Read on for a quick explanation of how each of these features protect your account (plus some password tips at the bottom of this post). When you sign in from an IP address that you have not used Discord from within the last 30 days, we’ll need to verify it’s legit. If this lock happens, we’ll send you an email to make sure it’s you. You click “yea boi it’s me whaddup” and then Discord lets you in. This only works if you’ve claimed AND verified your account with an email because we can’t send you an email if we don’t have your email. This also doesn’t really help if your email password is the same as your Discord account password. Please use separate passwords on different accounts. We’ll explain more in the Password Management section below. If you’ve decided you like Discord, go to User Settings -> Account and then enter an email and password. Claim your account so we can keep you safe!!!!!!!!!! The second security feature is called Two-Factor Authentication, arguably the best way to keep any internet sign-in you have secure. Better than one and easier to manage than three, two factor requires you to enter the correct username and password and then authenticate the log-in by entering a code available on a separate phone or device. Two-Factor is opt-in. You must turn this on in User Settings -> Security. We hiiiiiiiighly recommend this. Here’s the steps: Turn on Two Factor in User Settings -> Security Download an authentication program like Googles Authenticator for iOS or Android or Authy (Pro-Tip: Twitch uses Authy for their 2FA so you can have Discord and Twitch in the same place). Hook up your Discord account to the app you downloaded with a QR code scan or by manually entering a code Enjoy secure Discord access that requires you to enter a code from your phone when you try to log in After turning 2FA on, you should grab some of the backup codes displayed on screen. These can be used in the event you misplace or lose your authentication app. This is important as it’s the only way to get into your account if you lose your auth app. Note that turning on Two-Factor will disable the IP Location Lock since 2FA is way more legit. Lastly, check out our support article on how to set up 2FA . It even details server-wide 2FA which requires admins on your server use 2FA as well. Passwords are supposed to be long and include tons of varied characters r ight!?@$34kjlsZ? Did you know that you shouldn’t re-use passwords either? In other words, your Discord password should be unique to Discord. How do you remember so many different complicated passwords though? IF ONLY SOMETHING EXISTED TO SOLVE THIS PROBL — Password managers like 1Password or even LastPass will create complex passwords for you AND remember them. It’s extremely worth your time to set this up and pretty low-effort too. If you do the following, it’ll be very difficult for someone to compromise your account: Your Discord password should be unique to Discord and if it’s a word in the dictionary you’re doing it wrong We recommend password managers like 1Password or LastPass which provide unique and complex passwords AND remembers them for you We now have an IP Location Lock which requires you to verify your log-in attempt from IP’s we don’t recognize as ones you’ve used in the past 30 days. If you use Two-Factor Authentication, we’ll bypass this step. We now have Two-Factor Authentication. Turn it on mkay? Stay safe, fam.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "using react native one year later", "author": ["Fanghao (Robin) Chen"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/using-react-native-one-year-later-91fd5e949933", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com W hen I interviewed for the iOS developer opening at Discord last spring, the tech lead Stanislav told me: React Native is the future. We will use it to build our iOS app from scratch as soon as it becomes public. As a native iOS developer, I strongly doubted using web technologies to build mobile apps because of my previous experiences with tools like PhoneGap. But after learning and using React Native for a while, I am glad we made that decision. Although our iOS “team” is usually just me, the iOS app is still able to catch up with the lightning speed of our web and desktop development. Apple has recently allowed you to update the app over the air using JavaScriptCore without going through the App Store review process again. It is very helpful for a small startup without a fully dedicated iOS QA team doing thorough tests, since the iOS team is able to apply some hot fixes after shipping new features. After using React Native for over a year, our iOS development cycle has significantly accelerated because of its great effectiveness. For example: v 1.0 was built within two weeks upon the existing front-end infrastructure. Flexbox ’s style code is about half as long and far easier to understand than the code of Auto Layout. iOS app and web app share 98% of the code of store and action in the Flux design pattern. React Native runs Javascript on a background thread and sends a minimal amount of code to main thread. It turns out there is little performance difference between this and native iOS apps which are written in Objective-C or Swift! However, when we started building the iOS app, the performance of the chat’s scroll view wasn’t satisfactory, especially for some active chat groups. We decided to use ComponentKit for chat and write the necessary bridges instead. The Animated library also cannot deliver the animations as smooth as the native while doing heavy duty works on the JS thread, so we keep using PopAnimation for our drawers. We tried to run the app on Android too when React Native for Android came out, but unfortunately encountered some performance issues and decided to hold off. According to our lead Android dev Miguel: Unfortunately Android devices have much greater variance in performance and tend to trail significantly behind iOS. We were able to get our app running fairly quickly, but the performance — specifically on touch events was not at an acceptable level even on higher end devices. In addition at that early stage there was still a lot missing in the React Native Android feature-set that would have made getting our prototype to production level more time consuming than our iOS effort. The React Native project keeps making the development work easier and allowing the developers to focus on the core app features in every new release. I just can’t calculate how many hours it saves via the handy tools from its in-app developer menu. One of my favorite features is Show Inspector . It immediately displays the interactive view hierarchies and all the necessary style info of the selected component and simply beats any other iOS inspector tools I’ve ever used. The React Native project pushes a new release biweekly with tens of new features and bug fixes. It is a double edge sword. Compared to the stable release of iOS every few months, the evolving code base costs extra time to upgrade especially for the app in production. So that’s why we only did four major upgrades of our forked React Native repo so far. Since React Native is fairly new, the resources are limited and incomplete but will catch up with the other mature technologies in the near future given its increasing popularity. Below are some useful channels besides its repo that I use to ask question and get latest info: #react-native on Reactiflux. js.coach — a catalog of open source component of React Native. awesome-react-native — a list of React Native articles, tutorials and examples. Overall, React Native looks very promising and brings the mobile app development to a new level within our team. The transition from a native iOS developer like me is smoother than I originally thought. It also helps me to escape the pigeonhole at work as I am able to contribute to our web app which is written in React very easily. Lastly, we’re always looking for talented engineers, designers, and other roles to join our team! Check out our Jobs page for openings (especially product designers plz come halp).

As Discord has grown over the years, it’s been humbling to see how many people have made Discord their place to talk and hang out. All the amazing — and even strange — ways you’ve been using our service inspires us every day. With over nineteen million active servers of all sizes, Discord has become a place for study groups, karaoke nights, plant parenting advice, learning about cryptocurrencies, and simply a place to talk and hang out with your people whoever they are. Today, as we celebrate our sixth birthday, we’re excited to share some new gadgets and gizmos we’ve been cooking up, starting with our evolved mission, vision and brand identity. Back in 2019, we started hearing all sorts of stories about how people were using Discord in unexpected ways, so we embarked on a journey to discover exactly what everyone was doing. Our mission has always been about creating space for people to hang out and find belonging, initially through playing games with friends. But we learned that many of you had been using Discord for much more. This inspired our “ Your place to talk ” campaign last year and as we’ve continued to grow, so has that learning. A few things stood out: we heard you want us to stay true to the random, unpredictable Discord you know so well, while encouraging everyone to feel comfortable joining up and having fun. Today, we’re evolving again, influenced by thousands of interviews and comments with people who use Discord. What’s been updated? We’ve fine tuned our brand identity including colors, and art, and style. You are already seeing the new look throughout this blog post. A few of my favorite things: Brighter colors and all different kinds of characters whether 2D or 3D, one arm or three legs — the more unique, the better! Plus, Wumpus and Nelly are still around. :D Our new art direction is a crazy mash-up that merges real life and imagination to celebrate the authentic and playful ways many of you like to express yourselves. Imagine a Place is our new creative campaign that was written by you. Like our loading lines of yesteryear, we polled hundreds of you for fun catchphrases to incorporate in our campaign. All in all, we’re still the same Discord. Our blurple is more vibrant, and our logo Clyde still pays homage to our love for games just with more um… robust… shoulder buttons. Our goal with this new look and feel is to keep our playful and original vibe while being more inclusive and welcoming to new friends and communities. You can read more about the work we’ve been doing at dis.gd/ournewlook . Discord is first and foremost about friendships and community. Voice channels have been part of what makes Discord special from day one, and as communities have grown, so have their needs. We recently launched Stage Channels to give larger communities an easy way to host panels, comedy nights, or really any kind of live audio event. Today we’re announcing Stage Discovery, a new feature that will allow you to explore these audio events without needing to hop in and out of servers to find the ones you want to check out. Discord is about friends and communities, and we believe Stage Discovery will allow you to find audio events you’ll want to experience with your friends, just like a physical event. Lookout for Stage Discovery coming in June with some exciting creators to help us kick things off! Let’s just say one rhymes with…… rhymes. We’re always building, experimenting and finding ways to make Discord more useful. We know how much hard work goes into hosting community events. Some of you have been asking us for a way to make it really easy to host a paid event — like a special meet and greet, a class on financial literacy, or even tutoring. Along with Stage Discovery, we’re starting to test paid tickets for your extra, extra special audio events. It’s the first feature where you’ll be able to earn money through Discord, and it’s in private beta for now while we learn how to make it great for everyone. And, our most requested feature — Threads — is coming to Discord this summer, which will make text chats even easier and more streamlined so you can go down those rabbit holes whenever you want. You heard it here: Threads. Are. Coming. On our sixth birthday, as we see over 150 million people using Discord every month, we feel a tremendous responsibility to continue making Discord a safe place. We’re continuing to invest in Trust & Safety while adding tools to help support communities of all shapes and sizes. Just last week we introduced a new exam as part of our Moderator Academy . Also, a special shout out to all the community moderators and admins out there who help keep their servers safe. We’ve been hard at work on these changes and hope you like them as much as we do. As we get ready for another trip around the sun, we’re excited to bring these new features to you as soon as we can. Look out for the “Imagine a Place” campaign coming to a big (or little) screen near you. — Jason & Stan Imagine a Place 474 15 Company 474 claps 474 15 Written by Founder/CEO @Discord Discord is the easiest way to talk over voice, video, and text.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "happy blurpthday to discord a place for everything you can imagine", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/happy-blurpthday-to-discord-a-place-for-everything-you-can-imagine-fc99ee0a77c0", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Discord has become a place to call home to over 150 million monthly active users around the world to talk about everything from sneakers, to the deepest details of their favorite game soundtrack , to virtual car meetups and late-night study sessions. Just under a year ago , we outlined the work we’ve done to welcome the world to Discord, no matter what your interests may be. To help, we also wanted to make our overall look and feel just as welcoming to the world as the ever-improving in-app experience and help everyone enjoy Discord just a bit more. So, welcome to Discord. Again. Our current logo has stuck around with us since the beginning of time itself… as in, since we first launched Discord in 2015. A lot of people aren’t aware that the little smiley icon in the Discord logo has a name: Clyde. Most people call him Discord, Mickey Mouse pants, a game controller, and of course, ugly. :( Most of the time, you’ll see old Clyde within a rounded rectangle chat bubble. Technically, being inside this bubble is Clyde’s “home”. Whether it’s on our website, within a profile icon on our social pages, or inside the app icon on your computer or mobile device, Clyde was always “in” something, like a hamster stuck in a rolling ball. Only the most eagle-eyed may notice, but the old logo was horizontally asymmetrical — something our Design Team’s been waiting years to fix. Small details such as “Clyde lives within a bubble” and “not symmetrical” can be deceivingly restrictive when creating new interface elements, art assets, and even merch items. So, we took a step back and thought to ourselves: How can we give Clyde a refresh without going too crazy? And what makes Clyde, well… Clyde? It took a while for us to land in a good place — people around the world are already familiar with the Discord logo, so we can’t have them wake up one day seeing something weird like a banana as our icon. Below is a preview of all the ideas and experimentation we went through when determining how Clyde should look. We went from lots of circular shapes to what’s basically a :) and eventually refining the more squared-off shape that you’re seeing today. We’ve also freed Clyde from being stuck in his bubble, and he’s very excited about it. In fact, you might even see Clyde smile. Or be a bit sad. Or sleepy. A good amount of fan art depicts Clyde with expressions, but now we’re officially letting Clyde feel what he needs to feel. If you take a peek at the top of Clyde’s head, you may notice the old antennas look a bit more like shoulders now. We realized that sharp little antennas didn’t translate well when printed on different types of materials, or when printed on really small surfaces such as a pin. In the end, we believe changes to Clyde present him in a more friendly tone, reshaped to be more understandable whether smaller or larger, all while still keeping our pal looking unique and familiar to the most veteran of users. All these smaller details, improvements, and new options add up to a fresh new look for years to come. Alongside the refreshed Clyde, you’ll also see an updated Discord wordmark, which is a fancy way of saying “the font used to spell out ‘Discord’” — it’s a custom font based upon “Ginto” that we created to go with the new Clyde logo. We explored hundreds of different fonts before landing on this very unique font face that we believe captures the playfulness of Discord. We even tweaked some elements of the font and letters so it’s easier to read than how it originally was. The biggest thing that we debated, changed, changed back, changed back again, agonized over, and might have even had serious anxiety about was whether we should keep the wordmark in all caps or in title case. Once something is finalized and the world sees, there’s no going back, and that includes how things are capitalized. In the end, we decided that Title case — making sure it’s always capitalized like someone’s name — made our new wordmark more legible. Although you won’t often see the wordmark used on its own, it does look beautiful. Good ol’ Blurple: Just like Clyde, Blurple is in every corner of Discord. It’s not exactly blue, not exactly purple… but it’s definitely close to our hearts. All of our older colors were a bit on the pastel-y side, along with our cleverly-named shades of Grey including… “Greyple,” “Dark, but not black” and “Not quite black.” With a new logo comes a brighter, more saturated Blurple: below is our new Blurple, right alongside the new Clyde and our new wordmark so you can cohesively see the new look : Internally, we first used this new color “blurple_5_plus_adjustments,” but that didn’t quite roll off the tongue as well as Blurple did. The lighter color of Blurple will forever be known as “OG Blurple.” We wanted to bring more energy to Discord for our entire color palette by brightening up the colors to be more bold and playful. Along with refining many of the existing colors with a brighter hue, we’re bringing a bit more variety to the color palette by introducing a new color: Red. You might recognize some of these colors — they’re inspired by application features that you’re likely familiar with on Discord, such as Online, Away, and Do Not Disturb status messages. And while pink isn’t a direct correlation to an in-app color, it’s as equally playful and fun as the rest of ‘em. It’s a bit more lively. A little bit brighter. And hopefully, a bit more like home. You can see the entire set of new colors over at discord.com/branding . When we say our new palette is inspired by using Discord on the day-to-day, that doesn’t mean these colors are strictly for our website or blog. When you open up Discord next time, things might feel a bit brighter. We’ve got our logos and colors, along with some new typography and art on the login and registration pages. Once you’re logged in, the changes will be more subtle. New Clyde will be welcoming you on the top-left, just as he always has, and all the colors will be just a bit bolder. New typography will appear within certain headings throughout the app, but the majority of the headings and fonts will stay the same as they are today. As the year goes on, you may notice additional updates here and there, such as changes to illustrations in empty states and tooltips — we want to make sure they’re perfect first. Discord has become a place for millions around the world to create art , to karaoke nights and sharing plant care tips , speculate about cryptocurrencies, and on occasion, accidentally fall asleep because you’ve been up too late on voice. When figuring out our new styles, we connected with over 26,000 members of the community to ask what Discord means to them. We got your feedback and direction on style, colors, and even the way we talk about Discord. Your feedback and guidance also helped us make sure our new colors are still readable in both Dark and Light themes. It’s your influence that helped guide us while making changes both big and small, and we’re so grateful to have such dedicated and creative members of our community. We’re super excited ( and just a tiny bit nervous ) to unveil our new look today, on our 6th birthday. Around all our websites and social profiles, you’ll see a new phrase: Imagine a Place . Imagine a Place is our new mantra that brings to life the fact that Discord means so many different things to so many people around the world. It’s a creation and collaboration with the community that we are proud of, and we hope you are too. After all, that new place you’re imagining on Discord? It’s what you make of it. Today’s just the beginning. Head on over to our YouTube channel where we’ll be celebrating our birthday with style. We’d love it if you stopped by to celebrate our new look (and birthday!) with us. Our new look was crafted with your help, and we’d love your thoughts on how it turned out. You’re always welcome to shoot us a tweet at @discord . If your feedback doesn’t fit within a tweet, our feedback forum is always open . There’s a lot more plans on the horizon. We’re glad you’re with us on this journey. ❤ Unfortunately, we aren’t able to publish blog posts in multiple languages here.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "celebrating aapi heritage month with our community", "author": ["Fiona Tran"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/celebrating-aapi-heritage-month-with-our-community-b80d29b2ddd7", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Hello, everyone! My name is Fiona (she/her), and I’m part of the Asian American & Pacific Islander Employee Resource Group (ERG) here at Discord. It’s a space within the company where AAPI community members and allies can come together to make our workspace, and the world outside of our (digital) office walls, a better and more inclusive place where we can live our mission of creating space where everyone belongs. For AAPI Heritage Month, we reached out to a few of the many Discord community leaders, business leaders, and musical artists within the Asian American & Pacific Islander community to give them a chance to tell their story and inspire AAPI communities and allies across the world. “I went to preschool and kindergarten as one of three Asians at my school,” says Grace Ling, founder of the Design Buddies community. “It was hard to fit in.” From an early age, Grace found it difficult to find someone who could empathize with her experiences. Growing up singled out by her peers, the daughter of a mother from Taiwan and a father from Singapore, her story was unlike those of the people around her. That’s part of why she turned to blogging at an early age, writing posts that shared her life experiences at 16 and sharing them with the internet at large. “It helped me own my story and make others feel validated about their experiences,” she reflects — although both came at the cost of unwanted attention in the form of trolling and cyberbullying. It would not be the last time Grace would take control over her own narrative, nor the last time others would push back against her for it. When she turned 22, she made the fateful decision to divert from her engineering background and pursue a career in product design. She met resistance almost immediately, but it didn’t stop her. “My professors told me to ‘stay in your lane’ and not do design, but I wanted to prove them wrong.” She got her wish. One year of hard work and dues-paying later, Grace had landed a full-time job in a competitive industry where credentials and connections can make a huge difference. She was no longer an outsider…but it didn’t always feel that way. The online design communities she joined didn’t always make someone with no formal design education feel welcome. She wanted a more open community oriented around all levels of interest and experience: a “wholesome place to talk about design.” After searching in vain, it was clear she’d have to make one. She founded the Design Buddies server on Discord. A year later, her community had expanded to over 21,000 members. We host 10+ events a month to try to include everyone’s interests and levels of experience in design. We also have an events team to keep everything running and also hold events in different timezones. Our types of events include socials, workshops, presentations, panels, work/study sessions, interest club meetings, and more. The response to Design Buddies was overwhelming. The positive messages she gets from community members on a daily basis testify to how much you can change someone’s life with inclusiveness. Grace Ling didn’t just take control of her story…she helped thousands more do the same. After a shooting in Atlanta that took the lives of six Asian women, Dave Lu took things into his own hands and composed an open letter to the world with the title “Enough,” and had it signed by over one thousand Asian American business leaders. To get it into the world’s view, he took a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal, showing his demand that AAPI hate come to an end and committing to raise $10 million to put a stop to it. Since then, over 7,000 additional signatures have joined in the movement called StandWithAsianAmericans to fight for equity for AAPIs in the streets and in the workplace. Dave points out that many AAPI members have been awakened from the past year of violence and trauma. “At first, many of us were afraid and confused, but now we are mobilized and determined to make sure we are heard and recognized. Share your stories with others because they deserve to be told and will have an impact.” Find your voice. Change the narrative. This is our time to finally take a stand. We have been told for too long to be silent and keep our heads down. That time is over. We were fooled into a false sense of security that Asians are doing just fine in America, but now we know that isn’t true. And if someone isn’t ready to take a stand on their own? “Be vocal on behalf of your AAPI colleagues and friends,” implores Dave. “It means more to them than you know when an ally steps up on their behalf and takes a stand. We need more allies to show support for our community so that others will follow.” “Reach out to people in the AAPI community and find out ways you can volunteer to keep them safe from physical harm but also check on your AAPI friends mental health during this difficult time.” As a first-generation ABC (American-Born Chinese), Kelly has faced her own challenges. While her hometown of Chicago is a diverse city, she nonetheless found herself in a school system without many other Asian students. Her identity was a source of tension that was hard to escape. For a while I was ashamed of my Chinese identity because my clothes, my food, my language, and my culture were seen as weird. But because I was immersed in American culture and spoke English as my dominant language, the Chinese community views me as American. I think that a majority of ABCs live in this in-between area, where we’re not completely accepted by either side. Although this shared struggle can unite ABCs, even those who grew up in radically different environments, finding them in your local area can be challenging. “Living in central Illinois, I don’t have a single Cantonese friend here,” Kelly explains, “so it’s been really hard to celebrate my culture.” That’s why she decided not to let geography get in the way of her heritage. She founded a Discord community called Subtle Cantonese Traits that connects people of Cantonese backgrounds all over the world. It serves as a central hub, a way for members of a diaspora to unite across geographic boundaries. “I think my experience growing up without a strong sense of pride in my culture made me want to make this a priority for the server. If you don’t feel like you fit in wherever you live, I want you to feel like you’re home with us on the server.” For members of the Subtle Cantonese Traits community, the shared experiences that make them fit in less in other places create a place where they belong more than anyone else: a place to brush up on language and customs that keep them apart from other Cantonese people worldwide. Nothing illustrates the bond this creates better than the New Years party held remotely between Cantonese people worldwide: “It was very heartwarming to see that people chose to spend their new year eve with their internet friends on the server, and we had several rounds of countdowns for people in different time zones.” Because no matter where you are on the map, you should always feel at home. As a first-generation, Asian American woman growing up in the early 2000s, I struggled to see people of color on mainstream media,” says Joleen Hsu, the co-founder of gifting platform and community-building enterprise untold . This dearth of voices and representation from marginalized communities motivated her to make a difference — which meant lending her business acumen to a new kind of platform. A business for distributing ethically-sourced gift items, untold seeks out, promotes, and empowers the efforts of BIPOC-owned businesses. Their mission is partly about giving these businesses the support they need to succeed in an environment stacked against them, but it’s also about learning from them. “My work is inspired by the neverending journey to understand the unique experiences of different communities and celebrate their identities,” Joleen explains. During the summer of 2020, at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, and as small businesses were shutting down across the US, I felt a strong calling to help promote businesses from communities of color. untold’s mission is to create meaningful experiences by promoting BIPOC entrepreneurs and their brands to build a more socially and environmentally inclusive economy. Our care packages are experience-based gifts that highlight artisanal and sustainable products, with the intention of sharing every brand’s unique story. Joleen’s commitment to sharing the stories of others doesn’t end there. With her co-host Josephine Cheng, she started The untold Podcast : a platform for interviewing BIPOC entrepreneurs, directly platforming them as businesspeople and members of marginalized communities. “It’s especially fulfilling for me because it embodies everything that I stand for: vulnerable and honest dialogue that sheds light on new perspectives.” Which is part of the point: when you give strength and voices to people who are often denied it, everyone benefits. Along with Grace, Kelly, and Joleen, we had the opportunity to chat with songwriter and rapper MC Jin, who collaborated with Wyclef Jean to create Stop The Hatred, a song dedicated to raising awareness to the recent spike in anti-Asian hate crimes in the US. When asked to explain what he does, MC Jin breaks it down to the fundamentals: “I put words together in rhyme form over dope beats.” That’s a simple way to express a delicate art — a turn of phrase characteristic of Jin’s virtuoso style. When he sets out to express something, he doesn’t mince words. MC Jin is the first Asian-American solo rapper to be signed to a major US label. A chart-topping trailblazer, he’s had hits both overseas and domestically. This pan-coastal track record speaks to his dual sense of identity, a complex relationship woven throughout his career. The truth is none of us get to decide where we’re born, when we’re born and in what environment we’ll ultimately find ourselves as we are shaped as individuals. I love that culturally, I can connect with my Chinese heritage. At the same time, being born and raised in the states, I do feel an equal connection here as well. Not that it’s a new sentiment, but we are living in a time where it’s more clear than ever, there are some groups that may not feel this way. Simply put, to them, based off of our skin color or features, we don’t belong here, but we are boldly and proudly saying, “This is our home.” As MC Jin is well aware, this is not a uniquely Asian-American problem. As a rapper with Chinese heritage in hip hop, MC Jin sees firsthand the tensions between his own community and Black individuals. It’s not always pretty, but there’s power in confronting it, something MC Jin doesn’t shy away from. True solidarity means being able to acknowledge that although there has been tension and conflict in the past between the two communities, we can still find healing through dialogue, understanding and having empathy for each other’s plights as it pertains to discrimination and hatred. He backs his sentiments up with action: “I myself was extremely encouraged and inspired to not only witness, but be able to speak at one of the first ‘Asians For Black Lives’ rallies in NYC last year. I will say though, on both ends, beyond posting on social media or showing up for a march, I hope that we can continue to see the humanity in each other.” More recently, MC Jin has collaborated with legendary artist Wyclef Jean to produce a new track, Stop the Hatred , addressing the rise in violence against members of the Asian-American community. Their partnership is the culmination not just of both of their careers confronting racial divides, but of their own long-standing professional relationship. “The fact that he produced my first single ‘Learn Chinese’ close to two decades ago makes our collaboration this time around so much more meaningful and timely. The challenge, more so something I’m processing on my own, is remaining mindful of the unfortunate reality that this song is being born out of pain, hurt and tragedy.” As a personal relationship with the piece, that’s understandable. It’s not a challenge listeners will face, as the lyrics speak poignantly and frankly about love and suffering both. I’m blessed to have a platform to express my personal experiences and sentiments as an Asian-American. Especially with songs of this nature, I think it’s important for the message to be sincere. The ultimate goal would be to spark a change in the hearts and minds of people across all communities that we need to unite and come together, especially during these current times. It’s a dream that can always come true — as long as there are people willing to fight for it. We also spoke with Bao Nguyen, director of the Stop the Hatred music video . When Bao Nguyen first read the lyrics to MC Jin and Wyclef Jean’s “Stop the Hatred,” he was visited by visions of Chinatown — past and present. It’s that legacy of hope, struggle, and community that he captures as the director of the anti-racism single’s acclaimed music video, juxtaposing grainy archive footage with shots of modern youth and activists. Growing up in a multiracial area outside of Washington, DC, Bao feels privileged to have experienced from an early age how groups with unique cultures and experiences nonetheless share a common humanity. He also saw how these groups struggled in similar ways, and how these struggles were made worse by divisions between them. “I’ve learned that for those on the edges of society, our struggle and pursuit of equity and justice is inextricably tied to one another. It cannot be seen as a transactional relationship but rather one of true reciprocity.” The stories of Yuri Kochiyama with Malcolm X , Bruce Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Grace Lee Boggs are examples Bao looks to as great examples of Black and Asian solidarity. In each of these relationships is a basic level of mutual respect, of regard for one another. It’s an attitude embodied by one of his favorite cultural traditions, one observed by many Asian families worldwide: the act of taking off one’s shoes before entering a home. It really comes down to the respect that we are showing others. Although it is now second nature to many of us, it is an act of intention. To take off one’s shoes and place them carefully next to the doorway, it is our way to symbolize our consideration. I don’t want to oversimplify or make a gross generalization here but perhaps this respect for entering a neighbor’s home explains why many of our parents and grandparents have kept their head down when entering their new homeland. And in this action of keeping their head down, perhaps it was never a sign of docility and meekness that we thought but instead a show of reverence and respect of this place we now call home — America. In talking about the future, Bao is excited about the AAPI community standing up and becoming more vocal about their grievances and the racism they experience. “We have been talking this whole time but no one has been listening. But with the future generation, we are making sure that we are heard which is a powerful thing to witness.” That’s why Bao’s doing his best to turn up the volume. Regarding his work directing “Stop the Hatred”, Bao explains that while the song was birthed from a moment of anguish, its message is ultimately uplifting: he wanted the music video to capture both of those feelings, and felt there was an important symbolism in having the music video be filmed in settings of joy and celebration that have been decimated by COVID-19. It was equally important to make the music video a portrait of the community: not headlines and statistics of AAPI individuals facing tragedy, but human beings. To young BIPOC artists and creators, Bao offers the following: Be unapologetically yourself and be HONEST. Don’t self-censor yourself to cater to a certain mainstream audience. If you are fortunate enough to be in a place that you have agency and power over the stories you can tell, ask yourself if you are the right person to tell that story. If you are not, try to build the spaces and lanes for those stories to be told from a person who should be telling that story. These are just a few of the millions of stories out there in the world. If you’re unsure how you can help, we shared a blog post in March of this year titled Resources Against Hate and Discrimination Towards the AAPI Community . It includes organizations and nonprofits that work to stop anti-Asian hate in the world. Alongside these community leaders, I also talked with a few of the AAPI Employee Resource Group members at Discord. You can read their stories on their own dedicated blog post here . Behind the doors of Discord and throughout our communities, we will continue to support each other by celebrating our differences and relating through our similarities. We hope you take the time to celebrate AAPI identities this month and throughout the year. —Fiona Tran, Graphic Designer at Discord Imagine a Place 111 Community 111 claps 111 Written by (she/her) graphic designer @ discord / organized chaos lover / https://linktr.ee/fionakimtran Discord is the easiest way to talk over voice, video, and text.

Every parent knows how children are drawn to technology. They’re growing up in a society defined by computers, a world where every kid dreams of becoming a streamer or making a groundbreaking app. It’s inevitable that they’re going to spend a lot of time around devices. The important thing is helping them get the most out of their natural curiosity and creativity. Enter Kano , a London-based developer of educational technology. They make computers, peripherals, lessons, and programming kits that let young people master tech skills in fun and intuitive ways. To find out how Discord helps them in their mission of bringing technology to everybody, read on. Kano is out to deliver what every parent wants for their kids: “the good kind of screen time.” They offer everything a curious child needs to learn about tech, one lesson at a time, until they’re designing custom apps on a computer they built themselves. That means giving parents access to more than just lesson plans and kits: it means offering them a warm, inviting community to help their family along on its journey. “We felt inspired by conversations with some of our customers who asked about having a community of parents to chat to about different topics,” said Team Kano. “Also we knew from our user base on Kano Club that some young adults/teens wanted somewhere to chat about the latest Kano had to offer.” After all, no matter the skill level, every engineer or programmer needs someone to bounce their ideas and frustrations off of. That meant a place for organic free-flowing conversations, which, for Team Kano, meant Discord. “Most of us had used it before in our personal lives for chatting and gaming with friends, so we knew the interface.” Those less familiar are greeted with several channels explaining the server, its roles, and basic Discord features. No matter what your level of tech expertise, the community is waiting to help you take your first steps. As soon as new users are oriented, they’re met with a well-structured array of channels. Some of these are straightforward, like the ever-inviting general chat, but there’s also a lot of thought that went into structuring channels deeper down the list. In addition to a product feedback channel, there are channels specifically for parents and teachers to introduce themselves, learn how to use the server, and share photos of Kano in action. By offering separate places to talk, Kano not only helps similar users find one another, they get a chance to see how these demographics have different experiences with their products. Team Kano understands that a community server is very much a two-way street: as you help them, they help you. “For us, our Discord community is our roots. They give us support, they give us advice and they allow us to grow.” Treating user feedback as a way to start a conversation gives them a chance to seize opportunities, fill in gaps, and explore improvements they would have never considered themselves. When a community is thoughtfully organized and maintained, everyone wins. “Every brand needs a space where their customers and fans can hang out. What I love about Kano is they’ve built a home here for their community to not only talk about Kano products but have conversations around other topics that are relevant to the brand from teacher-tips to parent-101! It allows Kano to be closer to their customer and for customers to feel valued as part of the brand’s phenomenal growth story.” Amber Atherton, Head of Branded Communities —Discord Of course, the server isn’t just for talking shop: parents are happy to come by just to celebrate their child’s achievements. The gallery and moodboard are full of photographs of proud young creators, working away on machines they built and put together. Team Kano couldn’t be more thrilled. “We love to see these action shots and often use them on our socials to show off our community!” All in all, Kano has gotten a lot of good out of the community they’ve created. “We don’t want to be a scary tech brand who doesn’t talk to their customers apart from via a bot. Discord allows us to be that with our customers. Our brand messaging is all about being transparent with technology. Through this transparency, we want to communicate with our audience on a personal level. This is where Discord is perfect.” The good kind of screen time? Sounds like it to us. If you’re interested in connecting with the Kano community yourself, you can find them here. Are you a parent or teacher wondering if Discord is a good place for your younger ones?

{"website": "Discord", "title": "celebrating aapi heritage month with our employees", "author": ["Fiona Tran"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/celebrating-aapi-heritage-month-with-our-employees-731a33e1b9b2", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Hey again, everyone! Fiona here — alongside our Community-focused AAPI Heritage Month blog post , we also wanted to give some of my fellow AAPI teammates and company leaders at Discord a chance to share their own experiences and stories. Alix Sharp is a bonafide multi-talented rockstar at Discord. On the Customer Experience team, she offers top-notch support and guidance across the community. Within the company, she’s a member of the AAPI’s ERG and one of the leads of the Pride ERG (for the LGBTQ+ community). Both positions see her working hard day in and day out to make sure people’s voices are heard…but for Alix, it’s only the beginning. Having spent most of her life in Japan and Hawai’i, Alix is fluent in both English and Japanese. That’s a skill she leverages in her very own community: HonYaks Video Game Localization (“honyaku” being the Japanese word for “translation”). HonYaks offers translation and localization support among peers across the entertainment industry and has been expanding to even more industries around the world. As one of the leaders of the Yak Pack, Alix believes that understanding the cultural context is a crucial goal when it comes to localizing content. “Being able to translate is one thing, but to truly research, get the context behind the intent of the translation then executing it is a logic puzzle. If [you] do the puzzle just right, everyone will see a masterpiece.” It’s incredible that Alix balances these already daunting positions with a college workload. Not only is she a full-time student, she’s involved in the actual student government: a representative of her campus’ STEM community. It’s a lot to have on your plate, but it’s that same drive which pushes her to juggle a full-time job, a translating community, a full course load, and both leadership and membership in multiple activist causes that makes her such an invaluable part of Discord. As she puts it: ”Being the agent of change in the time that the world is hurting by being a proactive advocate for my peers is something that’s fulfilling.” The challenges Alix sets for herself are daunting. But no matter what she comes up against, she finds the strength to push on. “Don’t ever give up. Move forward, no matter what. Pick people out of the shadow and into the light.” Kelly Liang leads Discord’s Business Development efforts and her team’s mission is to invest in strategic partnerships that further Discord’s vision to create space for communities and for everyone to find belonging. Growing up in the US however, that sense of belonging didn’t always come easily to her. Kelly admits that she wrestled with her Asian American identity and bi-cultural upbringing. While she loved being multilingual, foods like dumplings and sesame rice balls, and celebrating cultural holidays, she was also aware of not quite being able to fit in — whether it was because of her physical appearance or feeling self conscious when her parents met her friends and spoke in broken English. Just recently, my daughter shared with me the song called ‘Stand Out Fit In’ by One OK Rock,” Kelly reflects. “Listening to the song lyrics reminded me of the inner conflict that I too often felt in my youth, the desire to ‘stand out’ and achieve from my humble beginnings but also wanting to not draw attention to myself to avoid exclusion or ridicule. Nowadays, Kelly actively embraces and takes pride in her AAPI heritage. In both professional and social settings, rather than forcing herself to be a “culture fit” in each situation, she finds herself asking how she can be a “culture add”. It’s still not always the easiest path but she chooses to push forward and lead by example. One of my favorite quotes that I embrace deeply is: ‘Staying in your comfort zone doesn’t make your world safe, it makes your world small.’ This is advice that I wish I could have shared with my younger self whenever I came upon a crossroad between a “safe” choice and one that seemed daunting and uncomfortable. The good news is that I now have two young daughters with whom I’ve been able to relay this piece of advice! Kelly wants the world to understand just how much the AAPI community has contributed to and shaped the history of the United States. She asks that allies take the time to listen to and amplify underserved voices. When you see something that is hateful or hurtful, say something and do something. It’s never too little…and never too late. “I want to be remembered not for what I said or what I did, but how I made people feel,” Kelly explains. “I’m proud (and extremely grateful) for my deep friendships, my strong network of supportive and talented colleagues and my loving and patient family. It’s these friendships and relationships that I most cherish. They have given me the strength to be able to lead, the humility to find ways to give back as well as the privilege to pay it forward.” When he was growing up, Operations Support analyst Michael Lee explored what it meant to be a first-generation Vietnamese immigrant in the United States. Fitting in meant learning when it was socially acceptable to present as “Asian” and when to present as “American”, identities that were rarely allowed to coexist. In between those two realities, the American upbringing and Vietnamese heritage, was Michael. Fortunately, it’s a choice he has to make less often nowadays. “I’m learning that it’s safe to celebrate my Vietnamese roots. I spark new friendships over shared experiences we had growing up, like spilling fish sauce where it doesn’t belong or tasting our first moon cake.” Things that were barriers to fitting in have become the foundations of brand-new friendships. It’s meant that Michael’s been able to truly celebrate one of his favorite holidays: Tết, or Lunar New Year. One of the biggest holidays in Vietnam, the New Year is always accompanied by big family get-togethers and celebrations. One tradition during Tết is gifting children (or anyone not married) lì xì, also known as red envelopes , meant to welcome good fortune into their lives. Michael loved using his lì xì money to buy the latest Pokemon game, which in itself is worth celebrating. These red envelopes evoke memories of Michael’s smiling family, all gathered in one place, putting away mountains of food, and growing up faster than any of them could realize. One of their family’s biggest wishes is to see them both with college degrees. With Michael’s brother Bryan getting his degree this upcoming year, they’re about to make that dream a reality. It represents the beginning of a new chapter for his family and their traditions. Be kinder to yourself, you are worthy. Give yourself the kindness you need to grow and extend that kindness to those around you. The ones who send it back are worth sticking to. You’re going to be just fine. With Michael’s newfound confidence to celebrate his heritage and culture, he implores the rest of the AAPI community to do the same. “Speak up with us. Talk to us. Many of your friends are still trying to find our voices after decades of silence. Hear us out and validate our experience, our grief, and pain. Defend our elders, our families, when they are attacked anywhere. Challenge toxic generalizations about the AAPI community and stand beside us when we stand up against harm.” As Vice President of Operations, Steve Lin manages our Customer Experience, Operations Support, and Workplace teams, and is also the executive sponsor of the AAPI ERG. Whether you need a hand from our incredible support team or you’re an employee developing Discord itself, Steve’s leadership is behind every interaction. Steve’s proud of his AAPI heritage, but it wasn’t always a large part of his life. He grew up in an area of Ohio where there were few Asian families to connect with. People would ask Steve superficial questions when trying to learn about his family, with the most frequent being along the lines of: “Are you good at math?” and “Do you know karate?” It wasn’t the most respectful way to learn about another person’s culture, but Steve acknowledged there was a lot he didn’t know either. That’s what motivated him to be more curious about the people around him, learning more about their beliefs and practices. “As a child, I always found it fascinating to talk to students from all over the world, learn about their culture, and try new foods.” It’s why one of his favorite family traditions is celebrating Thanksgiving. With a lot of Steve’s extended family living far away, his father, a professor, would invite a handful of his expat graduate students to the family Thanksgiving dinner. Turkey, stuffing, his mom’s Chinese home cooking, and homemade dishes from guests flooded the tables as everyone happily ate and learned a little bit more about each other in the process. It’s this upbringing — the openness and kindness to those around him, the interest in the stories of others — that leaves the biggest impression on people. Steve recalls how someone recently shared with him that he was “an inspiration to them because it was their experience that nice people get eaten alive in the tech and games industry but the fact that I’m a good person and a successful executive gives them hope.” That’s just the feeling Steve hopes to share with the AAPI community. If you are in a position to do so, open up doors for those that are underrepresented. Work to help remove the unconscious bias that surrounds the AAPI community, particularly around ideas like the model minority. Join us in calling out acts of violence against those in the community and racist dog whistles by those who look to separate rather than unite. That thing that scares you or you don’t think you’re ready to do? Give it a try. You’re going to mess up, badly in some cases, but none of it is going to be the end of the world and you’ll look back on it as a valuable learning experience. If this feels like a workspace and company culture you’d love to be a part of, check out our Jobs & Careers page — we’re always working to make Discord better for everyone, so come build belonging with us. We also released a blog last year specifically for those who are preparing for an interview at Discord, which you can read right here . As a reminder, these are only half of our interviews celebrating AAPI Heritage Month. We’ve also interviewed community leaders, business owners, and musical artists who celebrate their heritage and traditions in their own unique ways, so be sure to check out that blog post as well. If you’ve made it this far, thanks so much for reading. Behind the doors of Discord and throughout our communities, we will continue to support each other by celebrating our differences and relating through our similarities. We hope you take the time to celebrate AAPI identities this month and throughout the year. —Fiona Tran, Graphic Designer at Discord Imagine a Place 53 Community 53 claps 53 Written by (she/her) graphic designer @ discord / organized chaos lover / https://linktr.ee/fionakimtran Discord is the easiest way to talk over voice, video, and text.

The exam covers a wide range of topics from the growing library of Discord Moderator Academy articles and will test your prowess in all things moderation. Discord is a special place because of all of the amazing communities where people find those with similar interests, form friendships, and create belonging. These communities are built and cared for by moderators, who make sure these servers grow and flourish while making sure the community held within is healthy and safe. The Discord Moderator Academy (DMA) was created to empower those moderators to lead more effectively, manage teams, and learn more about the tools needed to help foster their communities. DMA is a collection of resources written by moderators of some of Discord’s most prominent communities. The amount of content continues to grow, now consisting of over three dozen articles carefully crafted by moderators across the platform, each bringing their expertise on a wide variety of different challenging topics. We built the Moderator Academy as a comprehensive resource so anyone, from first-time mods of smaller servers to experienced veterans of massive online communities, can find resources to learn about moderation, community management and more. Those who pass the DMA Exam will be eligible to apply to join Discord’s growing moderator ecosystem of communities — users 18+ can join the Discord Moderator Discord (DMD), while users between the ages of 13–18 can join the Teenage Moderator Discord (TMD). Both of these servers are a growing community of passionate moderators on the platform to discuss all things moderation. As the center of community moderation for Discord, both servers foster discussions about community moderation, leadership and administration, and server development on Discord. Discuss all things moderation, product features, Trust & Safety and Policy, and more. You’ll find the platform’s best moderators, bot devs, scholars and researchers, and even Discord engineers and product managers, Trust & Safety members, and policy experts. They’re people who help imagine, build, maintain, and grow the most amazing communities on the platform, and the internet as a whole — and you can be a part of it all. In Discord’s moderator servers, moderators build connections with each other, showcase community accomplishments, offer their own moderation opportunities, seek out help with challenging moderation issues and learn about moderation tools. You can even step back and think about what it truly means to be a community moderator by discussing moderation philosophy, hypotheticals, and the practicalities of community management. There are regular meetings about moderation on Discord, sneak peeks at upcoming Discord features, and the chance to hear from teams across the company on what they’re working on. You can even help offer ideas for product features — we’re right there to listen. When you’re ready to be tested, the exam is accessible from any article within the Discord Moderator Academy. We recommend reading through all the articles before taking the exam — take some time to find a quiet spot and set aside an hour to take on the exam. You can also find it here . The exam consists of multiple-choice questions, as well as short answer questions on hypothetical situations, moderation policy, as well as some questions about your moderation experience and the communities you moderate. Completed tests are hand-reviewed by our Trust & Safety team, so make sure it’s in good shape when you hit submit. We wish you the best of luck on the Moderator Exam! 📝 Imagine a Place 262 9 Policy 262 claps 262 9 Written by Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "celebrating earth day across the planet", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/celebrating-earth-day-across-the-planet-ca170d0037ec", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Tons of nature enthusiasts have found belonging and community on Discord through their shared passions for wildlife, plants, and the great outdoors. From cultivating houseplants and critters to connecting ecologists and zoologists around the world, we’re excited to see so many nature-based servers thriving and celebrating our Earth this month. For this special edition of the Community Spotlight, we reached out to a handful of outdoor-loving servers to ask about the unique communities that they’ve built, and how they’re celebrating Earth Day. Read on below to see what they’re all about, and maybe you’ll be inspired to help your local environment in your own way! Alex, also known as “Bug Brood” or simply “Brood” runs Critter Corner, a server dedicated to all things crawly, from arachnids to beetles, crustaceans, and “herps” (that’s the fancy word for reptiles or amphibians). Members can expect to find topics about raising their critters, breeding, ecology, and of course photography of any and all invertebrates. Established out of a desire for a well-managed, lighthearted community centered around respect, positivity and education, Alex is proud that his hobby evolved into a place for all enthusiasts to stay in touch (especially thanks to a welcome committee) and establish long-term friendships and reputations in their areas of interest. “There’s nothing better than growing a small sized group of people into a large one and seeing everyone interact and be happy with each other! Not to mention it’s about one of my favorite subjects!” The server has members worldwide and wants no one to feel left out by allowing members to self-assign roles for their country, animal interests, and pronouns. For Earth Day this year, Critter Corner is hosting a photography contest and offering special roles for those cleaning up litter in their local area. If there is anything that Canada has a lot of, it’s nature. In fact, Canada contains 9% of the entire world’s forests . Nick, the owner of Canadian Outdoors & Prepping, originally started the server as a disaster preparation community after noticing a lack of Canadian-specific ones. Since there’s a lot of overlap between disaster preparation and the outdoors, the server shifted its focus to cover topics like backpacking, hiking, canoeing, medical, communication, and gear reviews. Members across both Canada and the globe now ask questions, share answers, and post plenty of photos from their outdoor adventures. With such a diverse background of outdoor adventurers, Nick and the other members ensure that new members feel welcomed and able to ask questions about nearly any topic, from hiking to forestry and more. “One of my favorite moments is seeing members helping each other out with issues and concerns without hesitation. If someone new comes along with wanting to get into hunting, all they’d have to do is ask in the #hunting discussion channel and our members would be glad to offer tips and information on how to get started.” In celebration of Earth Day, Canadian Outdoors & Prepping is hosting a cleanup contest to encourage folks to pick up trash and consider the impact of litter in their communities. Marcel is one of the fantastic folks behind the Houseplants! server, which is all about — well, plants for your house! The server is full of tips, advice, and hype for “every new leaf” . Membership grew (pun intended) this past year with lots of folks looking to make their homes more lively. The team puts a huge focus on fostering positive interaction and does not tolerate any kind of elitism. To the Houseplants community, it doesn’t matter if you just moved into your first apartment and bought your first succulent or if you’ve been collecting plants for many years. “O ne of my personal favorite (reoccurring) moments is when community members decide to do an impromptu stream of their plant care routine in our voice channels. Quarantine has been hard for many of us, and being able to return to normalcy by just hanging out and getting a glimpse into other people’s daily lives has made many of my days a lot better!” The entire moderation team prioritizes actively participating in all channels along with members as part of the community, getting to know members like friends. If you’re a new member and decide to say hi, you can be sure one of the community members is going to welcome you and ask you a bit about your current or future plant journey. For Earth Day today, the Houseplants community has three days packed with events, giveaways, and educational talks from soil scientists, conservationists, and a wide variety of other horticultural experts. Give ’em a search in Server Discovery if you’re looking for a place to root yourself in. Serving as a semi-casual hub for professionals and enthusiasts of ecology, the aptly-named “Intellectual Minds of Ecology and Zoology” is a home for everyone interested in those two fields of study, regardless of their experience or skill level. Kam, the server owner of the Intellectual Minds of Ecology and Zoology server, says they originally didn’t have any friends or family that worked or studied in the two wildlife sciences. “I wished I had a way to talk to professionals regarding their careers and aspirations. I realized that Discord could provide an amazing platform to build this type of community that so many people, like me, could benefit from.” Now, Kam runs a community of fellow enthusiasts that just recently celebrated reaching the 1000 member milestone. Members new and old are encouraged to assign themselves roles that showcase their favorite ecological interests, personal pronouns, geographic region, and more. Today, the community is planning to make a “nature collage,” where members can pitch in with nature-themed photos or artwork they’re most proud of, and the mod team uses the submissions to form a collage. The community also plans on having one of their members, who is a Conservation Officer, present their career work and discuss how it ties into the meaning of Earth Day. Even after over a year of running the community, Kam says they’re still surprised by the sheer number of new members who have joined the server in such a short time. “[Earth Day] is very important to us as a server and we hope the community enjoys these events and appreciates the significance of the day.” Mavrik Joos runs the Mav server, a one-stop-shop for people (especially fans of their YouTube channel! ) looking for advice, sharing memories, and getting more involved outside. Getting into a hobby like fishing or camping alone can feel intimidating. A lot of people who watch Mav’s content are interested but don’t have the resources or a place to ask questions so Mav created the server as a judgment-free space for outdoor enthusiasts where everyone feels comfortable to ask questions to them and other members. “It’s nice to see people come together with similar and much different interests at the same time.” Since Mav’s content is based around vehicle camping, there are many fans of truck camping who post pictures of their rigs and talk shop in the #vehicles channel. Take a peek and you’ll see hatchbacks in the wild, camper trucks, and traversing weather of every season! For Earth Day, Mav is putting together an event where community members can post videos and pictures of them picking up litter for a chance to win prizes. There might even be a guest speaker talking about the importance of keeping the earth clean and leaving campsites better than how you found them. Kevin runs The Great Outdoors, a server focused on anything and everything outdoor recreation. Common topics include camping, hiking, backpacking (particularly long-distance and ultralight), rock climbing, cycling, snow sports, boating, and archery. Like most people, Kevin originally joined while looking for help planning a big trip. Upon entering, it was immediately obvious that this group had something special going on. Over the next few months, they enjoyed many great conversations, joined the staff, were promoted twice, and eventually became the server owner — although Kevin says “I’m just a caretaker.” The Great Outdoors welcomes new members as they join with a channel for people to introduce themselves and let everyone know what they’re into, which almost always strikes up a conversation. Many members join to ask questions about going camping for the first time, and the server helps them to learn and enjoy nature, allowing them to finally accomplish their outdoor goals like going on their dream hikes. “Every day is Earth Day here! We’re big proponents of Leave No Trace , which is a set of principles that help you minimize your impact when outdoors. It’s our duty to protect nature, both for the well-being of the nature itself, and for future generations to enjoy.” Thinking about starting a server for your outdoor (or indoor) interests? Check out our articles on Starting Your First Discord Server and Best Practices for Starting a Great Community on Discord . Today, like many of the server owners we talked to, we at Discord encourage you to do something nice for the planet, whether that means picking up a quick piece of trash, or making a donation to a charity like The Canopy Project to help reforest the planet. You can find education and lots of events around the world over at EarthDay.org . Happy Earth Day! Imagine a Place 69 1 Community 69 claps 69 1 Written by Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "starting servers on discord is easier than ever", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/starting-servers-on-discord-is-easier-than-ever-1038bc6170f5", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Discord is chock-full of tools and features that can help servers and communities of all sizes be their best. Whether you’re making a server with just your closest friends, or are looking to start a larger community focused around professional frisbee golf, there’s plenty of ways to structure your server just the way you’d like. The biggest hurdle when starting your first server is, well, how do you get started? While we’ve recently written not just one , but two blogs about this exact question, our teams have been improving the server creation process within Discord itself. It’s one thing to tell people how easy it can be — it’s another to actually * make * it easier for everyone. We’d like to share the changes that we’ve introduced recently that help to improve your day-to-day experience using Discord: from role and channel creation, to improving the usability of bots for everyone, and even some smaller tasks like making private channels. Roles within your server are like those stick-on name tags you scribbled who you are on. They help your community know all sorts of things, such as who the moderators are, what your interests or pronouns may be, or even help separate who should be notified for @Important News and who should be informed when someone posts @Dog Pics in the #pet channel. (Although one could argue that @Dog Pics and @Important News are the same thing.) However, setting up your roles on mobile isn’t nearly as easy it should be. What sorts of permissions should Moderators or Members have? Do you really have to set up permissions all over again on every role? And how do you even assign a Role within the Roles page? (Spoiler: you couldn’t.) To help, we’ve done a visual overhaul of how Roles are created on mobile . You can easily name a role, assign it a color, and even give it some predetermined permissions — four Role templates help you decide whether someone should be a Moderator or just make sure that the @Dog Pics role can’t delete any cat pics. If you’re making your server’s first role, you’ll even be given a guided tour through the creation process. And yes, you can finally assign a Role on the Roles page. No need to juggle between the Roles page and the Members page to make sure you gave someone the right permissions. What IS a bot? You can think of bots on Discord like an app for your server. They can help expand the functionality of what’s possible on Discord in all sorts of ways —everything from providing additional moderation capabilities to helping run polls and pulling off board game nights with your friends. Some even offer on-demand puppy pics if you’re having a ruff day. However, knowing what a bot is *actually* capable of doing used to be a bit of a hassle. Some of the more popular bots have their own websites, while others require you to type “!help” each time you want to see what you’re able to do. Or was the bot’s command “?help”… or “.help”? Was it even called “help,” or “!support” or “!commands?” Your guess is as good as ours. Needless to say, a guessing game isn’t a great experience if you’re still new to bots on Discord. To help, we recently launched Slash Commands to more easily surface everything you should know about that meme-posting bot you just added, with a simple press of the “/” key. No need to refer to an external guide on how to use a bot, or trying to give your friends a lengthy tutorial and watch them fumble over trying to use the right !command. If you have multiple bots on your server, you can even select a bot on the left and jump straight to that bot’s command list — especially helpful if multiple old-school bots use the same “!help” command. Looking for a great bot to get started? Below are some of the most popular bots on Discord, already ready and waiting for you to send some Slashes their way: Moderation bots: Dyno or MEE6 Music bots: Groovy or Rythm For fun: Dank Memer or Airhorn Bot From #general to #memes, #cat-pics and #dog-pics, and even #shoebills if you’re into that kind of bird, channels of both Text and Voice variety are home to conversations of all kinds. But sometimes, there might be a topic of conversation that not everyone wants to gain access to. While #cat-pics and #dog-pics are generally considered adorable by the world, #huntsman-spider-pics is probably not nearly as beloved. To help, we’ve made the process of creating private channels within your server much more clear and understandable . When making a channel, choose the Private Channel option, select which Roles and Users you want to give permission to access, and you’re good to go. You can even toggle whether or not a channel is private within the Channel’s settings page, as seen below: Gone are the days where you need to fumble with channel permissions and hop between menus to see who gains access and see if it actually worked. You’ll know exactly who you chose gets access to the channel, and the beginning of the channel’s chat history will show the avatars and roles of those who can see the channel. Pro Tip: The Members list always displays those who have access to the channel. If you don’t see a particular friend on the right, they can’t see the text channel you’re currently reading. All these improvements are beneficial to existing communities, but if you’ve never started or even joined a server, how will you be able to enjoy all these changes? Whether it’s your first server ever , or you’re about to make your tenth server about your favorite variant of mustard, starting it up shouldn’t be difficult. Now, we’ll do all the heavy lifting. Just tell us what your server’s about and who it’s for, and you’ll be given not only a new server but a few starter channels to help kickstart the conversation. Perhaps you’re looking to start a server where your university friends can get together , or a community focused on discussing the intricacies of video game soundtracks . Whether it’s just a few of your friends, or you plan to bring tens of thousands together on common ground, you’re not making just another server on Discord — you’re creating a new home for everyone. Together, we’ve made Discord a place where anything is possible. And now, creating and managing that same place is easier than ever. In need of a bit more advice? We’ve created a handful of blogs that can guide you from humble beginnings to reaching new heights in the Discord Partner Program. Check out the following blog posts for additional guidance, no matter what your plans are for your server: Starting Your First Discord Server Best Practices for Starting a Great Community on Discord Fostering a Thriving, Partner-Worthy Community on Discord And, if you have ideas of your own about things that could be streamlined or easier to use, we’d love to hear from you. Our Feedback Forums are always open to any suggestions you’ve got, and we’ll continue to improve and make the Discord experience better for everyone.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "slash commands are here", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/slash-commands-are-here-8db0a385d9e6", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Last year, we announced the Future of Bots on Discord . Setting the stage for the work to come, we shared our investment in bots and in supporting more features for the developers who build them. We want to show bots off to the world, and our first step towards that vision was our Verified Bots program: we’ve now verified over 9000 bots, and we couldn’t be more impressed by everything you’ve made. Our next step is Slash Commands, which will dramatically increase bot accessibility as well as improve the overall user experience of bot interactions. Until now, everyone using a bot on Discord has interacted with them in the same way: text commands, where a user must type (sometimes guess) whatever the exact command for that bot needs to be in order to work. Often, it might look something like this: Bots can add an incredible amount of value to servers, and we know they are as important to Discord as text chat, voice channels, gifs, and emojis. That’s why we wanted to make them just as easy and intuitive to use. With Slash Commands, now all you have to do is type a slash “/” to bring up a list of commands that can bot can do! This means not only will users now be more aware of all the available commands for your bot, but they will also see new functionalities as you add them. In addition, we’ve implemented validation, error states, and helpful UI to ensure they can get it right the first time, especially on mobile (you now have one more ally in the fight against your phone’s autocorrect). The implementation of Slash Commands also helps increase accessibility — people who use screen readers and other helpful settings will be able to use your bot as easily as they navigate the rest of Discord since Slash Commands are built-in. Our community library developers have done an incredible job in helping to make the Discord API more approachable. We want to help make coding on Discord even easier, too. When we started making Discord bots, we all found this kind of “getting started” example: Wow, that was easy! But as we built more, we realized it’s not always that simple. Before long, that 10-lines-of-code bot running on our home PC became a monolith of abstracted command handlers and docker configs as we desperately googled “How to increase memory on a VPS” and “What Discord gateway intents do I need?” Our goal with Slash Commands is to create a user-friendly way to talk to bots, built on top of a powerful, developer-friendly framework that takes away the burden of some of those software struggles. Slash Commands come with built-in type validation and argument handling. You can define arguments, types, and even custom options. You no longer have to worry about checking if an ID is a user or a channel — or teaching users how to get IDs in the first place — or creating an elaborate system of fuzzy-matching names so that moderators can pick between banning Mason#1337 and Máson#1337. Need a user? type 6: USER . Need a channel, role, integer, or string? There's a type for that. Your bot has a /play command, that other bot in your server has a /play command. Every bot has a /play command. Eventually, we're going to run out of ! , ~ , and - to tell one command apart from another, and what happens when three bots get the same command? Because bots receive Slash Commands as specific events and not by reading chat messages, you and your users can take the guesswork out of what bot a command is supposed to be. Autocomplete helps users search for and filter all commands on a server, meaning it’s easier to find your /play command and not someone else's. For those of you running large Discord bots, you know that hosting, uptime, and scalability aren’t free. Gateway connections can be expensive to maintain, and rolling out new code means eating into your IDENTIFY limits for the day. While Slash Commands work over the gateway like any other event, you can choose to receive them as outgoing webhooks instead. Responding to Slash Commands is also done with webhooks with unique tokens per interaction, meaning you can respond to users immediately instead of waiting for your send_message rate limit to be up. And, when you have new code to deploy, you can simply restart your webserver instead of reconnecting hundreds of shards. It’s time to let you in on a secret: we implemented a whole new kind of API right under your nose. Slash Commands are one of many up-and-coming features built on top of a new part of our API that we call “Interactions.” These are events triggered by users interacting with your bot — they’re standardized and separated from any individual feature or UI element (in other words, we can build a whole lot more than Slash Commands, and you get to reap the benefits with little additional work). Interactions are accessible over both the gateway and outgoing webhooks, meaning that if you don’t need a persistent gateway connection, you don’t have to maintain one. “But wait, how do you have a bot without a gateway connection?” Great question! What if you didn’t need a bot? You can read more about how bots and interactions work together here . We’re still hard at work making more interaction-based features for you. We’ll be keeping a close eye on how you all use them, and as always we love to hear from you. Slash Commands are live on Desktop, Android, and iOS. Head over to the API documentation and learn about making Slash Commands for your app right now! If you’re looking for some inspiration, check out what some of your favorite bots have already done so far: Dyno Groovy MEE6 Rythm Dank Memer … Airhorn Bot !?

This blog is an overview of what the Community Team at Discord considers the best practices and guidelines for any community looking to grow its strongest on Discord. We’ll cover how to get your server ready to launch, ways to keep everyone excited for what’s next, a more in-depth look on how you can host AMAs on Discord, and how to moderate your community effectively. No matter where your story begins, there’s one thing you’ll need to do that’s crucial to starting a new community: marking your server as one! You can do this by heading into Server Settings > Community and going through the setup process. Once you designate your server as a Community server, you’ll unlock a ton of new features for your server designed to help as you scale up. This includes the following features: Welcome Screen : Set up a personalized welcome screen for new visitors of your server so they know what your community is about and where to begin. This way, they can immediately jump into the right channels without feeling lost. Announcement Channels : Announcement Channels allow you to broadcast messages beyond your server. Users can “Follow” your announcement channels and receive published updates directly to their own servers. Stage Channels : Share audio conversations involving a small group of participants with up to 1000 community members listening in. Members can ask to be brought up to the stage and join in the conversation for all to see. Membership / Rules Screening : Rules screening allows you to set up rules that new members must explicitly agree to before they can talk, react, or DM other members. Server Insights: Server Insights provides information about your server that can let you know how your community is doing. Is it healthy? Are people talking? Do your newest members stick around, or do they leave soon after joining?? Server Discovery : You can display your community directly on Discord’s Server Discovery — no more having to advertise somewhere else to attract new users! The requirements to join Server Discover are shown inside Server Settings and may change occasionally. As you go through the setup process, you’ll be required to enable some extra safety features. This includes requiring every member to have a verified email before they can post a message, and enabling an explicit media filter to make sure image attachments are suitable for a server that anyone will be able to join. You’ll also be offered a few optional toggles, such as setting your server’s Default Notifications to Mentions Only . Newly-created Discord servers start with notifications set to all messages, which means every time someone posts any message, they’ll be notified about it. As your community starts getting bigger and bigger, it can get tiresome to get notified of every message. We recommend turning this on to get ahead of the curve, as disabling these notifications within your server settings won’t retroactively disable it for existing server members. Now that you have it all set up and ready to welcome new members, the real work begins: maintaining a community that people want to be a part of. As your server grows further, it’s important to keep everyone excited to be a part of your community. People from all over the world join communities on Discord because they want to be a part of something more, and you and your moderation team are what make it possible. It’s good practice to regularly take a step back and ask the following questions: What are ways that you can bring excitement to your community and give them a reason to stick around? What makes your community unique compared to the others, and how can you capitalize on that spark? The types of activities that can fit your community can vary depending on what your server’s about. If you’re an artist or creator, consider having collaborative art or feedback sessions where community members can share their own creations they’re proud of. Events like this help your community build more intimate connections with each other — nobody likes to be another face in the crowd. What if you’re not as artistically inclined? The idea of collaboration isn’t limited to art — these ideas can easily transfer to video game or book reviews, coding, beauty tips, and a ton more. If everyone’s gathered to your server for a certain reason, they’ve likely got plenty they want to share with like-minded individuals. When you’re thinking of things to do with your community, remember that you don’t have to stick with events solely within your server’s theme . You might join a hiking server to talk about hiking, but that doesn’t mean hiking is the only thing you do. (Unless hiking 24/7 is really all you do, in which case, that’s impressive.) As time goes on, you’ll eventually start to recognize that group of regulars who frequent your server and liven up the day, but server owners or moderators should interact on a regular cadence as well! It’s important to not only show the community that you have invested in them but show that you’re along with them on this journey. Your community is here because of you. That doesn’t mean you have to always post 24/7, but by posting frequently, running an event, or even looping in the community on updates regarding the server itself or subject your server is about, you’ll help make everyone feel like they’re part of a great community. As your community starts to grow, making sure the server remains a welcoming environment is crucial. To help keep things safe, it’s best to have a team of moderators to help assist in keeping the server running smoothly. But who do you choose to help? When you’re looking to add new mods to your team, we recommend recruiting from the most active community members , rather than outsourcing “experienced moderators” from outside your server, or your closest friends. Having familiar faces within your mods team helps everyone know that not only is your community closely connected, but those same people are here to help if needed. Additionally, every community should have a pre-written set of rules to abide by. Where the rules live was specified when you enabled “Community,” since it’s a requirement to turn it on! Think about the type of community you want to run, and craft the set of rules accordingly. By having your rules posted in a public channel, you’ll help alleviate any possible confusion or misunderstanding and give your team a good set of tools to moderate efficiently and transparently. Taking the time to connect with your community is crucial for success. Holding events such as game nights, small karaoke sessions in a voice channel, or competitions helps foster a community that wants to collaborate and interact with each other. One of the more complex events that happen within servers is an AMA, or “Ask Me Anything.” These are live interviews that take place within a voice or text channel. If you’re looking to hold an interview within your Discord server and aren’t sure how to tackle it, here are a few of the best methods we’ve seen: For live audio AMAs , we recently released an entirely new type of channel to help: Stage channels . Stage channels allow you to share a focused conversation with select individuals to an audience of listeners, and it just happens to be perfect for interviews or AMAs. Community members who want to hop in the conversation can even ask to be allowed on the stage, and your team of moderators can help them up. However, you’ll also want to make sure the questions asked are okay to talk about. To help gather questions for your AMAs, consider setting up a form that allows members to submit questions beforehand . Once everyone’s questions are gathered, you can pick the best questions to be asked during the session. This is the easiest and has you be the most prepared in terms of moderation, but the community might not feel like they’ve contributed as much as they’d like if they can’t see the questions ahead of time. If you aren’t into using forms, you can instead have members post their questions in a special text channel on the day of the event with Slow Mode enabled. Enabling Slow Mode will require members to wait a certain amount of time before posting again, anywhere from five seconds to a whopping six hours. As users post their questions publicly, you can choose which ones to answer during the interview. As we mentioned in our last post , people come from all sorts of different corners of the world, but no matter the distance, they can get together on Discord and talk about anything, with anyone. Your community is one of the many homes where people connect and make long-lasting friendships — the work you and your moderators do can potentially impact their lives in ways you could never imagine. Should you be unsure on how to grow your moderation skills to help your community going strong, we recommend checking out the Discord Moderator Academy , an ever-growing resource of knowledge to help elevate your moderation game, both within your community and others you may be helping out with. Those who are aiming to one day have their community join the ranks of the Discord Partner Program can check out our final blog in this series, Fostering a Thriving, Partner-Worthy Community on Discord . If this was a bit too advanced for you, we also have a post for beginners titled Starting Your First Discord Server if you’ve never started one before.

With more people using Discord, features such as Voice channels started being used in more unique ways than ever before. Music festivals moved from concert halls to voice calls and physical conventions moved to a virtual environment, hosting their panels within voice channels. With all the local karaoke bars closed, your own Discord karaoke nights probably got a bit more crowded. As more and more of these bigger audio-centric events pop up, we realized that it can be difficult to manage organized audio events within voice channels. Currently, you’d have to juggle things such as what permissions users have, what roles someone might have that override said permissions, and any channel-specific permissions overriding * those * permissions just to get everything ready to run your voice event… needless to say, it can be a lot! Just as we’ve made improvements to video chat and running communities within the last year, we’d also love to help make it easier to run audio-centric events. It’s your time in the limelight with the newest addition to your Discord server: Stage channels . Stage channels are a new type of channel available for Community servers that allow you to share a focused conversation with select individuals to an audience of listeners. Now it’s easier to understand who’s the focus of the conversation and who’s waiting for their turn to speak. Stages can be especially useful in situations where you’re running events within your server such as voice AMAs or interviews, reading clubs where each person talks about their book of choice, or just singing the night away in karaoke. No more having people talking over each other thinking it’s their turn or that long awkward silence before someone goes “…oh, am I up?” Within each Stage, Stage moderators are here to help manage who’s speaking and can add, remove, or mute an existing speaker. Think of them like a stagehand, keeping everything running smoothly behind the scenes while you’re talking to the crowd. Audience members can also participate by “raising” their hands during an event if they want to speak. Stage moderators can then help them up to the stage whenever they’d like and then move them back to the audience afterward. When you’re ready to try out a Stage channel, you’ll first need to enable Community on your server, found within Server Settings > Community. You can get the whole scoop on how to set the stage over at our Help Center . Whether you’re in the spotlight or in the audience, Stage channels are here to help bring everyone just a bit more closer together for audio-centric events of all varieties. It’s not often we introduce a whole new type of channel into Discord — we’re stoked to see what sorts of crazy ways you utilize Stage channels. Stage channels are currently live on all platforms that Discord is on: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and your browser of choice via the web app. If you’re doing something really rad within Stage channels, send us a tweet at @discord and show us the ways your community is coming together.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "discord transparency report july dec 2020", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/discord-transparency-report-july-dec-2020-34087f9f45fb", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com 2020 was a year of rapid growth for Discord. We felt honored to welcome many new people to our platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. Discord Trust & Safety worked hard in this time to keep pace with the growing user base. The team was able to respond meaningfully to an increased number of reports while maintaining proactive efforts to keep the highest-harm actors off the platform. We also sought to advance online safety in new ways by forming closer industry partnerships and by investing in community resources like the Discord Moderator Academy . Today we’re pleased to bookend our reporting on 2020 with information on the second half of the year — between July 1st and December 31, 2020. This Transparency Report iterates on the work we have done previously and expands the scope of the information we’re making public. We are for the first time detailing the number of servers warned for violations of our platform rules, the number of child-safety issues flagged to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), as well as the number of requests we received from law enforcement, and the rate at which we complied with legal process. In December 2020 we announced that 140 million monthly active users were finding their place on Discord — up from 100 million in June 2020. We saw alongside the expanding user base a progressive month-over-month increase in user reports of violations of our Community Guidelines . This growth was not caused by a significant change in any one category but rather owes to an overall upward trend in reports across all categories. Trust & Safety received a total of 355,633 user reports in the six months between July and December 2020. This represents an increase of slightly over 50% from the first half of the year. The team was receiving slightly under thirty thousand reports each month in the months before the COVID-19 pandemic. Monthly totals at the end of 2020 ballooned to well over sixty thousand — nearly forty thousand more per month than at the start of the year. The pie chart above represents the number of inbound user reports Trust & Safety received in the second half of 2020. The totals in this chart do not represent confirmed instances of violations of Discord’s Community Guidelines but rather the number of reports of content. We’ve maintained the groupings from our past Transparency Reports and broken out three new categories: Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) , Extremist or Violent Content , and Self-Harm Concerns . These three, previously grouped elsewhere, make up comparatively small portions of the overall report volume, but they represent some of our “highest priority” categories and therefore merit separate tracking and reporting. CSAM in particular now stands separate from Exploitative Content. The category represents child-harm content or behavior — while Exploitative Content groups together sexually exploitative or otherwise inappropriate content. It should be noted that Exploitative Content is itself distinct from general not-safe-for-work (NSFW) imagery. General Harassment continued to be the most frequently reported issue on the platform. Cybercrime contributed the second-highest number of reports in the period — with its total reports increasing nearly 250% from the first half of 2020. CSAM and Extremist or Violent Content, which tend to be some of the highest-harm issue types, were reported much less frequently, each contributing slightly greater than one percent to total volume. Trust & Safety uses the designation “actioned” when they have confirmed a violation of our Community Guidelines and followed up with some action. This can involve an account or server warning or deletion, a temporary account ban, a removal of content from the platform, or some other action that may not be immediately visible to the person submitting the report. The table above shows that the most harmful issue types generally tended to have higher action rates by Trust & Safety. This may be partly explained by the team’s prioritization of issues in 2020 that were most likely to cause damage in the real world. Trust & Safety continued to ensure that reports on high-risk categories were reviewed and resolved in under two hours. Our approach to content moderation involves taking action proportionate to level of harm. Account deletion is generally the most serious action that Trust & Safety can take at the user level. Users may be removed from Discord either for individual violations of our Community Guidelines or if they are part of high-harm groups that break our platform rules. Deletions are permanent unless the user appeals with additional details about the circumstances of their ban. Spam continued to contribute the highest number of raw deletions of any category. Trust & Safety and our anti-spam tools removed a combined total of 3,264,655 accounts for spammy behavior in this period. Much of our efforts in the second half of 2020 involved not only account deletions but proactively blocking or stopping spammers at registration. The Spam total has been excluded from the graph above because it is so much higher than the other deletion totals. We removed 266,075 non-Spam accounts in the second half of 2020 for violations of our Community Guidelines. Exploitative Content continued to account for the second-highest number of bans after Spam. CSAM and Extremist or Violent Content, while accounting for comparatively small portions of overall report volume, each contributed high numbers of account deletions — a result of our efforts to proactively remove this content from the platform. Trust & Safety may remove a server from the platform if it is dedicated to behavior or content that violates our Community Guidelines. The most harmful of these groups are frequently deleted with members. We may additionally remove a server for repeated minor violations of our Community Guidelines or if moderators are not compliant after receiving server-level warnings. Trust & Safety removed 27,410 servers between July and December 2020 for violations of our rules. Deletions for Cybercrime and Exploitative Content were most frequent in this period. Server deletions for Cybercrime in particular jumped nearly 140% from the first half of 2020. This tracks with the marked increase in reports — more Cybercrime spaces than ever were flagged to Trust & Safety, and more were ultimately removed from our site. While Exploitative Content is slightly lower than in the first half of 2020, it is only because we previously reported CSAM as part of that category. Looking at the two categories together for the second half of 2020 shows that the total number of deleted servers is in line with the first half of the year. Deletions in almost all the other categories rose in the second half of 2020. The only exception came in Hacks and Cheats. Both the number of reports and deletions for this category dropped significantly from the first half of the year. Hacks and Cheats did, however, remain one of the more common reasons for server removal in the period between July and December 2020. We continued to lean into using warnings as a way to course-correct users and servers responsible for less severe violations of our Community Guidelines. The decision to employ a warning over permanent deletion is generally only made if little harm results from the behavior and if the context suggests a violating party has the potential to reform. While some users and servers continue to violate Discord’s rules after receiving a warning — and are later deleted — the majority are able to continue on our platform without the need for further intervention. Trust & Safety issued 28,170 user warnings in the second half of 2020 as well as 3,999 server-level warnings . We do not issue warnings for CSAM or Cybercrime at either the user or server level — and we also do not warn servers for Hacks and Cheats or Self-Harm Concerns. Violations in these categories are generally severe enough to warrant immediate deletion. Discord does not allow content that sexually exploits children. Users found to be uploading such content are reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and removed from the platform. All child-harm material is subsequently purged from Discord. We also frequently investigate and report higher-harm cases of grooming or endangerment. We reported 6,948 accounts to NCMEC during the second half of 2020. This figure represents distinct accounts reported and not the total number of reports submitted. The majority of our reports were for child sexual abuse images flagged by PhotoDNA hashing software. Trust & Safety reviews all flagged images and reports confirmed instances of child-harm content. These totals are represented as “Media reports” in the graph above. Another 83 of our reports were for higher-harm grooming or endangerment situations. Trust & Safety thoroughly investigates all cases that could result in immediate harm to a minor. We partner closely with NCMEC to ensure that time-sensitive escalations receive prompt attention. We continued to invest in resources in the second half of 2020 to proactively detect and remove the highest-harm groups from our platform. Most of Trust & Safety’s proactive efforts went towards removing spaces sharing Exploitative Content and Violent Extremist groups. Included in the broad category of Exploitative Content are two subcategories: Nonconsensual Pornography (NCP) and Sexualized Content Related to Minors (SCRM). SCRM is distinct from CSAM here in that these spaces may sexualize minors in less explicit but still violating forms. We proactively deleted 1,919 Exploitative Content servers in the second half of 2020. While we were able to delete slightly more NCP servers in the second half of the year than in the first, the number of proactive SCRM deletions decreased — for the first time ever sinking below the number of reactive server deletions. It should be noted, however, that overall SCRM deletions remained higher than the number of deletions for either NCP or Violent Extremism. We were disappointed to realize that in this period one of our tools for proactively detecting SCRM servers contained an error. There were fewer overall flags to our team as a result. That error has since been resolved — and we’ve resumed removing servers the tool surfaces. We also worked in the second half of 2020 to take action against militarized movements like the “Boogaloo Boys’’ and dangerous conspiratorial groups like QAnon. We continue to believe there is no place on Discord for groups organizing around hate, violence, or extremist ideologies. Trust & Safety proactively removed 1,504 servers for Violent Extremism in the second half of 2020 — nearly a 93% increase from the first half of the year. This increase can be attributed to the expansion of our anti-extremism efforts as well as growing trends in the online extremism space. One of the online trends observed in this period was the growth of QAnon. We adjusted our efforts to address the movement — ultimately removing 334 QAnon-related servers . Users who have been removed from Discord are given the option to write in to Trust & Safety and appeal the action that was taken on their account. We review user appeals and may reverse a decision if new details about the ban are presented or if we discover a mistake was made in our work. Trust & Safety will not engage with appeals that present safety concerns. We received 82,166 non-Spam user appeals in the second half of 2020 — up from about 70,000 in the first half of the year. These users were each looking to reverse one of the 266,075 deletions issued by Trust & Safety. We reversed our decision in 3,937 cases — translating to an unban rate of about 1.5% . We granted an additional 3,061 appeals for users deleted for Spam. Provided below are three sample cases to better illustrate how Trust & Safety approaches the ban appeals process. Identifying information has been removed to respect user privacy. Trust & Safety deleted a user’s account as part of a larger takedown of servers involved in targeted harassment and incitement of violence. The user publicly commented about the ban on other social media platforms and were advised to write in to our support queue. Result : Our reason for removing a user or server from Discord may not always be immediately clear to the public. Trust & Safety closely reviewed this user’s ban appeal and confirmed their violation of our Community Guidelines. We decided not to reinstate the account. Trust & Safety deleted a server with all members for promoting extremist ideologies. A user impacted by the ban wrote in explaining why they were in the space. They claimed they were studying online radicalization and clarified that they had not promoted extremist ideologies. Result : We investigated and confirmed that the user did not present a risk to Discord. Trust & Safety reversed the ban but warned the user that they should not engage in this behavior. We do not allow extremism — and we advise that all users report potentially dangerous spaces. A user wrote in to Trust & Safety after receiving a warning and one-day temporary ban for making threats. They recognized the reason for the warning and pledged to be more respectful. Result : We do not generally suspend temporary bans. Trust & Safety felt that the one-day ban was proportionate to the level of harm, and they informed the user that they would regain access to the account the following day. The user was at that time allowed to return to Discord. Discord has a legal obligation to respond to valid United States law enforcement requests seeking information on users who may be the subject of criminal investigation. All pieces of legal process undergo strict scrutiny by our Legal Operations team to make sure they are legally sufficient. Discord may challenge requests that are unclear, overbroad, or not legally valid. We received 3,662 total pieces of legal process in the six months between July and December 2020. These numbers include the requests we received through the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process. Discord currently requires that all legal requests from non-US government agencies be issued through proper MLAT procedures. 3,401 pieces of legal process were found to be valid — meaning they were issued and signed by a legal authority, and also provided enough information for us to identify a user. Discord may disclose user information to law enforcement without legal process in cases of urgent threat to life. Law enforcement can follow these steps if they believe there is an emergency with one of our users that could result in death or serious physical injury. We do not disclose user data to law enforcement absent legal process unless we have investigated and confirmed a good-faith belief that physical injury will result without our action. We received 325 requests for emergency disclosure from global law enforcement in the six months between July and December 2020. We made disclosures in 122 of those cases. We either were not able to identify or did not disclose information on users in the remaining cases. We’ve benefited enormously in the past six months from forming closer partnerships with industry leaders, government agencies, civil society groups, and academics. We joined the Trust & Safety Professional Association in an effort to expand professional development for Discord’s Trust & Safety team; and, alongside Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Pinterest, and Reddit, were a founding member of the Digital Trust & Safety Partnership. We partnered with the Technology Coalition, the Family Online Safety Institute, and ConnectSafely to reinforce our commitment to preventing child abuse online. We also joined Tech Against Terrorism and the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism to expand our ability to identify and remove violent extremist groups from our platform. We’re looking forward to deepening these partnerships in 2021 and entering into others to help advance online safety. We view these biannual reports as valuable opportunities to share information on company operations that directly impact our users. It is our hope that the increasingly clear, granular data presented here will help paint a fuller picture of the work we are doing to keep Discord safe. Trust & Safety is working hard in 2021 to make sure that all user concerns receive swift and appropriate responses. The team is also continuing to invest in methods to proactively detect abuse — so our users are shielded from harmful content. We’re additionally hoping to empower moderators by investing in resources like the Discord Moderator Academy. We’re excited to rise to the challenge of tackling content moderation at scale.

You’re used to it by now — when a topic gets more in-depth, your friends make a new group chat for that subject. Or perhaps you’re used to something else: your friends who talk as much as eight chats can hold, but all within *one* conversation, which makes catching up on the chat a job in itself. Maybe you’re in the middle of one of these situations, or you know someone who could use good ol’ organization in their conversations. Or, you want to help guide a friend through creating their own Discord server! This blog post will be around to help both you and your friends get off the ground, whether it’s learning how to make a server for the first time, showing how helpful a Discord server can be to many different types of groups, or explaining what a server even is. So, let’s get started! If you’re looking for the textbook definition of a “Discord server,” it’s a place on Discord for groups of all sizes to talk in. But that doesn’t explain what makes a server special. Think of it like this: A Discord server is like when all your best friends gather at your home to hang out. Sometimes a few are talking about the latest episode of their favorite show in one room, while others may be discussing a hike they adventured on over the weekend. Everyone talks about different things, but no matter what conversations go on, you’re all there for one reason: you’re long-time friends who’ve been together through thick and thin. In fact, that’s what a lot of Discord servers are about — people come from all sorts of different corners of the world, but no matter the distance, they can get together on Discord and talk about anything they’d like, with whoever they want. So let’s get you set up with your own Discord server, where your friends can talk to your heart’s content without feeling lost in the many conversations going on at once. First thing’s first: download the app for your computer or smartphone at discord.com/download . Alternatively, you can access Discord on any computer you can use a web browser on, without having to download an app, at discord.com/login . Once your account is set up and you’re signed in, you’ll see a green + (Plus) button on the left side of the app . Choose that, and you’re on your way to making a new home. You’ll then be asked what the server’s about. Depending on what your answer is here, you’ll be given a different set of starter channels to talk in. More on what channels are later. In the example below, we’ll use the “Friends,” template, but feel free to pick which one works best for you. Next, the most important part of any server or group: The name. No matter what our friend group chats about, we all have one thing in common: we love houseplants. Let’s call it… “Plant Pals.” If anything ever happens or you’ve left the houseplant lifestyle for greener(?) pastures, you can always change the server name and icon later on . Aaand you’re done! Your new home for you and your closest friends is ready to roll. But it’s missing something important… your friends! Now that you have a new space to move into, it’s time to get your friends to join you. Right in the middle of the chat window, you should see a big “Invite Your Friends” button . Hit that, and you’ll see the option to either invite your friends directly or share an invite link. If it’s not there, you can always invite friends through the invite button in the server’s drop-down menu on the top-left , as shown in this example below: After inviting friends and sharing your invite link, soon everyone will be gathered in your shiny new server. In your new server, you’ll see a few lists called “Text Channels” and “Voice Channels.” These are where you and your friends will be talking in all sorts of ways. Text channels behave similarly to how you may send messages on other platforms. They’re where you send messages to your friends, share photos, files, or one song stuck in your head. You can even type out someone’s using name starting with an “@” and they’ll be notified, such as “@Fern.” Every channel has a name associated with it and holds its own chat history. You can think of a channel name as the conversation topics for that channel. For example, in a text channel named #general, you’ll talk about anything and everything that’s on your mind, while a channel called #plant-talk could be best suited for showing off that newest ficus. By default, when you make a new channel, everyone will be able to see and post in it. It’s like making a new group to talk in, without having to re-add everyone all over again like you would in a normal Group DM. Voice channels are part of what makes Discord special. Remember when we compared a Discord server to having all your friends over? Voice channels are what make this possible. Click on a voice channel and you’re placed in a room to talk with your device’s microphone. Unlike Direct Messages, users in a server won’t be startled by a ringtone when you join the voice channel. It’s like walking into a room with your friends and joining their conversation! Voice channels also allow you to use your device’s camera to see your friends for a video chat. You can also share your device’s screen to show your friends how good you got on that one game, or how complex your plant watering schedule is. You can have an unlimited amount of people in a voice call at once, and up to 25 people video chatting at the same time. Up to 50 people can watch someone’s shared screen. When we made our “Plant Pals” server, the “Friends” template we used included channels called #general, #gaming, and #music. Since we’re big into houseplants, our friends want a place where we can focus on talking about and sharing tips on taking care of our plants. So, let’s make a channel for that! To make a new channel, head into your server’s drop-down menu on the top-left and select “Create Channel”. It’s the same menu you used to make an invite! If you’re on mobile, slide to the right to open your channel list, tap the server’s name and choose “create channel.” From there, a menu pops up letting you customize your channel. We’ll be making a text channel for this, so choose “Text Channel” and give it a name. Let’s keep it simple and call it “#plants.” Aaaand that’s it! A new place has been planted to talk about your ferns, fauna, and flowers to your heart’s desire. When creating more channels, it’s best not to get crazy with the channels — if you’re just starting out with your server, you’ll want to get a feel for how your friends use them. To keep things comfy without overwhelming others, we recommend starting off with a small number of channels and adjusting your channel selection as time goes on . Let’s think about our new #plants channel: “plants” itself is a pretty broad subject that can result in many different topics within that to discuss. Certain conversations, such as “what pot should this fern be in?” will likely be talked about, answered, and moved on after a short period. There’s no need to make a whole channel called #what-pot-should-this-fern-be-in. Servers can be pretty flexible — you can always add a new channel when you want , and you won’t have to reinvite your friends each time you make a new channel. You can also delete channels when you don’t need them anymore, but once a channel deleted, everything within it is gone for good . Be sure to make 100% certain you want to delete the contents of a channel before it’s gone — sometimes keeping an unused channel around is better than deleting it outright. Sometimes, as the owner of your snazzy new Discord server, you may want to keep certain channels only visible to a few friends. When it’s time for your friends to talk about how insects can be beneficial to your garden, some of your friends may be a bit averse to suddenly seeing pictures of snails, spiders, and slugs. To help, you can designate a channel to be only a Private channel, only accessible to specific members and roles you decide. Roles can be pretty powerful tools for larger servers, so for now, we’ll stick to specifying exactly who we want within our small friends server. As you’re making a channel, you’ll see an option to make a Private channel . Toggle that on, and hit Next. From here, specify who should see the channel, and hit “Create” Channel! You’ll see a brand new channel pop up, and if it’s a Text Channel, a list of the members who can see it. If someone ever wants to be added or removed from a private channel after it’s already made, you can right-click on the channel (or long-press on mobile), select “ Edit Channel ” and head to Permissions, which is where you can adjust who can see that particular space. Now that you’re all set up in your server, go on and have fun! Hang out in a voice channel, post adorable photos of cute pets next to your growing ivy plant, or wave hi to each other in a video call, no matter where you may be. Your server is what you make of it. If this blog post was helpful to get yourself off the ground, or you want to explain what makes a Discord server so unique to someone, we encourage you to share this blog post with anyone who could benefit from this. You can also leave a comment if it really helped! Sometimes, what was originally planned as a small server can grow to be much bigger than anyone expected. If your server is growing to the point where you’ll need more guidance, we plan to release another blog post (very soon!) on what we consider the best practices for growing communities on Discord — we’ll link it here when it’s out. And of course, if you have any more in-depth questions, our Help Center is always available, along with our Twitter page. Shoot us a Tweet at @discord if you need a quick pointer or two.

Tom will lead our financial operations to support Discord’s continued growth. 2020 was a pivotal year for Discord — we reached over 140 million monthly active users and exceeded 100M in revenue. Today, millions of people are on Discord organizing around communities of interest, from families staying in touch to group study sessions, communities gathering around a shared hobby, and even creating podcasts together. Tom spent the last five years as Head of Finance for Pinterest, helping to lead the company’s finance operations during a time of rapid growth. Before that, he served as Vice President of Technology Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs for almost a decade, advising a broad range of clients such as Square, Yahoo!, Yelp, and more. Tom’s extensive expertise in growing, scaling, and advising leading internet companies will help us continue to build on this momentum in 2021 and beyond. We sat down with Tom to hear a bit more about his initial thoughts about Discord — check it out! I just want to start by saying how excited I am to be joining the Discord team. I’ve been a fan of Discord for quite some time, and in the two weeks I’ve been here so far, my admiration for the company has only grown. My story started in Krakow, Poland, where I was born and lived until age 9. My parents were both chemical engineers, and similar to many immigrants who come to the United States without knowing English, they had to start new jobs to make ends meet. Eventually, my father started a small construction business and my mother became a lab technician. Their relentless drive, sacrifice, and dedication to making a life here in the U.S. for our family is what has inspired me throughout every step of my career. At the same time, the opportunity they were able to create for our family with a small business really piqued my interest in how businesses create value across multiple constituents. That ultimately led me to Wall Street where I spent nearly 15 years, most recently acting as an advisor on a broad range of financing and transactions. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work on really exciting deals with leading technology companies, from Square to Yelp to Hewlett-Packard. I loved seeing how companies used capital and M&A to drive value across multiple stakeholders, from their users, employees, investors, and their communities. I wanted to go deeper and be a part of that impact. I joined Pinterest at a time when the company was just scratching the surface of reaching its full potential. I was drawn to the company because Pinterest’s mission was aligned with its growth and business objectives which ultimately helped to drive real, positive outcomes for its users. I see similarities with how you all run Discord as well. There are so many things that drew me to Discord, but I’ll start with a bit of a personal anecdote. I’m not a huge sports guy but I really love going to the San Jose Earthquakes soccer games with my kids. However, I didn’t know many Quakes fans. One day, I stumbled upon a Discord server when I was looking for a place to connect with other fans during games. All of a sudden, I had discovered a whole community that had a place where they could interact around a shared interest. Having worked in the internet space for some time, I found it curious that very few companies were able to really crack community building across the social landscape. That’s when I really started to understand the unique value proposition of Discord, a service centered around communities of interest. I was also drawn to the company’s business model. This model is based on enabling users to provide value back into the communities they are a part of. Discord’s incentives are completely aligned with its users. I think this creates a really passionate user base and a company that is entirely focused on creating a space for people to find belonging, talk and gather around shared interests. It’s been a whirlwind but I think what has really stood out to me is Discord’s company culture. Discord is all about community and belonging, and everyone who works here is aligned with this mission. It’s clear that you and Stan have invested a lot of energy in building a great culture here from the start. The focus on not only what we do, but how we do it makes the company as special as the product. I can see that there has been a high level of focus on building a positive and inclusive culture from day 1, and that’s a really exciting thing to be a part of. There is an incredible opportunity ahead for this company. What I’m focused on is making sure we’re using the business to support the company’s mission, to create a space for communities and a place where people can find belonging. I want to help build a business to support this mission, not the other way around. More immediately, I’ll be looking to build my team in the coming months. If anyone is interested, please reach out!

{"website": "Discord", "title": "inside 8 bit music theorys growing video game soundtrack server", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/inside-8-bit-music-theorys-growing-video-game-soundtrack-server-fa33cdf2dee2", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com It’s time for the latest Community Spotlight: a showcase of some of the best and most unique servers across Discord. If you’re looking for like-minded people to discuss the finer points of your favorite video games with, there’s no place like Discord to find your community. The same is true if you’re a musician looking for peers to discuss, create, and share critique with. But what if you want to do both at the same time? There’s already a home waiting for you: the 8-bit Music Theory community . To find out how they’ve blended their love of controllers and composers, press play and read on. It all started when the creator of 8-bit Music Theory, a YouTube channel dedicated to analyzing popular games in terms of their soundtracks and composers, experimented with livestreaming for the first time. He was struck by how engaged, educated, and enthusiastic the discussions in his chat were. It struck me as being really cool that these people had found each other and had this great conversation through a mutual interest in my content, and I thought that I could use my channel to funnel like-minded video game music lovers into a community where they could share their interests with each other. He started developing a Discord server as a kind of extension of his channel: a place for music enthusiasts to put the concepts he talks about in his videos into practice. “I think my videos appeal to people interested in analysis as a form of entertainment, but there’s also information that could be useful for hobbyist musicians or aspiring composers,” he explains. “The latter type of viewer could use the Discord community as an outlet for practicing using information gleaned from the videos, and for finding like-minded musicians to connect with.” In other words: a chance to move up from the audience to the stage. As he discovered, it was an opportunity many were waiting for. Make no mistake, you don’t have to be a master musician or video game historian to get a kick out of the 8-bit Music Theory community. As long as you have a passing interest in beats or button-mashing, you’ll find plenty to chat about. You’ll also have a front-row pass to the server’s main attraction: a never-ending music festival featuring an ever-growing roster of talent. From the moment they join, musicians and music fans are integrated right into the community. “We have roles that members can choose from to display what instruments they play, whether they’re a composer, producer, music appreciator, or whatever else.” It makes finding people to chat and even collaborate with very easy. If you want to talk shop, share the finer points of an instrument, or even put together a brand-new supergroup, all you have to do is scroll through the members list and get connected. If you’re hungry for feedback, the server’s definitely got you covered. Anyone who wants thoughtful and critical responses to their work can find them in the #roast-and-post channel — whose name is definitely tongue-in-cheek. The focus isn’t on laughs, it’s on helping one another succeed and improve. I think any outlet for sharing your work with other people can be great motivation to push yourself creatively. There’s a lot going on. 8-bit Music Theory compares his community to the most well-known boss battle themes within the Final Fantasy community, “Dancing Mad” from Final Fantasy VI. When comparing the track to his own community, he explains: So many different musical styles and elements are woven together into [Dancing Mad] — driving synth parts, spooky carnival music, church-y organ music, crazy prog rock riffs — but they all work together to create a fantastic final product. There’s lots of different ways you could take advantage of the server: no matter what your level or specific interest around music and games, I’m sure you’ll find something for you on our server! While there’s always music in the air in the 8-bit Music Theory community, the headlining act is its weekly composition challenge. Already in its second year of operation, this tune-oriented tradition pushes creators to challenge themselves and their work on a regular basis. “Every week a new theme is posted, and members write original music around that theme and submit it. Then everyone gets together to critique each other’s work, offer encouragement and suggestions for improvement.” It’s rewarding for those who take part, but when each week brings a slate of brand-new and creative compositions, everyone in the server is a winner. But while pressure can be an amazing muse, not all the server’s traditions are as intense as the weekly competitions. “Year of the VGM takes a more laid back approach to the same basic idea, offering looser prompts once a month and a more casual mentality for members who find that attitude more conducive to fostering creativity.” For the users who get to enjoy the music either way, there’s no way to lose. 8-bit Music Theory started out as a YouTube series discussing music, but in the past few years, it’s been responsible for creating many amazing tracks of its own. The creator may have opinions on whether Earthbound or Breath of the Wild has a better soundtrack, but when pressed to name a favorite track created from within his own server, he was flummoxed. “There are so many great pieces of music posted by members, it’s too hard to choose!” Luckily, you don’t have to. Check out the 8-bit Music Theory server at discord.gg/8bmt and catch some tunes…and maybe put out a few yourself. Imagine a Place 327 2 Community 327 claps 327 2 Written by Chief Robot Hamster.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discords college ambassadors helped clubs stay close", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discords-college-ambassadors-helped-clubs-stay-close-789ad31dbed2", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Since time immemorial, clubs have helped students stave off stress, loneliness, and the many pressures of higher education. There’s almost nothing college can throw at you that you can’t weather if you’ve got a solid group of friends to fall back on. To help student organizations get even more organized, we’ve recruited dozens of Discord Ambassadors whose goal is to help assist hundreds of clubs in creating Discord servers to hang out in, plan events, and keep in touch with one another. It’s hard work keeping social clubs alive in an age of remote learning — but our ambassadors are up to the job. An officer in several clubs at UC Berkeley, Christina Ji was already familiar with what student organizations needed. In fact, she was already friends with a lot of their leaders. “From there,” she explains, “it was a process of narrowing down the types of clubs I knew had the most consistent and complex needs for messaging.” The clubs that most need to stay in touch are the ones who have the most need for a server. And as Christina learned, they were also some of the wariest of change. It’s understandable — every club has its own needs when looking for a new place to call home, so if a club is considering moving to a new platform, they need to make sure it’s a great fit. Rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach, Christina took the time to truly understand what clubs needed in order to run successfully and found each of them the perfect solution. “Creating these new communities structured around a club’s needs provided me with a lot of insight towards how there’s so many different ways to connect with people. I found that, as I continued to onboard new organizations, I was also constantly learning how to make my own leadership more effective and efficient!” Every server had a favorite new feature. But what did Christina enjoy most? “Seeing community reactions to voice channels! Being able to speak and even share music with one another so seamlessly always surprised people.” Which just goes to show: no matter how seriously you take your organization, there’s always time for a little Traditional Polka Loops (10 Hours) . When Thomas Yee set out to get UC Irvine’s clubs hooked up on Discord, he got the word out every way he could: Facebook and Reddit posts, networking through his clubs and his major, and even a few recommendations from friends. It was only a matter of time before the fifteen clubs that Thomas helped were hitting the ground running. His successes spoke for themselves — literally. “Eventually, leaders were talking among themselves and sharing the efficacy of Discord with one another.” Of course, getting a club’s officers on board is only half the journey of bringing student organizations to Discord. Making sure your club’s new Discord server fosters a lasting community is just as important — you wouldn’t want to go through all the effort of moving just for the server to stay quiet. So how do you keep your community intact while making the jump to a new platform? Thomas says it varied: “T he most straightforward method was simply telling their users about the switch. However, others would host game nights, meetings, speaker panels or workshops exclusively over Discord to take advantage of the all-in-one text, video and voice call features. Others would onboard a portion of their members (e.g. leadership or members that were part of a mentorship program) and have that focus group spread the word to the rest of the club. Some clubs even incorporated giveaways that featured official Discord merch to bring awareness to the new platform!” After a few months of hard work, Thomas is justifiably proud of his success. “I found it very rewarding to help so many communities maintain their sense of culture during the pandemic! I take pride in the fact that I was able to succeed in this new program and provide tangible value to many people in such a short few months.” On behalf of all the Anteaters who don’t have to miss out on friends and fellowship during these tough times, we say: great job, Thomas! Right off the bat, UC Santa Barbara student Kayla Kim had plenty of friends involved in campus clubs that could benefit from their own Discord server. Once she helped her existing friends and clubs get set up, Kayla realized she needed to break out of her shell and find others who may need help. “This ambassadorship definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone when it came to connecting with people and being proactive in assisting [a] club’s needs,” Kayla explains. “It also pushed me to become more creative and tailor each club’s Discord server to their unique purposes.” While Kayla says most organizations found Discord’s interface easy to pick up and teach their members, her greatest challenges — and opportunities — were groups who had very specific technical needs. Getting them hooked up with the tools they wanted was an intriguing challenge. “The most interesting group I helped onboard was our Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), more so because the features they needed were very unique from other clubs. Their organization organizes school concerts, film viewings, special lectures, and cultural events. With online learning, they needed a way to host office hours on a new platform that could keep track of each board member’s activity during their scheduled office hours slot. All the other clubs I worked with had a link for their members to join and stay permanently, whereas ASPB needed a space where students could join temporarily and be removed after their meetings were over. I was able to integrate a bot that would log every time a board member joins and leaves their respective office hours voice channel and then organizes it into a private text channel.” Kayla makes sure to check back in with the communities she’s onboarded and get their feedback. “All of it has been very positive. Having leaders message me about how helpful Discord has been in keeping their members engaged and connected during remote learning was very fulfilling!” You can have our feedback too: great work, Kayla! When Ananya Gupta set out to spread Discord across UC Berkeley’s clubs and organizations, she sized up her prospects carefully. Rather than randomly approaching everyone along campus to tell ’em about Discord, she figured out what kind of clubs would benefit most from a server. This way, explaining the usefulness of a server to begin with becomes much easier. “I tried to target clubs that had various committees, tiers of leadership, or was overall a larger organization. The reason for this is because I thought clubs like these would benefit the most from Discord’s platform that provides multiple channels — text and voice — has built-in roles that the server moderator can create/assign, and has other features that could help provide a new method of organization and communication!” In a world where most students and organizations connect digitally, Ananya says the hardest part was simply letting people know you’re there to help. “It was just challenging being in a virtual setting and getting people you don’t know to be interested in what you’re offering,” she explains. “But I think once I started reaching out in more direct and personal ways it became a lot easier.” Getting personal meant learning more about the campus communities she was pitching to, and that in and of itself turned out to be a rewarding experience. Making her way through the list of student organizations felt like a digital club week. “UC Berkeley has so many clubs and people, so it’s always nice to feel like you know a little more than you did before,” she says. “It was definitely super exciting getting to connect so many people with discord and meet new people while doing it! Especially since being in quarantine made it hard to feel connected with my campus community, I loved being able to do so by being a Discord Ambassador.” Whether you know an existing club of your own that could benefit from a nicely-organized Discord server, or you just want to help your group of friends stay close, we’ve got a good amount of resources to help you or your club get off the ground running. For those looking for the best tips to run a college Discord community, check out one of our recent Community Spotlights called How a UC Berkeley Student Helps Recreate a Campus Experience on Discord and take a page from Berkeley student James Nguyen’s playbook. In addition, you can share our special College page that quickly runs down the basics and includes a special server template to get started with. For larger communities on the road to Partnership, we’ve also released Fostering a Thriving, Partner-Worthy Community on Discord , a list of recommendations and ideas for how to keep your server going strong, no matter the size. If you’re at this level, the Discord Moderator Academy will also prove beneficial for your mod team. And if you’re still just trying to get off the ground and seeing if it’s even worth starting up a server, keep an eye out on this blog — we’re working on a piece for those who want to start their first server ever, no matter what it’s about. A Discord Ambassador isn’t just a snazzy title you show off with your friends. It’s someone who helps communities of all sizes, including those both on and off-campus, find a new home on Discord. Just as Christina, Thomas, Kayla, and Ananya have done, Ambassadors help bring communities together, no matter what everyone’s unique interest is. You, too, can help the world. Tell us about a server you’ve helped start that became something special by tweeting us at @discord . We’d love to hear about it.

Communities of all sizes benefit from the aid that Server Moderation provides. Whether it’s you and a pal managing your small friend group server or a whole team of mods helping manage a community of thousands, helping make sure things run smoothly improves the experience for everyone. Moderation in itself isn’t the easiest thing to tackle. We’d like to spend some time on Safer Internet Day to give some insight as to what sorts of things moderators consider and handle on a day-to-day basis. As a community platform, moderators are the first line of defense between any harm on the platform and protecting our users. Before an issue ever reaches our Trust & Safety colleagues, it often runs through a server’s moderator team who has to consider whether the content should be allowed in their community and whether a user should be warned, kicked, or banned. Moderators are community managers and leaders within Discord. They don’t just enforce our Community Guidelines — they set the tone for the types of topics and content that are allowed to shape the entire culture of a community and, collectively, Discord as a whole. Moderators are a necessary part of making Discord the special place that it is, and it is due to their hard efforts in creating amazing communities that our millions of users find places to call home. When creating a community on Discord, the first moderator is often the owner or creator of the server. As the needs of the community grow, moderators can leverage Discord’s many features to perform everything they need. This includes basic moderation tasks such as kicking or deleting messages, to adjusting permissions for what users can do or see in any given channel. Later on, they may even leverage the latest Community features like our new Welcome Screen, and utilize moderation bots for more complex tasks. Moderators are essential for keeping communities running, growing, cared for, and curated around the different kinds of conversations and activities that bring people together. Your community moderators help your community stay at its best while providing leadership to the hundreds of thousands of communities across Discord. We asked a few Partnered server owners for their advice after they’ve grown their servers from humble beginnings to Partner Program worthy. Owner of the discord.gg/python server, joe#6000, says that you should shape your moderation policies around your community, rather than shaping your community around your moderation policies. Joe explains a bit more further, “Be careful how much you moderate, it’s a bad idea to under-moderate but it can kill a community if you over-moderate, so you need to be active in your community and understand the machine in order to moderate it.” Just because you moderate your server, doesn’t mean you should only moderate. SpaceGhostForce, owner of the Fantasy Football Discord we talked about in a past Community Spotlight , reminds us all that we should always connect with your community as a member, not an “enforcer.” “I ’m here to keep things under control, but I’m also here to talk shop even more. Don’t laud your abilities/perms, you’re there to keep folks engaged, not on their toes 24/7.” But sometimes, you’ve gotta remember that while it’s a server that you own or help moderate, the community that comes together within your server is who you’re supporting. DecayToDeath#7968 told us “you can’t manage an online space (or any for that matter) without molding it along with peoples’ needs and ideas, but balance that with your ability to take a stance on things like bigotry, harassment, and trolling with little tolerance.” “I’ve genuinely considered the communities I own to be families, and the positive environments would’ve begun to decay long ago if not for my (and my staff’s) nipping those toxic elements in the bud every time they cropped up.” If you can balance how you moderate with the needs of the community, as these three Partnered server owners helped explain, you’re on your way to running a great server. Whether you’re new to moderation or a seasoned community builder, the Discord Moderator Academy contains dozens of articles about every facet of moderation on Discord that you can use to enhance your own moderation prowess. Fun fact: nearly all the articles in the Moderator Academy are written by moderators, reflecting a diverse set of experiences and perspectives that have helped shape what Discord is today. The content is available for anyone and applies to moderation practices beyond Discord. Looking for more direct conversations? In addition to the Academy, the Discord Moderator Discord server is a place where moderators can share ideas and seek wisdom from one another, and build a support system of people who can help them take on tougher moderation tasks. There are also opportunities to interact with the Trust & Safety team directly, as well as engineers who are building features specifically for community management and moderation. It’s currently open for new members by referral, but look out for more information about how to apply in the coming weeks.

The struggles of the past year have shown how important that mission is — even as we’ve been forced to change the ways in which we all learn and share with one another. Across the world, education has moved from the classroom to the living room. The shift from physical to digital learning has changed a lot of things we take for granted, including what’s usually one of the biggest moments in someone’s life: attending college for the first time. For International Education Day, we’re taking some time to talk with one of the many classes whose first year of university life didn’t go the way they imagined: the UC Berkeley Class of 2024. With teamwork, determination, and the creative use of their Discord community, these students have banded together to overcome one of the greatest challenges an incoming class has faced in generations. Incoming freshman and Economics & Media Studies major James Nguyen was proud to become a Berkeley Bear last year. But with the pandemic forcing students to stay at home, his first few semesters weren’t quite what he’d expected. “It was hard coming into my first year as a university student,” James explains. “We would be taking classes remotely, it felt harder to make friends since it’s different seeing someone in person compared to a computer screen.” That’s when James had the idea to create a Discord server for UC Berkeley. “I have always seen a lot of potential in Discord, especially during the times we were in. I felt that creating a server would give incoming students, like myself, the opportunity to connect with others over our shared interest of attending the #1 Public University, UC Berkeley, for the next four years of our life.” The server started off small. But as more and more students realized online classes were the new normal, word of mouth made the server grow by leaps and bounds. As of this writing, the Class of 2024 server has over 1,500 members. Which means that even learning remotely, James has a lot of new friends to talk to. “My friend group and I have called each other every single night for the past 8–9 months and am extremely thankful for being able to meet an amazing group of individuals who I would gladly call my family at Berkeley.” As UC Berkeley begins its spring semester, many students continue to study remotely from off-campus lodging. Thanks to James’s server, however, no-one has to go it alone: the Class of 2024 is never more than a few clicks or swipes away from their classmates. Students pop in to the server to swap gossip, study, get in a few rounds of Among Us, and even work on coding projects together. In addition to impromptu gatherings, the server’s Event Coordinator Team hosts movie nights, game nights, and even “Bob Ross painting sessions” where community members create some happy little trees with one another. Cooing over adorable animals. Gushing over the latest anime and music releases. Swapping pics of what you ate. Messaging @everyone to show them your painting of JJ the Jet Plane flying with a pickle over the mountainside. Suddenly, staying home for classes doesn’t seem quite as daunting…or as lonely. Naturally, the Class of 2024 server splits recreation with good ol’ fashioned studying. When it’s time to sit down and cram, six class-specific roles help students within the same major connect with one another. Anybody looking for a server for a specific class will find the 2024 community is a great place to ask around and find fellows. “A few of my classes have official Discords which have course staff to answer questions, and some have movie and game nights,” says Rsha256, one of the many members of the Class of 2024. Student Nikhil says about a third of their Discord servers are Berkeley-related, but everyone comes back to the main Class of 2024 server as their main home and base of operations. It may not feel like it now, but it’s just a matter of time before things get back to normal. Everyone cramming online will get their chance to walk proudly along campus as a Berkeley Bear. When that day comes, they won’t be struggling to catch up and make friends: their friends will already be waiting for them. Sablewind, one of the many members of the Class of 2024, is already making plans to hang out IRL with her new crew. “Even though it’s so early, we’ve made tentative plans to go skiing, get KBBQ, and just hang out or study together in general.” Along with Sablewind, KarynPham wants to meet some fellow designers and inventors. Giselle is owed a free boba from another community member; it’s a long time to wait for tapioca, but that’ll just make it taste all the better. The class of 2024 have already shared a lot of memories together. What’s more, they’ve shared their struggle. When the final year rolls around and students receive their diplomas, it won’t be just another degree: it’ll be a legacy of their unique situation. “Being a part of the class of 2024 is a badge of honor and I’m proud to be in a diverse and hardworking cohort of scholars ready to serve themselves and others,” says chemical.nose. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.” If you’re looking to create a server specifically for you and your fellow classmates, there’s plenty of Discord resources to get you started.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "celebrating black community leaders on discord", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/celebrating-black-community-leaders-on-discord-75d23ea60fea", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com For today’s special edition of the Community Spotlight, Discord is honoring Black History Month by featuring some of our most exceptional community leaders. Every server in today’s post was founded for different reasons, but all provide their users a place to share and connect with one another. Giving people a place to belong is a powerful act of creation — and one which we are proud to celebrate. When artist Evermore was looking for a place to share his work, he found a pattern of toxicity and hostility towards Black creators in popular fandoms and communities. Horror stories of creators hounded for an online profile or a Black OC abounded. That’s why he took matters into his own hands, founding the Afro Arts Avenue: a predominantly Black/LGBT server focused on socializing, connecting, and helping each other grow in their own way. “We are mainly a server about illustrations, but anyone who feels passionate about the creative outlet of their choice has a space to showcase their talents in the Avenue. I saw there was a lack of a creative space for Black people on Disboards. I took the opportunity to make this community that gives Black artists a space to connect and grow with others like them.” Even though the server has been active for only half a year, Evermore says he’s very hopeful for the future. Already he’s seeing creators sharing themselves more freely, happily, and unselfconsciously. “It was just a joy watching everyone chat with each other, making friends, and stuff,” says Evermore. “That’s all I wanted from this.” Cy may not have started out with an army, but over the course of his Twitch streaming career, he’s certainly built one. That’s why he’s given the fans and followers of his channel CyFy a new home on Discord: a server just for the peaceful, positive folks known as the Nerd Army. “I felt like just streaming wasn’t enough and I needed to connect with the community that was growing from streaming. I started it up after streaming for a little over a year on Twitch. It’s a place you can come to feel uplifted when you are disheartened.” The community’s been going strong for over five years, but new arrivals are welcomed with open arms. One of Cy’s favorite things about the server is how friendly it is to recent arrivals, plying them with invites to game and movie nights, making sure they feel right at home. The Nerd Army always has room for more recruits. Making your server a genuinely welcoming place is more than a surface-level commitment. It isn’t just a matter of waving hello: it’s about building a place where users are safe, valued, and heard. PleasantlyTwstd has put in the work, and the result is The Wine Cellar: a bold, beautiful, and supportive home for a wide and growing community. PleasantlyTwstd (or Vanessa) describes The Wine Cellar as a place that builds up and supports marginalized people everywhere. It’s both a safe haven and a platform for POCs, people with disabilities, neurodivergent users, members of the LGBTQIAP+ community, and anyone else looking for a place to belong. In The Wine Celler, they “make it clear that marginalized people are out here and we don’t (and absolutely SHOULDN’T) have to hide — I want to see more of US in the limelight!” “I’m very open and vocal about the things I do/don’t represent, and the things I do/don’t tolerate. It usually sets the tone and the community reflects/emulates that: we do no harm, but we also take no sh*t. We make new members feel welcome with laughter, joy, goofiness, and wine… but also a commitment to their safety and growth not just as fellow content creators and freelancers, but also as people.” Once they become a part of the community, new members pay that attitude forward. After getting placement on the Twitch front page, Vanessa woke up the following day to a breathtaking #general chat: an outpouring of love and appreciation for new members, all of whom were grateful for finding such a “warm, welcoming, and safe space.” If you’re looking for the same warm welcome, don’t wait any longer. The wine is optional; the support of the community isn’t. At first, all Shakeema (who streams on her Twitch channel “keekeexbabyy”) wanted was a place for her viewers to hang out after her streams. What she ended up building was more than that: an inclusive space that covers topics ranging from gaming to anime and so much more. It’s all in a day’s work for the members of the Kitty Gang. When the show’s over for the day, the Kitty Gang community come out to relax, play some games, and watch stuff together in voice chat. The vibe is kind of like when you leave a movie theater and your friends want to hang out afterward… only here, the movie stars are there hanging out with you. While they don’t have an exact favorite moment to share, keekee says the best part of running the Kitty Gang is “ just overall watching the community grow and watching everyone interact. It’s beautiful to see I am building not only such an amazing space but community of people, even when I am not present. ” In other words, every moment is the best moment. If that makes you want to join the clowder yourself, you’re not the only one. Within a self-proclaimed “cluster bomb of memes” lies a community founded around gamers and creators. The server came together around founder Cloudie so quickly, and with such a thundering surge of energy and goodwill, that it earned its stormy name overnight: Cloudie & The Squall. It’s a community so welcoming, even complete strangers wandering in feel like long-time lurkers in hours. “ Every morning when I wake up and open Discord to see the members saying good morning to people they only met the day before is nice. It makes me feel almost like I’m waking up to my own slumber party & greeting the community.” How do you end up with this kind of energy? Well, the energy you bring is important: setting a positive example means getting positive results. Cloudie specifically calls out the moderation team for helping to keep things smooth. ( Mods are pretty great, ya know? ) But at the end of the day, like any thriving community, it’s a group effort. Sound like your kind of place? Answer the Squall Call. Interested in running tabletop roleplaying games for your friends and family, but intimidated by all the charts, tables, and encyclopedia-length rulebooks? A good teacher makes all the difference, and that’s just what you’ll find in the New Gamemaster Month community. Run by Monte Cook Games on a Discord server owned by LaTia Jacquise, New Gamemaster Month takes place every January. Its goal is to help rookies become tabletop champions through inspiration, advice, and some good ol’ step-by-step guidance to guide you on a path to success. That said, the server’s good for tips, tricks, and success strategies all year round. “We made sure that representatives from each RPG publisher as well as experienced GMs for each RPG system were invited to be able to field any questions that the new GMs might have, as well as channels for asking general questions and sharing resources. Reading the success stories of first games completed is really rewarding; all the GMs are excited to have run their games and are eager to run more!” If you happen to run into any mishaps along the way, the community’s robust player Code of Conduct ensures that everyone’s potential issues will be addressed fairly and swiftly. By the time February rolls around, you might be changing your server role from New GM to Experienced! If you’ve been around the internet since the mid-2000s, you’ve probably lost a few hours (or days) to Greg McLeod and his viral studio sensation, McLeodGaming . They’re the independent developers responsible for the fan-made fighting game Super Smash Flash , puzzle platformer Yeah Jam Fury: U Me, Everybody! and upcoming Kickstarter success Fraymakers . Needless to say, they’ve got a lot of fans, and those fans need a place to swap strats and catch the latest news. For smiley block enthusiasts and party brawl connoisseurs, the hangout of choice is the official McLeodGaming community. From deep-dives into each SSF character to the latest updates on the progress of Fraymakers , it’s a fighting game fan’s paradise. Super Smash Flash and Fraymakers thrive off of community support and contributions, and open communication and collaboration is a perfect fit for the sorts of games Greg’s studio works on. It’s a friendly paradise too — Greg says that many of the server moderators have already been part of the community for years. It’s part of why the community feels so much like a family. “We do everything we can to foster an environment that’s safe and family-friendly. Video gaming should be about fun, and that’s the one interest that all community members have in common! We’re also very open to community feedback for our games, so our server acts as a direct line of communication between players and devs in that way.” To some, it’s all about improving skills. To others, it’s a place to collaborate with the many in-server game dev teams that have sprouted throughout the community’s life. For everybody: it’s home. If you’ve ever wanted to run a community as great as these, we recently released a guide: Fostering a Thriving, Partner-Worthy Community on Discord . It’s an excellent resource for taking your server to the next level. Don’t know where to start? Watch our blog: we’re working on additional guides for server beginners and best practices that can help everyone, even those who aren’t looking towards the Partner Program. For server moderators, the Discord Moderator Academy is a great place to enrich your mod abilities. We also encourage you to take a look at our blog post containing Resources for Empowering Black Communities . While Black History Month is specifically during February, the fight for equality doesn’t stop after the month is over. Do what you can to support, wherever and whenever you can.

Travel you were excited for has been postponed to next year, long-standing family traditions may be canceled, and the act of hanging out with your friends has likely shifted from physical gatherings to the smaller confines of your computer or phone. Whether it’s going out for a short walk for some sunlight, getting into that succulent growing hobby you’ve been dreaming of, or just doing some stretches to get out of your seat, every little bit helps bring a sense of normalcy. It breaks the increased monotony of the winter season that’s elevated further in a COVID world. Sometimes, the things floating around the back of your mind can’t be identified and addressed by yourself. Maybe you’re not sure how to handle them on your own, or you need to talk to someone for advice on how to overcome these feelings. That’s okay. If 2020’s got your mind a bit more cloudy during the winter season than past years, or if something residing in your thoughts for a while now rears its head more often in these cold months, we’d like to share a few articles and resources that have helped members of the Discord team when we also need it. The following articles are pieces that the Discord team has found to be a valuable resource in learning more about what may be going on: Stress, depression and the holidays: Tips for coping (Mayo Clinic) 14 Tips to Beat Holiday Depression, According to Psychologists (Health Magazine) Risk Factors and Things to Look Out For (Suicide Prevention Hotline) To Write Love On Her Arms , a non-profit dedicated to presenting hope and finding help for those struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury, and suicide. Take This , an organization providing comprehensive resources and support tailored for the game development community. At PAX, they also hold “Quiet Rooms” anyone can use to take a breather. It’s hard to know how to exactly assist when someone may need help. It’s only natural to want to say and do the right things, but most of us aren’t experts. Even if you don’t sit down and get to the bottom of things, letting someone know you’re around if they need anything can make all the difference in the world.

Since then we’ve heard about all the ways you’ve been using Discord to explore your current interests or ones you aspire to learn, meet like-minded people who are just as hyped about something as you are, or just to talk to someone when you need an ear. It’s been really amazing to see how Discord has become a digital third place for so many people: a way to spend quality time together just talking or hanging out, no matter where you are. 2020’s been a heavy year for all of us and we’re honored that many of you have turned to Discord to find belonging and comfort during such a challenging time. We’re just glad we’ve been able to be helpful in any way possible. As we take a moment to reflect and prepare for what’s ahead, we’d like to highlight a few of the things we’ve done to make Discord a better place for everyone from welcoming new and diverse communities, to strengthening our team and making the app more and more useful. As we’ve all shifted our lives to spend more time at home, we’ve learned to adapt. At Discord we found ourselves doing a lot of virtual happy hours, sharing pictures of our day, Animal Crossing island hopping, pizza parties, paint nights, and even cooking classes. It’s been inspiring to see all the creative ways you’ve been using Discord to stay close despite spending more time apart. We’ve seen tons of new organizations, events, and groups join Discord to create their own spaces: College students recreating the campus club atmosphere; activists organizing around political and social movements; friends playing Among Us all around the world; and even couples hosting virtual wedding ceremonies. Alongside these newer types of communities, Discord became the virtual home for long-standing events that have typically been physical gatherings including VidCon , DefCon , and Wonder Women Tech . In the sports scene, the Sacramento Kings launched the first-ever official NBA team Discord server , bringing fans who miss the courts closer together and giving them a place to stay connected even after things reopen. Our own event — the 4th annual Discord Snowsgiving celebration — ended up being our biggest ever, with 200,000 people joining the server. We raised over $200,000 for Doctors Without Borders and included a week-long digital music festival featuring guests like Kaskade, TOKiMONSTA, Nova Miller, and DJ Snoopadelic (aka Snoop Dogg). As Discord grows, it’s important that we continue our work to make it even better. We’ve seen a massive increase in people using the mobile app since the start of the year and the experience on your phone should be just as great as it is on desktop. With that in mind, we spent nearly all of 2020 improving the speed and stability of our mobile apps. In addition to bringing video chat to servers and built-in noise suppression to desktop, we made sure mobile also gets to enjoy these features instead of waiting. To close out the year, we just added the ability to share your screen on mobile, so you can hang out and play games or browse your favorite social apps together. To try it out for yourself, hop in a voice channel on your phone and swipe up (or take a peek at our Help Center ). Feedback from our communities informs every feature we build, and we’re always exploring new ways to help you have fun and express yourselves. As always, the core features of Discord — text, voice, and video — will stay free for everyone. For Discord Nitro subscribers, we’re looking into making new ways to make it even cooler, but you’ll have to wait and see! In June, we committed to growing our team in a way that helps shape a future that benefits and supports everyone. A big component of achieving this goal is to diversify our leadership team. We’re honored to have welcomed both our new Chief Marketing Officer Tesa Aragones to oversee Discord’s expansion beyond gaming and Prachi Gupta as our new VP of Engineering. We’ve broadened our lawyer-like expertise with the arrival of Clint Smith as our Chief Legal Officer, and the three of them are already hard at work to make Discord a more positive and welcoming place for everyone. We’re extremely grateful for the continued support from our Discord Nitro subscribers who are helping us show the world it’s possible to build a business that doesn’t depend on serving ads or selling your personal data. We have big plans for 2021 and we’re excited to announce that we’ve raised an additional $100 million in funding to help make Discord even better. Reading through the hundreds of Discord stories shared with us over the year has been such a rewarding way to see how our work is helping so many of you create more belonging in your lives. We’re deeply thankful to all of you and if you’ve got an idea you think could make Discord even better, you’re always welcome to hit us up with your suggestions on Twitter at @jasoncitron and @svishnevskiy.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "building open source design tools to improve discords design workflow", "author": ["Daniel Destefanis"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/building-open-source-design-tools-to-improve-discords-design-workflow-9a25c29f9143", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com With the release of the Figma plugin API last year, the design team at Discord saw an exciting opportunity. Around the same time as the Figma plugin beta, we were working hard on improving the accessibility of our dark and light themes. Neither theme was passing our accessibility bar and so we were working hard to address it. In order to guarantee our new color mapping was working, we needed to design every new feature in both themes. Creating double of the design artifacts was time-consuming but necessary. This is when the design tooling spark ignited. We asked ourselves “ Could we build a tool to help us? ” Spoiler alert we could, we did, and it rules. Since then, this question has become a critical part of our process. Less time spent doing repetitive tasks and more time focusing on more important parts of our jobs. Preventing design debt. Improving the developer/designer handoff process. Fostering the design tooling community so people can build off of what we’ve started. The problems we wanted to solve through design tooling. The methodology and thinking we used while creating these tools. How you and your design team can utilize these tools today (yay for open source)! Design tooling can automate the menial and repetitive tasks you do dozens of times a day. Replacing copy in multiple text fields at the same time, selecting all instances of a layer, or in our case creating two versions of every design. Earlier I mentioned how we needed to create a light and dark theme version of every design we made. This type of work was precisely the type of work we could solve with our own design tool. Auto Theme is a Figma plugin we created to automatically theme designs. Instead of having to manually switch each layer and color to its light theme counterpart, we instead just had to run this tool. This made validating designs in both themes substantially less effort. For instance, I recently worked on improving our mobile onboarding experience and wanted to make sure we were providing a great experience on both themes. Auto-theme made this significantly easier. It works by looping over each layer you have selected in your design. From there, the plugin determines how to style a color depending on what type of layer it is. Is it text? Well then use this heading primary color. This layer is a shape? Well, use this primary background color instead. What color a layer should swap to is determined by the user. In our instance, we set this up once, and now it works out of the box for our entire team. In cases where the tool doesn’t know what to do (say it runs into an illustration), it flags it and shows it to you in a list of layers that were skipped. Although we built this tool, it’s just one of many plugins we use to help automate tasks in our day-to-day. I’m sure most designers have heard the question “ is this ready for development? ”. Designers aren’t perfect, mistakes will happen, and that’s OK . This is especially true when you’re designing a flow across several screens. Design Lint is a Figma plugin for linting your designs. Our approach to solving the “is this ready for development? / will the next designer to visit this file will want to scream” problem is a tool for helping you find the errors in your designs. Linting is common practice in programming that helps find errors and helps keep code consistent. We thought, why should design files be any different? Design Lint checks your design to see where it’s missing styles (Figma’s name for design tokens/variables). Are you using typography that isn’t found in your design system? Are you using a border-radius that doesn’t match your standard? Is that new shade of black actually not a variable the developer has? Design Lint flags these issues for you. Designs often consist of hundreds to thousands of layers at a time. This tool finds mistakes for us so we can fix them before we start working with a developer on implementation. This also saves the developer time from having to ask a question if a mistake was an intentional choice or not. When running design lint over our entire design system, we can find errors before they propagate out to every file. We built this tool to work straight out of the box for everyone, but since it’s open-source, you can create custom linting rules for your team. An issue we’ve run into as a product team is that Figma isn’t easy to navigate. In order to address this, we created a plugin called Table of Contents. This plugin automatically generates a cover page called “Table of Contents”. On that page, we generate a frame with a list of all the pages in the file, placeholder links (that can be used to link to related materials), and a date. Not being able to find specific designs, especially in larger projects, was a common problem for people outside of the design team. This plugin aimed to address the “where can I find that design?” problem. Table of Contents is open source , can be customized to use your companies fonts, and is also available as a Figma template . In order to make maintaining and building new tools easier, we built a tool to help us. “A tool to build tools” you could say. Inspector is pretty straightforward in what it does but slightly complicated to explain. Every layer in Figma contains important meta-information. Its name, ID, whether it has children (little circle and little polygon, they’re so well behaved), what type of layer it is (text, image, shape), and more. Inspector displays this meta-information for the layers you have selected. Think of it like chrome developer-tools, but for Figma designs. We also use this plugin to help update Auto Theme colors when a new color is added. At Discord, we believe in open source. Both our engineering team and design team utilize open source libraries, frameworks, and resources often. We want your team to share the same benefits we’ve experienced from building and adopting these tools into our workflow. This is why everything I’ve mentioned in this post is free and open for your team to use. Each tool was made with the Figma design system in-mind. Each plugin should just feel like an extension of the interface you’re already used to. A few of these plugins can be installed straight from the Figma plugin page. However, we’ve still made them open source in case you want to make them more specific for your team. Auto Theme - Github Design Lint - Figma plugin page or Github Inspector - Figma plugin page or Github Table of Contents - Figma plugin page or Github Discord Project Scaffold - Github You can also view all of our open source design files at figma.com/@discord . As a team, we’re excited to see how design tooling will grow. Will we see code formatters like prettier.js but for designs? Will we see a design version of npm or yarn? Live type checking while designing with design tokens? These ideas may all be constrained by thinking too close to existing development tools, but we believe this is just the beginning of a larger movement of how we work as designers. We’re excited to see what the community builds from here and hope you find the tools we’ve made helpful for your team.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord implemented app wide keyboard navigation", "author": ["Jon Egeland"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-implemented-app-wide-keyboard-navigation-abf073fd71de", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com We believe that Discord is for everyone — which is why we’ve been hard at work this year to improve the accessibility of our apps across the board. We still have plenty more to go, but we thought we’d share part of the story of one of our recent projects: Keyboard Navigation in the desktop app . This kind of work benefits all kinds of users. It enables those who can’t comfortably use a mouse to access everything in the app, assists screen reader users in understanding and interacting with Discord effectively, and provides power users with even more shortcuts and opportunities to work as efficiently as possible. As a relatively small team, projects like this let us have a big impact and raise the bar for everyone in one go. Keen users may realize Discord has already supported some keyboard usage in small parts of the app for years. Existing keyboard shortcuts allow you to move between channels, take you through input fields in forms, and quickly access things like Search and the Quick Switcher . The goal of our project was to expand keyboard support beyond just specific shortcuts to *everything*, making Keyboard Navigation a truly first-class experience. A number of design and engineering challenges stood in our way, but one was particularly difficult and was seemingly unanswered by modern browsers or other projects in the space: how do we consistently indicate where focus is on the page? That may sound like a simple and well-explored problem at a glance — we assumed it would be as well! As time went on, we quickly realized just how many unsolved complications and constraints ruled out all existing options we could find. If you’ve experimented with creating focus styles with CSS before, you’re probably familiar with the two primary options that browsers currently provide: the :focus selector and the outline property . These two options are how browsers tend to implement their default focus styles, but if you want consistency between different browsers or have a design specification to adhere to, it’s likely that you’ve added a rule like this somewhere in your styles: This single rule should be enough to handle any element that has focus on the page and render a consistent, hopefully -visible ring around it. But, especially when integrating into a larger codebase, things start to fall apart fast. Things like clipped outlines in overflow-hidden containers, mismatched radiuses on rounded shapes, and strangely positioned outlines based on the padding and margins of the active element, all of which you can see in action here . At face value, these seem like relatively simple problems to solve. Just move some padding around, use a box-shadow , or be careful when using overflow: hidden , and everything's fine, right? But that's not really a scalable solution. We want to avoid the added burden of additional styling constraints that we can’t easily enforce with tooling, and we also want a system that will “just work” for our engineers. We spent about a week exploring other possibilities. Everything from giving each element in our component library its own focus style, to having a global listener and renderer that tracks when document.activeElement changes. Going through all of the drawbacks and other issues that these options presented had could take up an entire post on their own, but nothing really stuck until we were willing to compromise. From the shortcomings we encountered with default focus styles, we knew we had to detach the rendering from the target element. We also discovered that it couldn't just be a single top-level component without a whole different crop of issues popping up. New problems, like rendering on top of hidden layers and keeping up with scroll positions, make these rings feel “floaty” and disconnected from the actual content of the page. What we ended up with is a powerful and flexible system that meets all of our requirements, with escape hatches for the handful of edge cases we encountered related to interaction design. The whole system is built on two components: FocusRing for declaring where a ring should be placed, and FocusRingScope for declaring a root position for rings to be rendered. FocusRing is the core driver of the entire system. It doesn't actually render anything itself, but it handles everything from detecting when the target element gains and loses focus to communicating with the containing FocusRingScope and passing through any customizations that consumers specify. For the majority of use cases, though, the usage is plain and simple: just wrap the target element with a FocusRing , and everything else is taken care of: By default, the FocusRing will take the child it is given and automatically inject onBlur and onFocus handlers using React.cloneElement . Beyond that, it provides additional props to change whether the ring should try to emulate :focus or :focus-within , class names to apply directly to the child when it has focus, and even options for specifying a different target element for focus detection or where the ring will be positioned. A more complex example with some of these options might look like this: In this example, the focusTarget and ringTarget refs tell the FocusRing to listen for focus events on the input element itself, but render the actual ring around the entire div container. This kind of effect is extremely useful when the design of a component has a clear boundary that doesn't line up with the focusable element it contains, such as that SearchBar above, or a custom Checkbox where the label gets included in the \"focused content\" but the focus is just on the input itself. FocusRingScope is the mediator for actually rendering rings. As mentioned before, rings can't just be rendered at a single root of the DOM and instead have to be contained to smaller parts of the page (like scrollable areas or absolutely-positioned containers). The Scope declares the roots of those sections, where the nearest Scope in the ancestry of a Ring will be responsible for rendering it into the DOM. This accommodates those situations where some elements might be partially occluded or scrolled out of the viewport and the rendered ring should respect those boundaries. All that’s required by the Scope is a reference to a container element, which it uses to calculate the position for the ring that it renders. Internally, these components communicate through a context , where the FocusRing provides the context with an element to render a ring around, which then calculates position and style properties, and finally FocusRingScope subscribes so that it gets updated whenever the target changes. The only additional thing to remember is to include a FocusRingScope at the root of your app. Otherwise, rings won't have anywhere to be rendered by default. Even with this approach, there are still a few problems that don’t have particularly clean solutions. We’ve managed to work around them all so far, but these are places where even a custom implementation runs into current browser limitations. The good news is that at least some of these problems have proposed native solutions. It’s just a matter of time until they gain official support and then we’ll be able to swap them out. Transitions, transformations, and animations are a big part of modern web design. They provide affordances to help guide users and attract attention to important parts of the page, and generally just feel good when they’re done right. But when something moves around on the page, it’s surprisingly hard to know where it actually is at any given time, or if it’s even moving at all. Since we’re not rendering directly inline with the elements, we can’t just expect the animations to carry our ring along with them. Most of these work directly on individual elements, meaning only that element and its descendants are affected by the changes. Instead, we pretty much have to query the DOM for the new position of the element on every frame and re-render the ring accordingly. Doing something on every frame is not ideal. We can at least use requestAnimationFrame to make sure that updates are scheduled appropriately and avoid re-rendering when positions haven't changed, but the end result is unavoidably a constant loop that queries the DOM on every frame. We explored reducing the overhead of this by listening to animationstart and animationend events and only running the loop between those times, but because of how events and transforms the bubble through the DOM, it's not always guaranteed to update properly. What we really want from browsers here is a way of knowing when the layout of an element has changed and running a callback at that time. requestAnimationFrame lets you say something like \"I'm going to change something on the next frame\", but you can't currently do the inverse and say “let me know when something will be changing on the next frame” to be able to listen for those changes natively. Something like window.onAnimationFrame would be a wonderful addition here. However, it doesn’t currently look like there are any proposals for this kind of hook, meaning a real solution is unlikely to come any time soon. Our implementation works pretty well now, but there are still occasionally some lagged frames that would be nice to get rid of. For now, the result is still solid and it doesn’t seem possible to do much better. One of the original problems we called out about using a standard outline in CSS is that it is extremely limited in how you can customize it. While the shorthand looks a lot like border , you can't actually set an outline-radius or anything to adjust the offset of the outline from the element. Luckily, we’re not relying on those properties at all here. Since we’re explicitly rendering a distinct element to show the ring, we can do anything we want. But, that also means that we don’t inherit any of these properties from the target element either. Specifically, an accurate border-radius is one of the key things that makes the focus ring feel tight and properly integrated with the elements on the page. For example, a ring with a 4px radius would look out of place around a button with more rounded corners: Making this kind of adjustment turned out to be surprisingly simple. We already have the target element in the context, so while we’re querying for the position, we can also inspect the style of the element and pick up whatever radius it has set. Then, using some CSS custom properties, it can automatically adapt every time. Even better, the value returned by getComputedStyle will give the full shorthand value in case the radius is different for any individual sides of the element, so what might seem like weird cases will actually get handled by default, with no overhead for users to worry about. We can easily expand this same functionality to other properties like z-index in case an element is absolutely positioned, or for anything else in the future. This isn’t a problem that necessarily has a better solution. It’d be nice if outline had a corresponding outline-radius property or inherited from border-radius , but it wouldn't actually be usable in this case because of all the other problems with :focus and outline . Any amount of additional control would always be welcome. One of the last things we wanted to do was make sure that the focus ring that gets rendered is sufficiently visible on top of whatever background the target element is sitting on. For example, Discord often uses different colored backgrounds on user profiles to represent different statuses like playing a game, streaming, or listening to music. These colors don’t always play well with the default blue that we’re using for rings throughout the rest of the app. Instead, we want to be able to change the ring’s color to something like a translucent white, which is consistently visible and doesn’t visually clash with the background color. At a glance, this seems straightforward enough to implement: just like border-radius and z-index from earlier, we can just query the element and set a CSS property in response to whatever we find, right? But, at least in browsers today, there isn't a direct way to get the background color that an element is sitting on. You can find an element's background-color , but that's not the same thing. And just looking at the FocusRingScope container's background misses any cases where someone might just render a div with a background somewhere in between the ring and the scope. Thankfully there is still a way to do this, though it’s neither pretty nor efficient. The only currently-available way to accurately get the color behind an element is to manually traverse all of the ancestor elements and check their background colors. Even then, you have to do some math to composite the colors together in case there’s any opacity in them. The efficiency of this approach depends on how complicated and deep the target element’s DOM subtree is. Depending on how complicated of a DOM structure the element is within, this can be somewhat simple to do, or may involve a few dozen elements and a relatively slow DOM query for each one. While that’s a workable solution, there may actually be a better way in the near future: There’s a current discussion about adding a c urrentBackgroundColor value to CSS . This would ideally be queryable as well and would skip all of the manual ancestor traversal that is currently required. And another suggested feature in the CSS Color Level 5 draft is the color-contrast function , which would let authors specify a list of colors and have the browser automatically pick the most visible color. We only covered one small (but certainly not trivial) aspect of our entire Keyboard Navigation project here. While our primary goal was just to integrate keyboard navigation into the existing app, we also wanted to make sure we could maintain that baseline in the future and avoid most regressions as the app grows and evolves with time. All told, there were a number of other challenges that we had to solve, each with their own complications. Just a few examples of that additional work include creating new systems for automatically managing focus throughout the entire app, redesigning legacy features to make sure they can support proper semantics, and refactoring many of our core UI components to make sure they work with keyboards by default. While many of the situations we encountered were complicated, they generally had solutions that came about naturally. Focus Rings, though, presented a unique challenge where every simple solution failed to meet our requirements for quality and effectiveness. We exhausted all of the functionality that browsers currently provide natively and ended up having to build our own solution from scratch. Through all of this work, though, we learned a lot about the problem space for focus rings and potential ways that browsers could make this easier for everyone in the future. We’ve had some passing conversations about some of these problems with browser vendors already, and are hoping to see a collaborative effort with vendors and spec authors to turn these ideas into a real standard. In the meantime, if you’d like to see the nitty-gritty about how we actually solved these problems, or if you’re in need of a consistent focus ring for your own application, we’ve released all of the code as an open-source package! You can check that out on GitHub here . Keyboard navigation is a fundamental part of creating accessible experiences that everyone can enjoy, and we’re delighted to finally bring a complete, high-quality implementation into Discord. This is a project that touches every part of the app and creates an entirely new way for people to interact with it. We’re excited to see how users of all kinds can take advantage of this new way of navigating and are looking forward to future projects that will help us make Discord more accessible, more inclusive, and more available as the place to talk for everyone , regardless of their situation or abilities.

If you haven’t heard of Snowsgiving before, it’s the time of year where the Discord community from all reaches of the planet are brought together in a single server through the holiday spirit. We make new friends within the Snowsgiving server, run a massive amount of contests and giveaways, and give back by supporting a charitable organization that works to make the world a better place. Snowsgiving is a time to reflect upon the last year of experiences you’ve had through Discord, but 2020 hasn’t been quite a normal year. In addition to some great memories involving your closest friends, your Discord experiences this year may even include talking with your classmates, family members, and even a few digital convention attendees you met. Now, let’s get down to business and discuss everything that’s happening this year. Spoilers: It’s the biggest Snowsgiving we’ve ever held. First thing’s first: Use the invite below to join us in the Snowsgiving 2020 server below: https://discord.gg/snowsgiving Festivities will start on December 7th, but be sure to join as soon as possible. Musical performances will be streamed on our Twitch and YouTube pages, so we’ll keep you in the loop as soon as events start going on throughout the week on the Snowsgiving server. Below is everything we’ve got planned! All times are in PST: 5pm: Taylor Kade 6pm: Born Dirty 7pm: Kaskade 10am: AMA with Doctors Without Borders 5pm: Nakkia Gold 6pm: DJ Snoopadelic (intimate DJ set by Snoop Dogg) 7pm: DJ Skee (Outside The Matrix VR Set) 10am: Magical Nathaniel’s Mystical Magic Show 12pm: Contest Submissions Close 5pm: Taylor Jaymin 6pm: Sultan + Shepard 7pm: Deadmau5 10am: Virtual Petting Zoo with Tiny Tales to You 12pm: Nova Miller 1pm: Soulex 2pm: Good Times Ahead 3pm: Lion Babe 11:30am: Arca 4pm: Krewella 5pm: TOKiMONSTA And of course, daily giveaways for Snowsgiving merch, Wumpus plushies, headsets, and maybe even some consoles? Check out the end of the blog. For this year’s Snowsgiving, we’ll be running our annual charity drive in support of Doctors without Borders . This organization focuses on providing lifesaving medical humanitarian care to more than 70 countries around the world. Want to learn more about the work that Doctors without Borders do? On Tuesday, December 8th, starting around 10 am PST, the Snowsgiving server will host an AMA with Karen Stewart, a Mental Health Officer from Doctors Without Borders who will be answering your questions about what the charity does to help, mental health, and COVID-19. As for a fundraising goal? We’re stepping it up from previous years with a goal of $150,000 towards Doctors without Borders. If you donate at least $75, you’ll be able to claim one of these cozy winter sweaters! This is a special run of sweaters only available during Snowsgiving. There are only limited quantities of these, and once it’s gone, it’s gone for good! If you’re ready to keep warm with Wumpus, head on over to our Tiltify page to pitch in. Heads up: If you want to donate towards a sweater, be sure to select the sweater as your reward when going through the donation flow. On top of the funds raised through Tiltify , Discord will be making a $50,000 donation to Doctors without Borders , making our total goal for the Snowsgiving donation drive $200,000. Even though some events may not be happening 24 hours a day, that doesn’t mean the celebration has to stop! We’re partnering with the team at Dash Radio to provide entertainment throughout the entire week, not just during the “day” on our side of the globe. Hop inside the “Listen Along!” channel and groove to a special Snowsgiving playlist throughout the day. The team at Dash Radio will also be running exclusive Snowsgiving shows that will be broadcast on Discord’s Twitch and YouTube channels as well as Dash Radio’s Twitch channel . Throughout the week, guest artists including Kaskade, Deadmau5, TOKiMONSTA, DJ Snoopadelic (intimate DJ set by Snoop Dogg), and more will be stopping by to celebrate Snowsgiving in style. Want to listen along with the Snowsgiving community? We’ve made some special adjustments in the server to accommodate a whooole ton more people in a single voice channel than your average server, offering space for thousands of users in one voice channel so everyone can listen in… we hope. Among all the fun of contests and giveaways, it’s important to remember that Snowsgiving is a time to reflect upon the past and celebrate the many experiences you’ve shared with friends over Discord. Last year, we opened up a text channel for Server Boosters to share stories about what makes Discord so important in their lives. This year, we’re expanding to video and opening it up to everyone. We’re looking for a 60-second video story from anyone who has something they want to share with the world. Whether you’ve met a new friend through a Discord server, you’ve joined a great community who welcomed you in open arms, or you use Discord to connect with your closest companions via DMs, we’d love to hear it. You aren’t restricted to sitting in front of a camera either — it can be a drawing, animation, voiceover, anything that gets your story across in a way you’re proud of. Get creative! Everyone who submits a legitimate entry (aka: not a Rickroll) will receive 1 month of Discord Nitro. With your help, we hope to create a special Snowsgiving video after the event’s over containing some of the most heartwarming memories shared within the server. Check out the #discord-shorts channel in the Snowsgiving server for the full scoop. This contest is restricted to the United States, and entries will be accepted until 12:00 pm on Wednesday, December 9th. Storytelling doesn’t have to be through written words. If you’re the more visually creative type, we’ve got an opportunity for you as well in our Winter Wonderland art contest! Whether you use color pencils, paper mache, paint, or your favorite set of gel pens from your classroom, no matter your experience or skill level, we’d love to see what you create. Below are a few examples from last Snowsgiving to get you inspired. When you’ve got that spark you want to pursue and create the snowy scene of your dreams, head into the #winter-wonderland channel. Just like the Discord Shorts contest, this contest is restricted to the United States and entries will be accepted until 12:00 pm on Wednesday, December 9th. Just listing out all the shenanigans that’ll be happening doesn’t truly encompass the excitement and sometimes controlled chaos of Snowsgiving. We’ve saved trees, raised money for Child’s Play, and even broke our own giveaway bot last year from all the excitement. Even if you’re not interested in entering the competitions, or would rather let others try and win some prizes, we’d still love to hang out with you throughout the week. The hedgehogs would love to meet you as well. But if you are interested in giveaways and you’ve been on the hunt for some next-gen consoles, I hear we may be a few give out, including this fully-stacked Xbox Series X bundle containing 1 year of Game Pass Ultimate, 1 Year of Discord Nitro, and Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla Ultimate Edition. In addition to the Xbox Series X bundle, we’ve also got a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition bundle , with a copy of Godfall, Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, and 1 Year of Discord Nitro! Let’s end this crazy year together and make help a difference in the world.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "fostering a thriving partner worthy community on discord", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/fostering-a-thriving-partner-worthy-community-on-discord-7ebc9393a52a", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Update for 12/22/2020: The Discord Moderator Academy has launched! We’ve reflected this in the “Improving Your Moderation” section. We plan to update this blog with even more advice and pointers as new app features and programs are introduced. Any changes will be mentioned right here on the top. Are you looking to join the Discord Partner Program ? Have you yearned to reach the ranks of Partnership and reward your community for being so gosh-darned wonderful to each other? Becoming a Discord Partner is a huge milestone for many communities throughout the world. But don’t go running into the settings page of your brand new server expecting to apply on day one! The Partner Program has some requirements your community will need to satisfy before you can apply. In this post, we’ll shed some light on what makes a good Partnered community by sharing expert tips, explaining what our metrics mean, and demonstrating what we look for when reviewing new applications. We hope the advice shared here will help your community soar to new heights! Before we dive deeper, take a good look at the Discord Partnership Requirements . We’re going to be referring back to them, so you’ll need to understand those before continuing to read. Once you’ve done a read-through, we can cover one of the first requirements for a Partnered server: 50 active “communicators.” So what exactly is a “communicator?” After all, Discord is a chat platform… you use it to communicate, right? That’s pretty much the idea! In the Partner Program, a “communicator” refers to anyone who posts a message in a text channel or talks in a voice channel . The person who drops a simple “hey” in your general chat is a communicator. So is the person belting it out during karaoke night. Having enough active communicators is the first sign your server’s going places. That means your goal is to encourage server members to post and talk more! Get users to talk to each other, not just comment on what’s going on or what they’re seeing. Don’t just expand your server to include that one #dog-pics channel everyone’s been longing for: inspire them to discuss, share, and interact in there. Your channels should give communicators the chance to start and maintain ongoing conversations, no matter what the subject matter. Want more ways to reach your communicators? Let them tell you what they want to talk about! Give your communities more opportunities to express what they want to see from your server. If there’s interest in a topic, give people a chance to explore it. Note that giving users the chance to discuss more things doesn’t necessarily mean turning your community into one big “general chat.” When our team checks out your server, what we love to see are active and thriving conversations about subjects you’re all passionate about: ie, the subjects your community was founded on. Is your server about this one anime you can’t stop watching? Backpacking weekends? A home for your gaming channel’s followers? Whatever brought your community together, don’t be afraid to keep the focus on it: that’s what will keep everyone coming back! The second part of the Partnership Requirements asks for at least 100 “participators” per week. “ Participating” is any active or passive engagement with your server; viewing, reading discussions, posting messages, and reacting to posts are all participating. As long as they’re opening up and checking out your server, they count. Side note: “Communicators” count as “Participators” since they’re, well… participating! Those 50 will be included in your needed 100 participators. Not everyone is comfortable diving into every conversation, just like not everyone is comfortable being the life of the party. It’s important to offer everyone ways to participate, regardless of how shy or outgoing they are. Even when they’re not up to posting much, lurkers often like to feel like they’re part of the community. Some servers offer “#introduce-yourself” channels, which are a great way to let shy users who don’t want to interrupt conversations in the #general-chat. Tell everyone who’s behind that adorable Shiba Inu icon. (Did you know they drew it themselves?) Additionally, it’s great to let your community have a choice of what server news or events they get notified for. That will encourage them to check out the server when relevant news is announced instead of just tuning out notifications without looking. You can help users get the pings they want by assigning them to special roles that members can opt into or out of. Unsure how to get a self-assignable role established? We’ll mention a few useful bots in the Moderation section. For servers that are actively growing, the Discord Partner Program has a new member retention requirement. As stated in the Partnership Requirements article, servers that are actively growing must reach “at least a 20% Week 1 Retention over an 8 week period.” To put that another way: out of the last 5 people that joined your server, at least one of them has to stick around after the first week. If your rate is lower than 20%, you may need to take a step back and figure out why. Gathering feedback from newer members who *are* sticking around is a great way to understand what’s working. If you know of a few members who haven’t posted or participated in a while but check the server, try reaching out to them to understand why they aren’t checking in with the community as often. They may have some insights you haven’t considered. For a more in-depth investigation, you may even try “joining” your own server! Make a fresh account (or ask a friend to join) and observe your onboarding experience firsthand. Was it easy to know where to go to chat? Are the rules visible and clearly explained? Did anyone reply when the newest member said “hey!” as they joined, or did the server stay pretty quiet? All of these can help you figure out how to make your server a more welcoming place. So far, so good. You’ve got plenty of users, consistent participators and communicators, and new members are sticking around and making friends. Now that your community has grown to be pretty active, let’s take a closer look at what kind of content we’re looking for in your server. Reaching the requirements to apply for Partnership is just the first step in the application process. When our team reviews your application, we’ll be using the invite supplied to hop into your server directly and see what it’s all about. That means we’ll take away the same first impression as any other user, so think about what we’ll find when we join. How will your server come off: like a free-for-all, or like a community ? One way to create a healthy, cooperative community is to involve users regularly in events. Maybe run a contest to determine something that affects everyone, like your next server banner. Or, host an event that gets people hopping into voice channels and getting to know one other. Help people feel like they’re part of something and they’ll make it a better place to be a part of. You may also want to look for other, similar servers who might be interested in collaborating with yours! When two communities “trade” users, neither loses; you both make new friends, and if you’ve put in the work, a lot of them will stick around. And don’t worry: becoming a Partnered server isn’t a competition. If there’s more than one application revolving around the same subject, and both are reaching Partnership requirements and creating a great place to talk, they can both be Partnered — no problem. If you’re looking towards Partnership, your community needs to abide by the Discord Partner Code of Conduct . In other words, it’s not enough to have an active server — you’ve got to keep it from going off the deep end! It may look like a lot’s going on in the Partner Code of Conduct, but as a rule, it can be boiled down to the Golden Rule: “treat others how you want to be treated.” If something does end up happening in your Partnered community that involves a CoC violation, we’ll work with you to make sure your mod team is aware of the development so that things run smoothly in the future. Interested in getting set up with some more advanced moderation tools? The community-favorite bots Dyno , Mee6 , Zira , or GiselleBot are great starts for moderation help (and can make you those self-assignable roles we mentioned earlier). But for real pro-quality moderation that’s tailored to your community’s needs, you can’t beat a home-made bot: check in with the Discord Developers server if you need some guidance crafting your own. If you’re really looking to step up your moderation game, you’ll want to dig into the Discord Moderator Academy . It’s an in-depth curriculum for prospective server mods that touches on moderation decisions, learning to resolve conflicts, and safeguarding your community. Check it out at discord.com/moderation . These tips and guidelines will hopefully get you started on your way towards Partnership, but at the end of the day, it’s up to you to make your community all it can be. You know your server, you know your moderation, and you know your users: do what you can to make them shine! Help us see the best version of your community! Work to create an environment where people are excited to see what’s going on, whether they check in every few minutes or every couple of days. And have fun… because if you’re not having fun, chances are they aren’t either! We hope this post will be the beginning of many, many happy Partnerships. Once you think your community is ready, apply directly within your Discord server and we’ll take a look. The discord.com/partners page will show you exactly how the application process works. Are you an existing Partner with ideas or feedback that could be helpful for this post to inspire future Partners? We’d love to hear your input!

No matter what your skill level, there’s plenty of thriving communities ready to give you feedback, swap tips, or just share in all your favorite creations. We reached out to five incredibly talented artists and asked each to make a special piece depicting Discord and what it means to them. We’d love to share their work and experiences with you! 💖 Ilya is from Russia but wound up living and working in Tokyo. When your friends are on the other side of the continent, it’s important to have a place to talk, play, and work with them: for Ilya, that place is Discord. This illustration encompasses an average day on Discord for Ilya: illustrating, gaming, and talking with close friends. Ilya’s friend Serezha sometimes streams his painting through Discord, which gives Ilya the chance to give him tips and guide him through the process. It’s a great opportunity to throw around ideas and experiment, from “how about we add more shadows here” to “it would be cool to add that to the background.” When not drawing, Ilya uses Discord all the time, whether it’s just for talking or spectating friends playing single-player games using Go Live. “The most casual is when we talk while Serezha’s sharing the screen of him painting, sometimes commenting on the piece he’s working on like ‘hey can you get back a couple of steps? I think it looked better in the green.’ Even when we’re in our own rooms on opposite sides of the planet, we can still be together thanks to Discord.” Sounds great! One more question, Illya: How do we get a pair of those sweet headphones? Ilya’s Instagram is the home for a lot more incredible work. “I use Discord with my partner. When we are apart we use it to share art ideas, talk or see each other. We often send sketches to hear each other’s feedback stay in touch.” Using real-life as an inspiration, Larienne created this adorable piece depicting a long-distance relationship: a couple physically separated but staying connected through Discord. Larienne wanted to make something “way more relevant in a world where the Covid pandemic drastically limits the possibility of travel. It shows how a tender moment between a couple using Discord to connect and still see each other even while separated.” There are some adorable touches throughout the scene. If you look to the left, there’s a framed photo of the couple, patiently waiting for the moment when they’ll see each other again. Larienne regularly posts work on Instagram and Twitter . Look around and you might even find a special animated version of this Discord-themed piece! Chris McCoy started the Safely Endangered series on Webtoon in December 2014, but he’s been drawing comics for a lot longer. Like, since he was doodling on his school textbooks. After spending the year in isolation, Chris has found a second home in Discord: a place to stay in touch with both real-life friends and fans of Safely Endangered. “ I had a few funny ideas rattling around in my head for this comic. After speaking with the Discord team, I got the feeling they wanted a truly authentic piece.” “My server is a great place to talk about my work, my process, and my ideas with fans and other artists, so I started sketching ideas based on my personal experience with Discord and voila! I think this comic touches on that notion pretty accurately and I’m really happy about how it turned out.” We can relate! Plenty of us at the (virtual) Discord office have also hopped into voice channels to bounce ideas off each other, even before social distancing. You’d be surprised how similar this looks to a day of work for us. In addition to the Safely Endangered website, you can see more of the series on Instagram . Hailing from the Netherlands, Laura (otherwise known as Cyarine) drew something nice and cozy — a scene of hanging out at home, checking in with friends over Discord. Cyarine’s drawing depicts two familiar scenarios: a late-night server session curled up in the computer chair and a casual, more personal conversation on the phone. Laura explains: “Everyone is used to our new, pretty isolated ‘normal’ which was very much the norm for me growing up, living in a group home, and not going to school. Being used to staying in touch online my friendships from then, and new ones too, all got closer on Discord.” “I just had a sliver enough of self-respect to not draw myself passed out with Discord still running in the background, cause more often than I’d like to admit my friends from other timezones have woken me up in the middle of the night, but that could have made it more realistic hahaha.” Yeah…I think we’ve all been there. You can check out more great pieces (and the merch shop!) by visiting Laura’s Instagram and Twitter . James Lewis has been sharing art on social media since the age of 16: not just finished pieces, but the process of creating itself. Viewers worldwide have followed not just the brush strokes and finishing touches, but the experience of watching a young artist grow with every creation. “I’m blessed to be living out what was just a dream 9 years ago,” says James, who in that span of time has gathered millions of dedicated followers and supporters. James took the time to create this adorable piece. “The whimsical approach to the painting matches well with the light-hearted and fun community experiences of using Discord.” “The painting I worked on shows the Discord mascot, Wumpus floating in the heavens between two physically isolated plots of land. The mascot floating with the balloon being the centerpiece visually connects the two islands, similar to how the platform connects people all around the world.” We’ve had this video on repeat for ages. How does he make it look so easy? You can head over to James’s website, jamesllewis.com , or visit Instagram and TikTok to see mesmerizing videos of the creative process. — - We hope you enjoyed these pieces as much as we did. By sharing them with you, we’ve reminded you of the heartfelt moments you’ve shared with friends, loved ones, and even strangers all around the world. We recently asked on Twitter for some unique moments you’ve experienced throughout this year. If you’ve got your own story to tell or a small but meaningful moment that’s always meant a lot to you, we’d love to hear it.

This time we’re checking in with the community built around musicians Domi Louna and JD Beck, a duo lauded by Vice as “freakishly talented jazz wizards.” While not preparing for the release of their first album, the two take to Discord to talk music, games, and basically everything else with more than six thousand members of their community. Domi and JD Beck kicked off their server in the Summer of 2020, not long after COVID-19 made in-person performances and meetups difficult for musicians all over. The two were already using Discord to keep in touch and play games with their friends, so their manager suggested they start up a public server for their growing fanbase. But as the community grew, Domi and JD began to realize they hadn’t just made a fan server: they’d created a thriving, vibrant community for musicians and music-lovers of all kinds. “We thought users would have to know about us to join the server, but as soon as we launched it had a few thousand people joined all with different backgrounds, cultures, tastes in music, and relationships with the artistic field. It’s become more of a platform where people recognize creativity and love to open their minds to other sources of inspiration as well as listening to music.” From the moment new users arrive in “domi + jd beck,” it’s clear that the server is as much for music makers as fans of the duo. As soon as you join you’re presented with a wide array of roles to represent ways you might make music, from drums and guitars to the Digital Audio Workstation. There’s even a role available if your at-home meditation sessions include singing bowls . Once you’re all set up, don’t feel shy about jumping into a conversation: the server works hard to make sure the latest arrivals aren’t singled out. As the duo explains it, “ I feel welcome somewhere new if I’m not targeted or treated weirdly because I’m new. So on our Discord, a lot of new users just hop on a discussion already going on and nobody cares to know if they’re new or not! And our mods are very helpful with easing discussions. We also like to chat with people so don’t be scared to type. ” The longer you stick around, the more thoughtful features you’ll come across. The moderation team has set up a music bot in three dedicated channels so the community always has things to listen to. A custom bot integrates directly with Spotify’s API, letting you examine the finest details about any song: the tempo, the key it’s played in, even the exact time signature. From off-the-cuff chats to detail-oriented deep-dives, it’s a music-lover’s paradise. But there’s more to the community than talking shop and sharing your favorite tunes. If you’re interested in really taking your own music to the next level, the Domi + JD Beck server has you covered with their in-depth workshops. Workshops are a place for aspiring and experienced musicians alike to learn something new, brush up their techniques, and get into the finer points of their favored instruments. So far, there have been two labs for the Synthesizer and one for mastering the Guitar and Bass, both of which were smash hits. You may be asking yourself: “Live labs? In a big Discord server? How do dozens of people in a single voice channel manage to run a workshop? Wouldn’t everyone talk over each other?” Turns out: nope! As Domi + JD point out, when the speaker starts talking, everyone mutes themselves until it’s time for questions. No snags, no need for a moderator to step in: just common courtesy and the desire to learn. That’s how you know you’ve got a great community on your hands. “I think it’s good to have personal elements like workshops and labs because it’s really specific to what we do as musicians. Not a lot of Discord servers use their platform as a free knowledge resource with voice chat, video channels, and techy visualizations.” It’s an incredible feat to make a community with 6,000 members feel just as close as a hangout with your best friends, and even more amazing to handle it while putting together your hotly-anticipated debut album, but Domi and JD have pulled it off. Pretty dang well, in fact. Even though their server is great for hardcore music-lovers, you don’t have to be a musician or even know anything about music to become part of the community. Anyone’s welcome to hang out and chat. As Domi and JD themselves put it: Watch, read, type, answer, and talk as much as you want. It’s your space. Don’t be shy. :) You can join their community at discord.gg/domiandjdbeck . Their first album is set to release in 2021. (But you can’t rush perfection.) Psst: Before we go, the server’s mod team gave us the inside scoop on a big giveaway planned for next year with some help from Nord , makers of Domi’s keyboard! Keep an eye out for something in January 2021. The Community Spotlight is an ongoing series showcasing the coolest, most unique communities on Discord.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how to prepare for your discord interview", "author": ["Mark Smith"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-to-prepare-for-your-discord-interview-9a8ff82a6fe2", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com This piece is primarily focused on applying for a position within our Engineering department, but most of it is the same for roles across the company. Discord’s vision is a world where everyone belongs . Part of creating that world is building a team of people passionate about what we’re doing, with the skills & knowledge to help us get there. Our CEO, Jason, wrote more about our approach to building teams in his blog, The Four Values of Working at Discord . We know that interviewing can be a daunting prospect at the best of times. However, we also understand that information disparity is one of the ways that the majority’s privilege is reinforced. In this blog post, we hope to be completely transparent on how the hiring gears turn within Discord to give everyone that applies an equal chance at joining the team. At a high level, the Discord interview process typically moves quickly — as quick as you need it to! — and goes through these steps: Resume Review. You submit an application to one of our open roles, which is reviewed by our recruiting team, who selects people to talk to. Alternately, we may have reached out to you directly, in which case you’ve already passed the resume review. Fancy you! Recruiter Screen. One of our recruiters will reach out and set up a time to talk to get to you know a bit and ask some of our more standard questions, such as are you eligible to work in the US, what are your compensation needs, and so on. Hiring Manager Screen. This is your first chat with the manager who is hiring for the particular role. We’ll go through a set of questions about your background and what you’re looking for at Discord. The goal is to make sure that this will be a good role fit, and if not, we’ll try to find one within Discord that is. Skills Test. This is a one-hour session with one of our engineers and is a coding interview. We’ll dive more into this later. Full-day Interview. This is the big one: A full panel that you should plan to dedicate about 5–6 hours to, including a lunch break. The panel typically includes the following sessions: Values. This is our chance to learn more about what motivates you and how you handle feedback, conflict, personal growth. Attitude. In this session, we put you with a couple of Discord staff outside of the team you’re applying to. They’ll get to know you better, learn more about whatever you’re passionate about, and see how you work with people from different roles. Coding. There are typically 1 to 2 coding sessions spaced between interviews. Architecture. We’ll hold 1 to 2 architecture sessions for mid to senior roles to see you work through requirements gathering and designing a solution at a high level. Specialty. For certain roles or more senior roles, we will add a specialty interview session. More on this later. Following the full-day interview, the team will gather together to share the results of their interview sessions with each other. As a group, we will then decide on whether or not to proceed. From the full-day interview to the final decision, we move quickly and let you know the result within a few business days. We believe that an effective interview process is designed to evaluate whether you can do the actual job, and not based on trivia or trickery. This theme will come up in each of our sessions that we talk about in detail below. We strongly value attributes such as empathy and working together effectively. Many of our interviews include assessing this through various means — the way you engage with other roles, the way you collaborate in technical sessions, and so on. We don’t expect you to be 100% extroverted (many of us aren’t!), but the ability to work together is critical to our team. Finally, many of us aren’t gamers. This is probably the top misconception about working at Discord. It is not expected or required that you be a gamer (of any kind) to work here. Instead, the things we look for are people who care about the mission and can work together effectively to achieve it. Now, let’s talk about how we figure that out. This is a discussion interview usually administered by one of our more senior managers or other company leaders. The goal of this interview is to figure out what motivates you and how you approach conflict, feedback, and other skills that are useful to building a small and mighty team. Discord is a mission-driven organization. Yes, we’re working to build a successful business around that mission, but ultimately we’re here because we believe in the vision of Discord and working together to give people the power to create belonging in their lives. It is important to us that anybody we hire is here because they believe in that mission — and so the Values interview will dig into that. We also want to understand what drives you. Why’d you become an engineer? How do you approach personal growth and learning? What other companies are you interviewing at and why? (We promise we won’t be sad if you’re interviewing at other places at the same time.) Another tip for this interview: since this is typically given by one of our more senior managers or leaders, this is a great session to ask your big-picture questions. Ask about the vision, our monetization strategy, our culture, etc. This interview is a great opportunity for you to interview us and make sure Discord aligns with your own values! If you extrapolate our vision out to workplace culture, it’s probably no surprise to learn that we care a lot about the kind of place we’re creating at Discord. In this session, we’ll team you up with a couple of Discord employees from other parts of the business. If you are applying for an engineering role, your Attitude session will likely include someone from Customer Experience, Marketing, Business Development, Trust and Safety, Design, or one of the many other roles we have at the company. We want all of our employees to feel that they belong. During the session, the team will ask mostly conversational questions, such as what does everybody do, how did they get to Discord, and why apply at Discord? Outside of Discord, we’ll also ask things like what’s their current job like, how did they work with past teams, and so on. Interacting with other parts of the company is an expectation of all of our roles. Our engineers interface with staff from other teams constantly, and it’s important that anybody we hire be able to do the same effectively. Gamers, artists, makers, horticulturists, soft-serve ice cream enthusiasts, musicians, singers — we have a diverse set of interests across the company and are excited to learn about yours! All of our technical interview questions are designed to be based upon real work we’ve done, and problems that have come up in the past. We don’t ask you to build self-balancing red-black trees in our interviews or describe RAID levels off the top of your head. Trivia has no place in our interviews when we’re still trying to answer the important question of: can this person do the actual job? After we’ve created an example question, we test it internally with several engineers at different levels of experience, with a variety of backgrounds, and put together an evaluation rubric that objectively defines what we’re looking for. We try to be specific about what we expect people to do. Some examples of the many things that are on some of our grading rubrics include: Implemented feature X successfully to specifications. Understood and demonstrated concurrent programming concepts. Chosen software architecture that would support adding unit tests without major refactor. If the candidate has no experience with a technology, they were able to use and understand API documentation effectively. An interesting part of trying to simulate the actual job, though: use of Google, Stack Overflow, and API docs is expected. We think it’s a bad sign if you don’t use all of the resources at your disposal! Oftentimes, this can include bouncing your ideas off the interviewer. Consider them as a team member you can collaborate with and gain valuable feedback for the task at hand. While they won’t write the code for you, don’t hesitate to share how you’re thinking through the project and ask for their input or thoughts. You can expect to do a coding challenge for your skills test for most roles , then one or two coding sessions in the full-day interview. For more senior candidates, we reduce the coding and replace them with architecture sessions. The specific goals of our coding interviews are to provide practical problems and then see you actually solve them . The format of the interview is similarly practical. We’ll ask you to use your laptop and be prepared to use whatever your favorite IDE, tools, and programming language are. We want to see you at your best, writing in whatever way you’re used to. If the interview is being done remotely, you’ll need to do a screen share so our interviewer can follow along. While solving the problem, use all of your standard resources. Google, API documentation, your environment, the interviewer, and anything you traditionally use yourself! This is part of how engineers really work at HQ, and we think the interview should be no different. Our coding problems have an evaluation rubric that includes: Does the code compile & run properly, and does it fulfill the question’s requirements? Do you understand the code you just wrote, including potential runtime analysis? You should know if something is constant time, linear time, or worse. Given the interview’s time constraints, are you aware of any tradeoffs you made in writing it? How effectively did you use your environment and resources? Are you comfortable in your editor and in the language you chose? If it was a problem with stages, how did you approach refactoring your solution to consider the new requirements? Is the code well abstracted such that it could be tested, whether you wrote tests during the session? Again, please do talk to your interviewer. You’re more than welcome to ask for feedback as you go, such as when you’re considering a few possible implementation paths. Similar to the coding interview, Architecture sessions are designed to see what it’d be like to work with you to design a solution to a problem we’ve actually solved or could anticipate solving down the road. The interviewer will give you a problem statement, such as “design a URL shortener” and then let you take the reins. We only give architecture questions to people with industry experience, such as senior-level candidates, so we expect you to have done some design in previous roles. To succeed here, you’ll need to ask a lot of questions. You should work to fully understand the scope required of the solution, what success looks like, and what the valid tradeoffs are in the design. Hint: every design will have tradeoffs! We recommend spending a few minutes talking through some possible designs and sketching them out on the whiteboard (or in a beautiful sketch in Microsoft Paint if you’re doing this remotely). Depending on the particular question, this may involve talking about code architecture, systems design, data modeling, or any number of similar areas. Work closely with the interviewer to make sure you’re going in a good direction and the decisions you’re making are aligned with the task’s requirements. Your interviewer is an expert in the problem domain, so you should leverage their knowledge to help you make appropriate tradeoffs. If you are not asking questions and checking in, it will be hard to succeed at this session. Look before you leap! We are not evaluating your knowledge of the problem domain. If we ask you to design a system to route calls to the best available backend, but you have no experience with WebRTC, that’s absolutely fine. We’ll be there to help. Instead, we’ll be evaluating on: How thoroughly you understood the requirements. Did you ask good questions, seek clarification, and incorporate that into your design? What tradeoffs you made and why. Were they appropriate to the hypothetical needs of the customer for this problem? Simplicity. We strongly value choosing both the simplest and best solution that solves the problem, but with an eye towards growth. Will it work at 2x and 10x scale? If not, why? Clarity in communication. Were you able to effectively describe your chosen architecture and explain it to the interviewer? There are two main specialty sessions at this point, but we will add more as it makes sense. We still follow the same guidance for any of our interviews, of course, and try to make them objective with a documented success criteria. The Troubleshooting session is used by the Infrastructure department, designed to see you handle a production incident. We’ll give you a very simple infrastructure diagram with some databases, caches, and web servers, then set up a precipitating event: you get the dreaded page. The engineer administering the question will then simulate the world for you. You can ask for anything you want, such as dashboards or graphs, or even ask to SSH in to a machine to run some commands and look around. Of course, since we don’t believe in trivia problems, we don’t expect you to remember command line arguments or anything, but a general idea of what top would tell you could be useful here. “Getting to root cause” is not an expected outcome of the Troubleshooting session. Most people don’t. If you do, it’s usually because you got lucky and happened to look in the one place that had the critical clue. We’re more interested in seeing your approach to the process and how you understand what’s going on, not whether or not you fix the issue. Finally, the Project Retrospective session is typically given to management candidates and very senior engineers who might become tech leads one day. The goal here is to understand your approach to getting better over time. We value our ability to try things and learn from them — failure happens and is expected sometimes, the important part is how you learned from that failure! We’ll ask you to walk us through a recent project that you shipped where you played the role of leader. We want to hear about the project itself from start to finish, and see your analysis of how it went. When reflecting on your past project, you should consider how well you understood and describe the success criteria and whether you hit them. What was your understanding of the tradeoffs you made in the project and why they were being made? Following that project, have you incorporated your learnings and for future projects, and how do you lead your team and keep them aligned, motivated, and engaged? At the end of the day, an interview day at Discord is your opportunity to learn about us and make sure that you have what you need to make an informed choice if you get an offer. The most important part, however, is to know what you want. If you go into your interview process in any company with a clear set of your needs and goals, you’ll be more successful in getting them. Do you want a mission driven organization, or are you more passionate about liquid compensation? Do you want to be a manager at some point? Do you want to lead a team? Second, ask lots of questions. We’ve said it a lot, but this is truly one of the most valuable ways to figure out if Discord is right for you. You’ll have access to a dozen people from all kinds of roles. Ask what they like, ask what they don’t, and ask follow up questions. And third, be clear about what you need and what you want. If you’ve evaluated your situation and realized that what you want is mentorship to become a manager, tell us that! If you have specific compensation minimums you need based on your life situation, that’s also helpful to share early so we can tell you immediately if it’s even doable for us. We wouldn’t want you to spend a whole 5 to 6 hour day interviewing if it isn’t something you can accept an offer for. This is as much your process as it is ours , and we treat the interview as a collaborative effort. We’re happy to do our best to work with you, just let us know what you need, and we’ll see what we can do. Good luck in your search!

It’s a bonafide beastly bash! 2020 isn’t like every year though… what was once a hustling bustling holiday may be nothing more a silent spooky sight for many places in the world. Perhaps you already live in the middle of a frightening forest or desert that’s never had trick-or-treaters. Or maybe Halloween isn’t celebrated where you live, but it’s been your dream to stalk for sugary snacks. We want to help bring a trick-or-treating experience to EVERYONE, no matter where your haunted house resides. To help, we’re launching a special limited-time Halloween bot called Trick’cord Treat that anyone can use to bring some seasonal specters to your server. You can add the Trick’cord Treat bot at the following link: dis.gd/add-trickcordtreat Once you add our Halloween bot to your server, 40 trick-or-treaters will start knockin’ on your door for some sweet treats. Don’t worry, they’re not actual random people joining! It’s a game based on speed, with whoever giving a treat to the guest first receiving an item for their game inventory. The items to collect range from common trinkets such as Hairball to ultra-rare collectibles like a Miniature Crown. The bot can show a scoreboard of who’s closest to completing their collection of trick-or-treat prizes, and whoever has the most items in your server will be given a special role called the “Champion of Halloween!” Only one person can have this role, so gather some more items and take their orange crown from them! Trick’cord Treat will remain active until November 2nd, 2020, giving you a couple of days to finish your item collection while devouring the last of your Halloween candy. (Save me one of the Cadbury Flakes, will ya?) In order to get the Trick’cord Treat bot added to your server, you’ll need to have the “Manage Server” permission in the server you want to add it in . Make sure you have permission to add it before doing so! First, use this link to open the bot-adding page : dis.gd/add-trickcordtreat Once you click the link above, you’ll see a screen like the one below. Select the server you want to add Trick’cord Treat to and give the bot its required permissions. Finally, specify which channel the bot can chat in . Use the following command to tell the bot where to talk: h!config enable #channel_name Replace the “#channel_name” with the channel you’d like the bot to use to chat, and you’re done! You can add as many or as few channels as you’d like. Here’s a handy list of Trick’cord Treat bot commands for you and your community reference while you’re treat huntin’: h!trick or h!treat : When someone arrives at your door, give ’em a treat (or trick)! h!inventory: Shows you all the collectibles you’ve gathered. h!leaderboard: Displays the scores of how your server members are performing. h!help: Provides options for setting up Trick’cord Treat in your server. h!support: Brings you to the Trick’cord Treat Help Center article. h!invite: Shares the bot’s invite link so others can add it to their servers. h!config enable #channel: Allows Trick’cord Treat to post in the specified channel h!config disable #channel: Blocks Trick’cord Treat posting in the specified channel h!config role: Will attempt to recreate the Champion of Halloween role if the first attempt is unsuccessful. If you end up needing any additional help when setting up and using Trick’cord Treat, check out our Trick’cord Treat support article . Phobia Warning: One of the trick-or-treaters is a spider, hidden among a plethora of werewolves, witches, and Wumpuses. If anyone in your server is deathly afraid of spiders or similar monsters, you might want to give them a heads up that these creatures may pop up in chat once in a while. We hope our bot helps bring a bit of the frightening festivities back into your Halloween season! Keep an eye out on Halloween day, where we might have another scary surprise. 🎃 Imagine a Place 1.6K 32 Community 1.6K claps 1.6K 32 Written by Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses.

We want to help make the place you spend your time with more fun, giving you more ways to customize and personalize your Discord experience and improve upon how you connect with your friends and communities. Today we’re happy to finally share the newest product we’ve been working on — Stickers! We’ve been super excited about this feature for quite a while now. Stickers originally started as an internal Hack Week project back in the Summer of 2019, where a few of our own dedicated sticker-obsessed employees went as far as to make an internal prototype of what stickers could be on Discord. Personal expression is something we deeply care about here. Cropping the perfect avatar, setting your custom status using your own self-made emoji, and finding just the right blob to use in certain situations is part of what makes Discord special. We think Stickers will be a great addition to the many ways you can express yourself within Discord. Continuing to incorporate user feedback has helped us build and evolve products — like Nitro and Boosting — into products that match our users’ values. From increasing Nitro’s upload limit to 100mb and lowering the number of boosts needed to hit specific levels, we listen to the community’s feedback and use it to improve the experience of everyone on the platform. To help make sure we can refine and evolve our products to the best they can be, sometimes we also rely on slower rollouts. We care about user feedback, and doing slow releases/gated releases ensures that we’re making the space to hear our community directly. Stickers will follow this process, first rolling out to a singular region. Starting today, Canadian users on desktop and iOS will be able to access stickers with Android coming soon. We want to hear from our community on how they’ve enjoyed, or haven’t enjoyed, stickers, gather valuable feedback, and incorporate their ideas and feedback prior to global release around the world. Along with rolling out features to everyone, we also want to make good on our promise of giving our Nitro subscribers more ways to express themselves and customize their experience. Nitro’s designed to bring extra features and fun to help make Discord yours, and we’re excited to be adding some new Sticker-centric perks so you can continue doing just that. When Stickers releases, both current and future Nitro & Classic subscribers can claim the “What’s Up Wumpus” sticker pack for free, permanently. We’ve also added a few unique perks for those who have an active Discord Nitro subscription: You’ll receive a 33% discount on all sticker purchases while you’re subscribed, and you can claim an exclusive “ Wumpus Nitro Elite ” sticker pack to use while you have an active subscription. We’re very excited to share it with our Canadian community starting today, with our global audience coming soon. If you’re a Canadian Nitro subscriber, you can head into the new sticker shop right now to add these free sticker packs to your collection and start using them! We care deeply about creating paid additions that provide enhanced value to your Discord experience, making connecting with friends and communities more delightful while keeping the core product free. Stickers are the next step in that direction, and we’re very excited to share it with our Canadian community today — with our global audience coming soon. If you’re one of the lucky Canadians that get to try out stickers first, we’d love to know what you think. Let us know by reaching out to us on Twitter , Instagram , or through our feedback forum . If you have further questions about stickers and how they work, check out our handy Help Center article for more of the finer details.

This series is all about putting the spotlight on communities that are up to something different, special, or just plain cool. This time we’re telling the world about the “Fantasy Football Chat” Partnered Discord community at discord.gg/fantasyfootball . Whether you’re looking for fantasy football resources, advice from fellow players, or all-new leagues to join, Fantasy Football Chat is ready to bring you into the (fantasy) huddle. Server owner SpaceGhostForce (or Zach if you know him personally) used to be a moderator for the r/FantasyFootball community. The mod team mailbox would overflow with messages asking when the subreddit would finally get its own Discord server. Zach knew Discord would give them a great place to hold continuous discussions, so he took it on himself to start one up for the community. In two short years, Zach grew the Fantasy Football Chat to nearly 7,000 members. At the time of writing, the server maintains 52 server boosts, and just recently, the FFC community was accepted into the Discord Partner Program . Zach says the hardest part wasn’t just maintaining their established community, but expanding and improving their fantasy football experiences over time. The server’s scope has expanded to include regular community events, AMAs, and numerous contests, sponsored directly by external fantasy sports industry icons. It’s because of all these features that Zach recommends reading the rules before diving right into a chat. That’s good advice wherever you go on Discord, but the FFC takes orienting new members especially seriously. “Take a moment to get a bead on the culture in the server,” Zach advises. “We use ranks and corresponding colors to track who’s been active. This is effective in helping our older users recognize when new individuals join the server, and pointing them to the right channels or answering questions.” Fantasy Football can be pretty daunting to get into. After checking out the server’s general Information channels for necessary info, such as rules and server announcements, you can hop into the Chats category to introduce yourself and get your feet wet in the hobby. Once you’re ready to head into the real discussions and debates, the Head Coach category has 13 channels for team-specific discussions. Focused Discussion is the home for theory crafting and fantasy football strategies, plus an advanced analytic chat for the most in-depth discussions. For those who just want to read up on what’s happening, the all-important Resource Center category has 14 different channels for reputable expert newsfeeds and resources, along with specific channels for their sponsors and affiliates. Fantasy Football Chat helps reach out to new users with its own YouTube , Twitter , and even a podcast feed for the community. Bringing a taste of their Discord’s community experience into the outside world helps spread the word of the server further than just word of mouth can manage. Twice a week, the Fantasy Football Chat server holds live AMA sessions with industry professionals and fantasy football community leaders such as Andy Holloway, co-host of the Fantasy Footballers Podcast, and Doug Moore, writer for Gridiron Experts and PFN365. The truly competitive can sign up for community tournaments, with an entire Discord Tournament section allowing members to compete and see who ends with the best roster this season. For those who miss the live events, the previously-mentioned YouTube , Twitter , and podcast feed provide a way to enjoy the Q&A session while doing other stuff, like watching a live NFL game and hoping nothing happens to your star player. Future AMAs planned in the Fantasy Football Chat include staff from 4for4, FantasyPros, and The Undroppables. Whether you have a passing interest in fantasy football or you’re already a hardcore enthusiast, Fantasy Football Chat is a thriving community that’ll welcome you with open arms. The community covers so much ground and offers so many features that it’s bound to become a daily part of your fantasy season. Now, who at the Discord office can we get to start our own league… The Community Spotlight is an ongoing series showcasing the coolest, most unique communities on Discord. If you run a great community or know someone who does, we’d love to speak with them. Reach out to the blog team using our submission form and we’ll be in touch.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "discord welcomes tesa aragones as new cmo", "author": ["Jason Citron"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/discord-welcomes-tesa-aragones-as-new-cmo-efe8104ce507", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com We’re thrilled to announce that Tesa Aragones has joined Discord as Chief Marketing Officer where she’ll oversee brand, consumer, and product marketing functions as Discord broadens to welcome a variety of new users. Before joining our team Tesa was the CMO at VSCO. She is an award-winning digital and brand marketing executive who brings more than 25 years of experience managing global brands including Nike and Volkswagen. She is the original creator of Nike Training Club, one of Nike’s most popular digital communities! Tesa, a Detroit-native, is a recipient of Ad Age’s 40 Marketers Under 40, a member of the Advisory Council for the Cranbrook Academy of Art since 2011, an official judge at the Cannes Festival of Creativity Future Lions, a member of the Forbes Communications Council, and an inventor on 12 patents filed by Nike. I sat down with her to hear a bit more about her initial thoughts about Discord — check it out! First of all, thanks Jason. I’m super excited to be joining you and the Discord team on this journey. Really looking forward to getting started. But as far as my background, I am first-generation Filipino and I grew up in Detroit. These data points are important for me to mention because my parents were immigrants which is why I’m particularly grateful for the opportunities and successes that I have had during my career. And, as a woman and a person of color, “where I come from” defines a lot about how I move through life. Growing up in Detroit instilled in me an appreciation and real passion for innovation, creativity, and a whole lot of hustle. As for my career, I’ve been fortunate to have worked for some of the most iconic brands on some incredible projects. I’ve also split my career on the agency and client-side of the business which has taught me the fundamentals of marketing, digital innovation, and the creative process. I’ve come to realize that the work I’m most proud of works in more than one way–it has to solve a consumer’s need, move the world forward, and inspire with a great story. Projects at Nike, Volkswagen, Apple, Xbox, and VSCO were some of my favorites. I have used Discord for some time now. I was originally introduced to it by my nephew Izaak who, since he was very young, has played video games online. Izaak is in college now, and Discord has become his primary form of communication with his friends — and with me. But it was not until earlier this year when I started to appreciate Discord for its ability to connect people and serve communities. Over the past several months, the feelings of fear and isolation arising from the global pandemic and quarantine have become part of our daily lives. For someone used to commuting to an office, working alongside my teams, and collaborating with partners, these dramatic lifestyle shifts have been jarring and, more than anything, isolating. As I’m sure many of us do, I miss the sense of connection that these communities give me. I began to wonder, “Where do I belong?” With the global events of 2020, I realized I needed to expand my definition of the word, “belonging”, beyond simply “an affinity for a place or situation”. In previous roles, I’ve focused on a powerful, but narrow, expression of community. At Nike, I created a digital training community through Nike Training Club. At VSCO, I fostered a digital creative community. I’m proud of these accomplishments and the impact of these communities. But 2020 has helped me understand the even greater potential in digital communities to find purpose and belonging. That is why it was so inspiring and refreshing to meet you and learn that Discord exists to give everyone the power to create belonging in their life . The feeling of “belonging” is a universal human need. And now more than ever, people are looking for ways to stay connected. I believe that there is so much opportunity for Discord as a brand because the service serves this very specific need for all kinds of communities. Tapping into these insights will be exciting. I used to love the athlete storytelling that we did at Nike, especially around the Olympics for the same reason. The best product innovation and brand storytelling are almost always inspired by the people and communities that we serve. I am most excited to help grow the Discord brand and work alongside the talented Discord team. To say that I want to help the Discord brand reach its full potential might sound funny given that Discord just became the #1 social network in the app store, but I love the strategic challenges and work involved in building brands and bringing them to life with the art, science, and emotion of marketing. If you had to describe Discord’s brand in 5 words, what would you choose? Playful Innovative Inclusive Purposeful Fun Tell us about what you meant when you said that companies should “ obsess the consumer journey ”? I have a very consumer-centric approach to marketing and innovation. I believe in putting the consumer in the center of everything a brand does and then designing experiences that serve customers along their journey. In practical terms, this often means mapping out the consumer journey and establishing an emotional connection at every touchpoint with the brand. It’s never enough to only think about the end goal or KPI. A deep understanding of your consumer at every point along their journey enables brands to make each interaction more meaningful and relevant. Building iconic brands is a full-funnel discipline and craft. Brands that only focus on lower-funnel metrics often lose brand affinity over time. Brands that obsess about the consumer journey have real potential to become global icons.

She most recently served as Head of Engineering for LinkedIn’s Feed, where she led the R&D teams for the feed, sharing, and homepage teams. She is an active supporter of diversity in STEM, co-founded LinkedIn’s Women in Technology initiative, and an alumnus board member of Women’s Audio Mission . She was named one of the most powerful female engineers by Business Insider in 2018. I sat down with her to hear a bit more about her initial thoughts about Discord. If we want to start from the very beginning, I grew up in India and ended up getting my Master’s degree in computer applications from Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya in Indore. I spent most of my early career building data infrastructure solutions before moving to the Bay Area in 2007 to join Garmin and work on their fitness devices for a couple of years. After about two years at Garmin, I began my decade-long career at Linkedin. I started as a software engineer and grew to lead the engineering teams in charge of LinkedIn’s homepage, feed, ad serving, sharing, and follow ecosystems. I’ve loved my time at LinkedIn and learned a huge amount there — I’m excited to bring that experience to Discord now. What drew me to Discord was the team’s dedication to bringing people together to talk, which resonates with my personal passion. I was also attracted to the fantastic confluence of people and products that Jason and Stan have built in only 5 years. Today, Discord’s purpose of giving everyone the power to create belonging in their life is more meaningful than ever. Finding alternatives for having meaningful conversations with friends, meeting people with shared interests, and generally staying in touch with those who matter to us is increasingly more relevant in today’s world. Discord is embracing its ambition to be the place for communities of all shapes and sizes. It’s both inspiring and exhilarating, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of realizing this purpose. Some of the projects I’m looking forward to taking on are bringing in entry-level talent, furthering our commitment to diversity, and scaling the team and processes to support future growth. There are already 100 million users every month who love Discord partly because of how reliable our tech is. We want to grow Discord in a way that’s inclusive of all our new users but also continue to invest in reliability and performance as our top priority. I’m excited to build the right team to do that. The company culture is phenomenal and has made onboarding extremely smooth. Everybody I’ve met at Discord is excited to be here and very approachable. The ubiquitous focus on Discord’s mission and strong desire to see it succeed is so contagious, I think I might bleed blurple already! Discord’s way of working lends itself really well to the remote work environment we are all in right now — it’s hard to believe Discord wasn’t built as a remote company! Our day to day work is carried out almost exclusively on Discord itself. The various text and voice channels keep our work organized, and everyone in the company is accessible practically instantaneously. It’s a great way to get to know the product inside out! Starting a new job during a global pandemic doesn’t seem like the best idea, but Discord has made it smoother than expected. I am grateful for the support we receive for ergonomic home office setups and the generous desk funds. New employee integration is very thoughtful and really geared to infusing everyone with the culture and values everyone shares at Discord. I’ve felt welcome and instantly at home with my new work family. I am passionate about creating teams that build delightful products together — teams where each employee’s experience motivates and inspires them. I want the time they spend on my teams to be the best experience in their careers. I truly believe that can only be the case if there is a real diversity of thought, perspective, and experience on teams — that’s the only way to have strong and creative teams. So I always look for ways to identify and support diverse talent. I look forward to partnering closely with my colleagues, and the various teams across Discord to continue making it an inclusive, diverse, and nurturing place for all employees. Many of Discord’s hiring practices reflect these principles, but I’m excited to help strengthen them starting at the entry- and internship levels, and help the company develop career re-entry programs. This is certainly a topic that’s close to my heart. In some ways, I believe I’ve benefitted from growing up and starting my career outside of the U.S. While I haven’t experienced it directly, the disparity in career outcomes based on race and gender in the tech industry might be more pronounced in the U.S. as compared to the rest of the world. For most of my early career, I was usually the only female engineer in the room. However, I didn’t feel my opportunities were any different or more constrained than my peers. In fact, I worked part-time for a startup while studying for my Master’s degree and by the time I graduated, I was leading teams of more experienced engineers. When I think about supporting women and people of color in technology I think of it as replicating that experience. It starts all the way from introducing someone to technology and doing it in a way that makes it accessible and achievable for them. Then progresses to giving them opportunities to compete and learn, and finally finding them a place in the industry that can challenge and support them. I’m proud to support programs and organizations that work along this spectrum like WAM (Women’s Audio Mission) , that introduces young girls from underserved communities to science through music production, along with Technovation Girls , who work to bring together girls from high schools and teach them how to code, build an app and compete with peers, and the State Department’s TechWomen program that pairs international leaders with mentors to help boost their careers. I personally believe that now is the best time for the tech industry to come together and find solutions that will lead us to a future where gender and racial parity will become the norm. As an industry, we need to do more than just shifting the pie distribution and invest in growing the pie itself.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "discord is for your communities", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/discord-is-for-your-communities-3d14464d4c7b", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Five years ago, we started Discord as a better way for you and your friends to talk while playing games together. At the time, we assumed that most servers would be a small handful of mutual friends who already knew each other. This turned out to be mostly true — the majority of servers on Discord today are smaller servers with close friends. What we didn’t predict was how creative our users could be! Many of you started using Discord for something bigger: building communities where hundreds to thousands of like-minded people can come together to talk, make friends, and deepen their passion. Today, there are millions of communities thriving on Discord where tens of millions of people talk. We’ve seen so many creative communities from Animal Crossing servers where people post their turnip prices in real-time to educational servers where members learn new languages directly from native speakers over text and voice. Every day we see more communities coming to Discord: servers about Harry Potter, the Cosmere, hip-hop, sneakers, programming, My Hero Academia, Taylor Swift, and more. It’s been a thrill watching you all build. The servers you’ve created have become places that many call their second home: places where they can meet new friends and not feel alone in the world. Places where they can be themselves amongst people they trust. In the beginning, we couldn’t have imagined Discord being used this way, but now, it’s impossible to imagine Discord without the communities you’ve fostered. This world exists because of you , the admins and moderators of these Discord communities around the globe. You’ve shown us that Discord can do much more than help stay in touch with friends — it can be used to find new ones, and give people the power to create their own belonging. We know building a community on Discord hasn’t been easy. Originally our product wasn’t set up to serve your needs out of the box, so you’ve had to come up with original — but time-consuming — ways to make Discord work for your community and your members. We want to change that. We want to be your partners and help you build and manage your community. We want to make it easier for you to run successful servers, letting you spend more time connecting with and building your community. As we go forward, we want to work with you every step of the way. Let’s make this clear: communities are an essential part of Discord, and we’re making it a core responsibility for us to serve communities and create first-class experiences for both admins and members. Since the start of the year, we’ve dedicated resources across product, engineering, marketing, operations, and Trust & Safety to make Discord better for communities. We’ve been learning from you and studying the following: How can we make it easier to start new communities on Discord? How can we make it easier to moderate communities sustainably on Discord? How can we make it easier to participate in communities on Discord? How can we make it easier to find and join new communities on Discord? Today, we’re excited to share our first step into this better world: if you run a community , you can now designate your server as a “Community Server” inside Server Settings. This enables our team to build and release new features that are custom-tailored for communities, and a number of them are ready today, including the following: Welcome Screen : Set up a personalized welcome screen for new visitors of your server so they know what your community is about and where to start. This way, they can immediately head to the welcome and rules channels instead of wandering around lost. Announcement Channels : These are special channels that enable you to broadcast messages beyond your server. Users can “Follow” your announcement channels and receive those updates directly to their own servers. Discovery : You can display your community directly on Discord’s Server Discovery — no more having to advertise somewhere else to attract new users! At launch, this will be limited to servers with more than 10,000 members, Partnered & Verified servers. We will lower these limits over time. Direct Community Updates from Discord : New features and changes from Discord can significantly impact your server. To help keep up to date, you can now select a moderator-only channel for official Discord updates. We’ll give you that heads up so you and your moderation team will always be prepared. Server Insights : Server Insights provides information about your server that can let you know how your community is doing and help you make informed decisions to improve it. How many members joined last week? How many of them have talked? How many left? At launch, Server Insights will be limited to only servers with more than 500 members, Partnered & Verified servers. We will work on reducing this requirement in the future. Head on over to the Community tab in your Server Settings to learn more about all of these features, and stay tuned for more to come over the next few months. For the best servers with active and engaged communities, we’re excited to share that the Partner Program will be officially reopening in the summer. We know many of you have been waiting for a long time, and we’re stoked to finally be able to pull the curtain on what we’ve been working on! We’ve spent the last year reviewing what exactly makes the Discord Partner Program so special and reworked it from the ground up. We know that many of you spend a ton of time creating fantastic places for your members to hang out, and you deserve to be recognized for that work. We’ll be releasing another blog with specific details next week. So stay tuned! In addition to new features and tools directly in Discord, we also want to roll out specialized resources to moderators who are directly building out these communities and shepherding their growth, day after day. We’re currently designing a curriculum for mods that starts at the Discord basics, such as how to make decisions, resolve conflicts, and protect your server. More experienced moderators will find something new to learn, with deeper discussions such as policy-crafting and community governance structures. We’re calling this the Discord Mod Academy, and as part of it, we will also be launching a Discord server where server moderators can connect with each other to get moderation advice, feedback, and any additional help you may need. We’ll have more to share this fall. We want Discord to be the best home for your community. Though building communities can be difficult, we’re here to support you, whether you’re a first-time server creator or someone who’s been fostering a community of 250 or 250,000. In a year from now, if someone wants to start a community dedicated to falconry, ultrarunning, a brand new VR game, or the hottest TV show, we want to make sure that we’ve built the tools to make it easy and given them the knowledge to turn it into a thriving community. We know we’ve got a long journey ahead, and we couldn’t be more excited to partner with you. Be sure to send us an invite to your future falconry server, too! All of this is just the beginning, and we can’t wait to see what’s next. Imagine a Place 1.6K 26 Product 1.6K claps 1.6K 26 Written by Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses.

Since then, we’ve gotten daily questions asking “When’s the Partner Program opening up?,” or “How can I get my server Verified?” Rather than quickly opening up the programs in the same state they were in before, we spent the last few months taking a step back and rethinking the program. We asked ourselves: What truly makes a Discord Partner? What does it mean to be Verified on Discord, and how can we improve both programs without losing focus on what makes them important? Multiple teams within the company got together to understand what makes great communities on Discord and how that should be reflected in the Server Verification & Partner Programs. Some of the solutions we came up with have been shared in our recent Community blog, including Welcome Channels and Server Insights. For the best of the best, we’d like to introduce the revamped Partner & Verified Server Programs: We believe Partnered servers should be welcoming for both newcomers to Discord and longtime users. Whether you’re a content creator connecting with your followers, owner of a large cooking server, or if one day you decided to start a group dedicated to birdwatching that happened to grow like crazy, building a successful community isn’t easy. But if you’ve managed to overcome those challenges and fostered a great place to talk, you should be rewarded for it. With newly-released tools like Server Insights we are now able to provide tangible goals for Partnered servers. It’s now finally possible to get an objective look at how your community is performing at any time, and how your server compares to what we look for in the Partner Program. Starting today, we’re shifting our Partnership Program to reward active and engaged servers with recognition and extra tools to help them invest in their communities. This means that Partner requirements will now focus on the success of your Discord server rather than your performance on other platforms. How do you get to the Partner application? In order to apply for the Partner Program, you’ll have to mark yourself as a “Community” in Server Settings. This will allow you to access Server Insights, which includes a new Partner Program section dedicated to letting you track your progress towards applying for Partnership. Once your community reaches our engagement requirements, you’ll be able to apply directly within your Discord server when we reopen applications in the summer — no need to open an external website to submit an app for Partnership. If you’d like to see what we look for in Partnered servers to prepare for when applications open, check out the Discord Partnership Requirements help article . The Verified Server Program started as a way for game developers to distinguish themselves from community-run servers to let the world know they’re in the official home for their game. Over the years, companies outside of just gaming have expressed interest in a Verified Discord server. However, our existing gaming-focused Verification requirements were holding us back from expanding further. We want to continue supporting Discord as a platform where anyone can talk, no matter what your interest may be. Because of this, we’re expanding the Verification Program to include businesses, brands, and figures of public interest . If you’re the official server for your company, organization, or public figure with a massive following (we’re talkin’ way massive) you can qualify for Verification. Along with a snazzy “Verified” badge next to the server’s name, servers accepted will receive access to a Vanity URL and custom invite splash art to help spread awareness. There’ll still be a few prerequisites to hit, so not everyone will get Verification for just being a “company.” We’re super excited to finally be able to open the program up to include more from all our friends outside of gaming. Check out our Verified Server requirements for the full scoop. Previously, we considered the Partner & Verified servers to be independent of one another. This would mean if you were a Partner, you couldn’t be Verified and vice versa. The Partner Program is considered to be the “best of the best,” but this restriction meant that Verified servers who were fostering amazing communities couldn’t be recognized for their work. Starting soon, that’s changing. If you are a Verified server, you can apply for Partnership and be part of both programs . The Partner Program is designed to reward active and engaged communities, and if your Verified Server is fostering a great community, you can now be properly rewarded for it. Acceptance for Server Verification grants your server access to the following perks : A Vanity URL Invite splash backgrounds The Verified Server badge Acceptance for the Discord Partner Program includes both the Vanity URL and invite splash, along with additional perks, including : A Server Banner displayed at the top of your server’s channel list. An animated Server Icon A Discord Partner badge on both the server and you, the server owner. Access to Discord Nitro for the server owner, on the house. Since both programs offer a Vanity URL and invite splash images, if you are a Verified Server that joins, then leaves, the Partner Program, you will retain that same Vanity URL and invite splash throughout moving between programs. We’re planning to open up Verification & Partner applications this summer. Our Verification & Partnership requirements have been updated with what you’ll need to apply to each program. Take a look at both and make any preparations before applying: Partner Program Requirements Verified Server Requirements Partners Vs Verification We’ve been eagerly waiting for the day when we can finally start accepting applications again.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "discord transparency report jan june 2020", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/discord-transparency-report-jan-june-2020-2ef4a3ee346d", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Note: The graph relating to “Proactive removals” was updated in April 2021. The proactive server deletions were initially overreported. Corrected totals are provided in the new graphic. A lot has happened on Discord since our last transparency report. We’d like to spend some time catching you up on the biggest changes and how we’ve responded to them. In May, we refreshed our Community Guidelines . This new document clarifies the kind of behavior and content that is — and isn’t — allowed on Discord. It clarifies some of our existing policies so that they more clearly reflect what we stand for. We wanted it to sum up all the values we hold near and dear: treating each other with respect, treating your communities with respect, and keeping Discord a safe and friendly place for everyone. Later in June, we rolled out our new Safety Center . This is a great resource for everyone, with tips on how to keep your account safe, articles explaining Discord for parents and educators, and a clear breakdown of how we enforce our policies. In the future, we plan to add more how-to articles to address common issues and resolutions to them. We’re also looking to add more case studies, policy documentation, and resources on community moderation. Finally, the biggest change since our last transparency report has been COVID-19 and the growth it has created for our service. With more people staying home, many new people joined Discord to talk to their friends and seek out communities. In June we announced that Discord has grown to more than 100 million monthly active users . As you might expect, as we welcomed more and more people to Discord, there was a concomitant rise in reports created. This graph shows the month-over-month increase in reports received by Trust & Safety in the first half of 2020. The reports we received almost doubled in the last few months. As Discord grows, one of our top priorities is to help everyone continue to have a safe experience. For that reason, the number of employees on our Trust & Safety team almost doubled in the last six months, continuing as one of the biggest teams in the company. We’re working hard to make sure that anyone at any time can write in, have their issue looked at, and get the help they need. In keeping with our previous reports , we’ll detail the breakdown of reports by category, the rates at which we action violations of our Terms or Guidelines, the total number of actions taken by Trust & Safety, and the rate at which we restore accounts. One of the new things we want to spend some time on in this report is user warnings and their effectiveness. Warnings are useful in situations not involving a serious threat of harm because they present an opportunity for user education without us taking permanent action on an account. They’re a good step towards increasing the variety of tools in our toolset, and as Discord continues to grow, we’ll continue to explore new ways of tackling abuse. We want to make each new transparency report more useful and accessible than the last, so we’ve updated how we’re presenting information this time around. The first is the category breakdown: We’ve standardized the way we categorize violations. In each graph, you can expect to see the same 11 categories. Broadly speaking, these are representative of all the different kinds of reports that come in to Trust & Safety, and we feel they paint a clear picture of the behavior and content we’re working to keep off Discord. To that end, we may update our categories in future reports to better reflect what we see and what users report to us. For this report, we’ve introduced a new category: cybercrime. Cybercrime covers social engineering, fraud, scams, and things like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Our previous hacks and cheats category is now exclusive to malicious behavior in online games, such as account cracking and distribution of cheats. Looking back at the second half of 2019, Trust & Safety received about 128,000 user reports. In the first six months of 2020, we’ve shot way past that number, up to roughly 235,000 reports , driven by the number of people on the platform and the increased time people spent on Discord during the pandemic. Here’s the breakdown of violations by category: This is inbound. These aren’t confirmed instances of bad behavior or objectionable content on Discord, but rather all the reports we received and investigated. Next is a graph that shows the action rate of reports by category: As you can see, there’s a correlation between ease of verification and the actionability of abuse. Spamming on Discord most often looks like unsolicited direct messages telling a user to join a server or asking them to add a bot to a server — free Nitro bots and cryptocurrency scams have been most common in the last six months — and have a high actionability rate. Exploitative content and doxxing reports are also up there. With those categories, it’s often immediately obvious when a violation has occurred, and identifying motives is relatively straightforward. On the other side of the actionability scale is harassment. Harassment is the largest category of reports received but actually ends up being the least actionable category. This should also make sense as unlike doxxing, for example, there’s a variance in what individuals consider harassing behavior. We get some reports of malicious ban evading and flooding of friend requests, which generally are actionable, but a lot more of someone calling someone else names, or even filing a report under harassment and simply stating that they don’t like the other person or what they say, which is not actionable by Trust & Safety and is more appropriately addressed by the complainant blocking a user they don’t like. In addition to getting more reports than ever before, we’re also taking more action than before. Let’s look at the accounts deleted for violating our Terms or Guidelines: This chart represents the total user bans in the first half of 2020. This chart isn’t very helpful in understanding anything except that there’s a lot of spam: in the first half of 2020, we banned 4,083,444 accounts for spam. Here’s a more helpful chart that excludes spam: Raiding may stand out as being somewhat high, but there’s a reason for this. While most other reports are about individual activity, raiding is generally coordinated activity by a group. When users decide to raid, they join another server all at once and spam disruptive comments, generally ones that are against the Community Guidelines. When we have confirmed an instance of raiding, we will take action against all the group members who participated. Only 17% of the reports we receive are about raiding, but as you can see, it results in a higher number of bans, because we’ll take action on all the users responsible for the activity. And you’ll see that exploitative content is the reason for the highest number of bans, even though this category only makes up about eight percent of reports received. This is because the majority of exploitative content posted to Discord is deleted proactively, without users having to report the content (we’ll address this later in the report). Harassment, on the other hand, makes up about a third of the reports received but accounts for a smaller fraction of users actioned. Sometimes we’ll see behavior in a report that violates our Terms and Guidelines but isn’t severe enough to warrant permanent account deletion. In these instances, Trust & Safety can issue a warning, which will send a message letting the user know they’ve been warned and which rule they broke. Warnings may also be accompanied by a temporary ban, ranging from one hour to two weeks, proportionate to the severity of the violation of our Community Guidelines. For the first time ever, we’re publishing the total number of warnings given. If you look at this graph next to user deletions, it’s clear that there are fewer warnings than deletions. The logic behind this is that in most cases there’s a clear and deliberate attempt to violate our policies . For example, if a user says “Get doxxed” and posts personally identifiable information that calls for a deletion and not a warning. But we often give users the benefit of the doubt in cases where the intent is not certain. One of the categories we warn for most frequently is NSFW content outside of an NSFW gate. A user with a profile picture with adult content goes against our Community Guidelines because the image can’t be age-gated and is therefore viewable to anyone who connects with the user. Instead of deleting the account though, Trust & Safety will issue a warning, clear the avatar, and allow the user to upload a more appropriate picture. Our numbers show that these actions are effective as a means to course-correct users. The chart below calculates the percentage of warned users who go on to be deleted for the same reason: fewer than three percent of these users go on to have their accounts banned for the same reason. As our platform continues to grow, we believe in using many tools to address abuse, including both user education and other actions. We also understand that not every tool is fit for every situation. In categories such as cybercrime and exploitative content, Trust & Safety rarely issues warnings. With the latter especially, which includes child exploitation, we take a particularly hard stance against those posting the content. In the next section, we’ll say a bit more about our efforts to proactively detect and delete users who post exploitative content. Sometimes, taking action on an individual isn’t enough: when a server’s sole purpose revolves around behavior or content that violates our Terms or Guidelines, we will take action on the entire community. Generally, this will only affect the server itself and the owner and moderators of the server, but in rare cases, it may include all participants. The chart below shows the number of servers removed in the first six months of 2020. Part of our goal in showcasing actions on servers is to illustrate the bigger picture. A keen eye might notice there’s a difference in the charts between users and servers actioned, and that the highest numbers on one are not generally the highest on the other. This is because abuse on Discord comes at different levels, and we address it at both the server and user level. For example, while the number of individuals we delete for hacks and cheats or cybercrime is generally low, the number of servers we remove for the same reason is comparatively high. We ban for these reasons much more often at the server level because these activities are more easily coordinated in servers, and the harm comes from the server existing as a whole. And in other situations, like doxxing, it’s less likely that the doxxing is the result of a server dedicated to it and more likely simply a user, so the ratio is closer. Finally, in cases of exploitative content — again, this is non-consensual pornography and child exploitation — we action all accounts in the server, so the ratio is the other way around. As an earlier blog post by our co-founders notes, we are deeply committed to racial equality . Part of that for us means making sure racist and extremist groups stay off Discord. As the Black Lives Matter protests swept through the country, Trust & Safety ramped up efforts to ban groups seeking to interfere with the peaceful protests. We’re very proud to have shut down some of the worst-of-the-worst organizing groups before they could cause harm. In terms of hard numbers, as the first half of 2020 got underway, the ratio of proactive to reactive extremist servers removed climbed as high as 5:1. Alongside these efforts, we continued to remove all exploitative content. This category groups together child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual pornography. As noted in our last transparency report, when child-harm material is uploaded to Discord, we quickly report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and action the account sharing it. We have a similar zero-tolerance attitude towards nonconsensual images on Discord: these servers are removed, in most cases without users having to stumble into them. In the graph below, we’ve totaled the number of extremist and exploitative server deletions for the first six months of 2020. These volumes show a slight uptick from our proactive deletions in 2019. As we move into the second half of 2020, we will continue to monitor and deplatform extremist groups organizing on Discord as well as any users sharing exploitative content. A major success we had in the first half of 2020 was the complete dismantling of a network of servers sharing nonconsensual pornography. Our proactive team identified an entire network of 700 servers and systematically removed the content and communities involved. When those users attempted to return to Discord, they were again identified and removed. Nonconsensual pornography has no place on our platform, and we’ll continue to take swift action against these communities and their members. One final note on our recent events: as the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world, the Trust & Safety team spun up a taskforce to investigate potential servers spreading dangerous misinformation about health and disease. Across our efforts, we found that there was no significant degree of misinformation on Discord, and instead that Discord was being used as hoped — to help build communities that support and encourage others while we face this unprecedented global challenge. In the future, we will continue to deploy strike teams to target other areas where we see the possibility of misinformation that has a high chance of resulting in real-world harm. The final piece we will cover is account restorations. Anyone who has been permanently banned for violating our Terms or Guidelines is welcome to write to Trust & Safety and have their ban reviewed. The chart below displays the rate at which we unban accounts by category. For context, in terms of aggregate numbers, in 2020 (and setting aside spam ): We banned 252,768 accounts. On those accounts, we received 70,349 appeals. On those appeals, we reversed our action and unbanned 3,035 accounts. Overall, the rate of reversal was about 1.2%. For spam, we took action on just over 4 million accounts, received 45,046 appeals, and unbanned about 18,000 accounts, which results in a reversal rate of 0.44%. The “Other” category may stand out as being quite high, but it represents one of the smallest volume of unbans: only 289 user restorations in the entire first half of 2020. We will consider lifting an account ban under a few circumstances: First, if a mistake has been made when originally actioning the account. While we investigate every situation thoroughly, we are human, there are tens of thousands of reports and many of them require urgent attention, and so mistakes may happen. Second, if the appeal reveals information or context that substantially changes our understanding of the situation. Third, if the activity that led to the ban is low-harm, the potential for a repeat offense appears to be low, and the user takes responsibility for their actions. The third situation is the most likely and leads to the overwhelming majority of our unbans. It is generally our belief that most individuals deserve second chances for their actions, and if they understand their actions and pledge to do better, we believe they should have another chance. The last six months were a whirlwind for both the company and Trust & Safety. Our top priority has been making sure Trust & Safety scales with the needs of users and can continue to keep everyone safe on Discord. We received almost double as many reports in June as we did in January, and we’ve been working across the board on internal tools, machine learning, and hiring and onboarding new Trust & Safety employees in order to make sure we are able to keep up with all the new Discord users. We’re proud of where we stand today, but we also know there is more work to be done. We’re diving into the second half of the year with a number of projects that will make Discord safer still. Some of those will operate behind the scenes and reduce spam, some of them will make user reporting easier, and others are targeted at helping out our moderators. We look forward to sharing more with you in blogs over the next few months. Finally, we plan to publish these reports every six months. The rest of this year will be covered in our next report in January 2021. With every transparency report, we seek to provide more information (like our breakout of warnings that we featured this time) and continue to make them accessible and interesting. Thanks for making Discord your place to talk — we’re excited to continue the conversation with you.

We’ll be regularly highlighting servers that are doing something distinctly different, special, or just plain cool. For our first feature, we’d like to share with the world the UT Dallas Discord , a community-led by Eric Aaberg that acts as a student hub for The University of Texas at Dallas. The server originally started out solely focused on being a server for Eric’s graduating class of 2022. He was but a wee incoming freshman, wanting to establish an easy way for him to connect and bond with his fellow Comets in his graduating year (Comets are what they call themselves at UT Dallas!). Soon after starting the server, the UT Dallas Discord ran its first-ever community meetup in Fall 2018. Around 20 people showed up, and some of them soon became Eric’s closest friends. A few even became part of the ever-growing student moderator team in the UT Dallas Discord. Over time, the server gained considerably more traction than he first expected. Once realizing this, Eric pivoted the server to become the “UT Dallas Discord,” encompassing the entire university rather than just his specific graduating class. Since then, it’s become the home for students being able to talk and connect with each other ever since. “What is really unique about our server is that it doesn’t only provide a space for students to connect with other students, but also to connect with the 350+ student organizations, clubs, programs, and university departments on it as well!” Eric explains, “We have tons of student leaders on our Discord who have a special role/badge which exclusively allows them to even send out announcements.” The UT Dallas Discord even has a custom Discord bot called Temoc, named after their university mascot, which greets new users and is always ready to celebrate by typing in !whoosh, !dance, or !highfive. We don’t need to explain by now, but 2020 has been drastically different for all of us. To help ease the students of UT Dallas into the new mix of online and offline learning, channels within the Discord are categorized into 4 distinct categories: Resource Channels , such as the good ol’ rules, adding roles, and even a directory of sub-server communities within UT Dallas. Announcement channels, which include both server-based and university-based announcements. Discussion channels , where the main bulk of the conversation happens. Subjects include general chat, academics, art, memes, a student bulletin board, and even a lost and found for when you find yet another earbud abandoned in the campus hallways. Subscription channels , opt-in news feeds for graduating classes, and alumni to be directly notified on the latest campus happenings. Keeping everything laid out nice and neat keeps new and returning students in the know about what’s goin’ on around UT Dallas — something even more important when you aren’t heading to campus as much as you used to, if at all. “With the transition of a majority of activities & academics going virtual, our Discord server plays an even bigger part of connecting the Comet Community together. We’re focusing a lot on helping out with weekly campus events and increasing our moderation team to help transition new users onto the Discord. We’re even hosting an educational event targeting student groups on campus, explaining why they should engage in the UT Dallas Discord, sharing how they can host events in our community, and even why they could consider making their own sub-Discord server for their niche community.” It might seem daunting to establish a server as big as UT Dallas Discord, but Eric has some sage advice for those pondering the idea of starting a campus community Discord: “ Do it, do it, do it! ” “Discord has grown to become a very popular and known platform for college students and is a perfect way to build a community. From the ability to use Discord on mobile and desktop devices, to the super quick loading speeds, I use Discord for all of my primary communication.” And most important of all: you get to spread the news of your on-campus ice cream meetups with all your fellow students. 🍦 (Vanilla, please.) If you happen to be a prospective student, needing tips for college or are scoping out the University of Texas at Dallas as a place you’d like to attend your future classes, feel free to join the community at discord.gg/utdallas . !highfive. The Community Spotlight is an ongoing series showcasing the coolest, most unique communities on Discord. If you run a great community or know someone who does, we’d love to speak with them.

But you don’t wanna stop talking with your friends, so you join voice on mobile. Sounds simple enough. But your neighbor’s mowing the lawn. And there are 30mph winds blowing into your phone’s mic. And 5 car horns start going off simultaneously. You’re forced to put yourself on mute, and you now regret your outdoor endeavor. You promise to catch up later. Voice chat is a staple of Discord, and as your place to talk, we want to make it easy for you to bring Discord wherever you go. It’s not always possible to control the noise around you, and we’re doing all we can so you can have great conversions in any environment on any device. Back in April, we introduced noise suppression to all Discord desktop users via our partnership with Krisp.ai. Today, we’re rolling out Krisp noise suppression on Discord mobile across both iOS and Android! We’re one of the first mobile voice chat apps to introduce noise suppression. Krisp helps to make sure you feel like you’re right next to your friends, even in a noisy situation. Take that breezy walk, cook that stir-fry you’ve been hungry for all day, and buy the loudest mechanical keyboard you can find — all without having to worry about background noise. Text chat is great, but there’s nothing quite like hearing the familiar voice of a friend, especially when we feel farther apart than normal. It’s frustrating when unwanted background noises get in the way. Discord is here to support you, your friends, and whatever you want to talk about. As we continue to improve voice chat, Krisp is an integral part of making Discord your place to talk. No matter how stressful the world around us may be, Krisp is here to help every one of our 100 million monthly active users feel more connected to our far-away friends. Krisp uses machine-learning magic to filter out anything that isn’t a human voice. You can microwave your favorite popcorn, let your kid enjoy their harmonica, or give your dog that new squeaky toy you know they deserve. No one on the other end will hear a peep (or squeak). Krisp is already a part of Discord. When connected to a voice channel, just enable the sound wave icon to filter out background noise and voilà. No matter what’s going on around you, your voice will be crisp and clear. You can learn more about how this noise suppression works through our Help Center . We’d love to hear your feedback, so let us know your thoughts on Twitter . We hope that it can help you as you use Discord to stay connected to your communities around the world no matter where you are.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord made android in app navigation easier", "author": ["Donald Chen"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-made-android-in-app-navigation-easier-fbd904d12521", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com When Discord first started as a desktop app, the fastest way to make Discord available on Android and iOS involved copying the desktop app’s existing navigation patterns. Mobile users switched between core features using a navigation drawer which allowed the mobile apps to mostly replicate the desktop app’s UI. While the old navigation UI served early Discord users well, we realized over time that our mobile in-app navigation for accessing core features like the Quick Switcher had become unintuitive and hard to discover for new users. We needed a navigation UI that made primary features easier for new users to discover while making secondary features still available to existing users. To make Discord’s primary features more understandable, we recently launched the new Tabs product in our Android app! We found this project exciting to tackle, because in addition to making the app easier to navigate, this project presented a series of technical challenges that led us to build a custom bottom tabs navigation implementation and a panels-based replacement for Android’s stock navigation drawer. Before we dive into the technical details, let’s review why we built the Tabs product which includes both the bottom tabs and the panels navigation. We built Tabs to improve the Discord mobile experience in three ways: 1) Unlock surface area for future products . We’re currently exploring product ideas, like features to help users discover and join communities of interest, that we’d like to surface in Tabs. While drawers optimized the app for current features, they provided too many constraints for future top level mobile features. 2) Familiar mobile navigation paradigm . Modern Android and iOS apps commonly use bottom tabs navigation to make their core features easy to understand. 3) UX benefits . Conversations in Discord happen in many places, and Tabs helps users navigate to those conversations. With the new horizontal panel gestures in Tabs, users can access servers, channels, and Direct Messages more easily now! Additionally, panel gestures allow users to now peek at new activity in the servers list. Tabs more prominently surfaces powerful features like the Quick Switcher which also helps users get to conversations more quickly. Tabs helps users stay on top of unread mentions and incoming friend requests via notification badges on the Home tab and on the Friends tab. Unlike Android’s standard drawers whose gestures conflict with Android 10’s system back gestures , our mobile apps’ panels are easier to swipe because they support horizontal swipes from most areas on the screen. From a design systems perspective, we wanted the app to have only one primary navigation component: the bottom tabs. Keeping the drawer with bottom tabs violated Material Design guidelines that suggested not using drawers and bottom tabs together . They were both primary navigation components which made the information hierarchy ambiguous when used together. Because the drawers overlaid the channels list on top of the bottom tabs, the drawers didn’t clearly indicate how users should get to the Chat feature from a non-Home tab. By replacing drawers with panels, we repositioned the channels list to make the UI correctly represent the “Home -> Channels -> Chat” hierarchy. With this change, the bottom tabs more clearly represented the primary navigation hierarchy, while the panels represented a secondary navigation hierarchy within the Home tab. When we started building Tabs for Discord Android, we looked forward to trying out Android’s BottomNavigationView along with the AndroidX Navigation component . On paper, both of these frameworks seemed like solutions that would make building Tabs much easier. In reality, we discovered that both of these frameworks had limitations that prevented us from delivering a delightful and responsive UI to our users. For the bottom tabs, we aimed to create a visually delightful experience by showing the user’s avatar and presence indicator for the User Settings tab. This required our bottom tabs to support custom views in addition to standard icons. Right off the bat, BottomNavigationView’s limited API, which used standard icons from an Android menu resource , could not support the complex icon behaviors we hoped to deliver. Although BottomNavigationView supported adding custom child views programmatically , it didn’t offer default APIs for more complex icon behaviors like setting alpha values to indicate selection state (e.g. for the user avatar). It also didn’t automatically support showing the custom child view in Android Studio layout previews which we depended on to help us develop the UI quickly. Instead of using BottomNavigationView , we built a simple custom solution with a horizontal LinearLayout where the child ImageViews and custom views represented each tab. Our custom solution supported complex icon behaviors and Android Studio layout previews. For tabs navigation, we initially tried out the AndroidX Navigation component because we liked the simplicity of its Navigator and Navigation Graph APIs. Unfortunately, when we started building tabs navigation, the AndroidX Navigation component had a major limitation: because the default Navigation component created a new fragment on each tab selection, navigating between tabs felt slow. In order to make tab selection fast, we searched for ways to keep fragments in memory (e.g. creating a custom Navigator component and using the Android Architecture Component sample extension methods ), but ultimately we couldn’t find a satisfactory solution. The custom Navigator component required too much risk for us because the proposed solutions involved completely overriding the parent method, FragmentNavigator#navigate() , without ever calling the super method. That meant that updates to FragmentNavigator and other parts of the Navigation component could easily break our implementation. For the second solution, the sample extension methods applied specifically to Android’s BottomNavigationView , and the methods managed the lifecycle of the tab fragments. Because we had to use a custom view for our bottom tabs, reusing the logic in those extension methods would’ve required writing a custom solution anyway. Since neither of the two solutions above made building responsive tab selection easier, we decided to go with a simple custom tabs solution without using the Navigation component: keeping all fragment tabs in memory inside a host fragment. To enable fast tab selection, we simply toggled the visibility of the tab fragments without needing to create a new fragment each time a user selected a tab. To help us avoid wasting network requests, we made each tab fragment aware of the tab selection state. The Recent Mentions tab, for example, uses this state to only fetch mentions from the network when it is the selected tab. In an early iteration of Discord Tabs, we tried combining the drawers UI and bottom tabs UI together. We knew we couldn’t ship tabs with drawers because it created two simultaneous primary navigation components, but we appreciated DrawerLayout’s default animations and ease-of-use. To replace DrawerLayout , we aimed to build a custom view called OverlappingPanelsLayout with equally polished animations and easy-to-use APIs. We initially experimented with physics-based fling animations. Although they supported fast animations for high-velocity gestures, they made the animations slow for the average low-velocity fling gesture. We couldn’t increase the minimum fling velocity because it would have made the panels too hard to open. Instead of using the physics-based animations, we eventually decided to adopt the easing interpolators and fixed durations recommended by Material Design guidelines . Following these guidelines made opening and closing panels feel responsive and fast. To make the OverlappingPanelsLayout API easy to use, we made the custom view a FrameLayout that expected exactly three child views. The child views represented the left, center, and right panels. In our code, we provided the child views by nesting them in OverlappingPanelsLayout via XML. In addition to supporting polished animations and easy-to-use APIs, building a custom view allowed us to create flexible click handling and swipe handling. Unlike DrawerLayout which only supported drag-open gestures from the edge of the screen, OverlappingPanelsLayout offered multiple gestures to easily open side panels: horizontal swipes on most areas of the screen and also clicks on the closed center panel. With its features and flexible APIs, OverlappingPanelsLayout evolved into an excellent replacement for DrawerLayout . Before we reached that end state, however, we had to first overcome numerous technical challenges like building custom panel gesture detection, allowing horizontal scrolls in child views, and maintaining panel states through device rotations. Building Custom Panel Gesture Detection First, we tried to support dragging the center panel. This Stack Overflow post gave us a sense of how to move the center panel in response to drag gestures. However, copying that code into the onTouchEvent method of OverlappingPanelsLayout didn’t work initially. The child views of OverlappingPanelsLayout handled their own touch events like clicks and vertical scrolls, so the OverlappingPanelsLayout ViewGroup did not initially handle those touch events. Fortunately, Google searches led us to the Android developer documentation for managing touch events in ViewGroups . Based on the lessons from those Android developer docs, we decided to handle fling and drag gestures in OverlappingPanelsLayout using Android’s onInterceptTouchEvent and onTouchEvent APIs. onInterceptTouchEvent decides when the OverlappingPanelsLayout ViewGroup should handle the touch event versus when it should allow child views to handle touch events. OverlappingPanelsLayout handles most horizontal scrolls while allowing its child views to handle vertical scrolls (e.g. for vertically scrolling the chat list or the channels list). This example code from our OverlappingPanelsLayout class demonstrates how we detect dragging and flinging . First, we detect horizontal scrolls by checking that the difference between x values is greater than the distance between y values. Then we intercept those horizontal scroll MotionEvent s, so onTouchEvent can handle them. onTouchEvent handles ACTION_MOVE events by dragging the panel, and it handles ACTION_UP events by snapping the center panel to a closed or opened state. Using the gesture velocity measured by the VelocityTracker , snapOpenOrClose either snaps the center panel to the nearest edge for slow gestures or flings the center panel in the direction of the gesture if the velocity exceeds the minimum fling velocity. Allowing Horizontal Scrolls in Child Views Before we launched the bottom tabs and panels UI to the public, we asked members of the Discord Testers server to help us catch bugs. Discord Testers quickly identified a bug where users could no longer horizontally scroll the emoji category selector in the chat input with the panels UI. We wanted the panels to continue to handle all horizontal swipe gestures as a default behavior. Therefore our bug fix for the emoji category selector bug had to involve a new API that would allow the app to selectively register child gesture regions where the panels should not handle swipes. To disable panel gestures on selected child views, we created a class called PanelsChildGestureRegionObserver which helped detect child gesture regions and notify OverlappingPanelsLayout about those gesture regions. In this example code for registering child gesture regions , ChatInputFragment is a child of OverlappingPanelsLayout . The parent fragment containing OverlappingPanelsLayout , PanelsFragment , listens to the gesture region updates and passes the updates on to OverlappingPanelsLayout via setChildGestureRegions . OverlappingPanelsLayout then knows to not handle horizontal scrolls in those regions. By keeping OverlappingPanelsLayout unaware of which features have child gesture regions, this API makes it easy to disable panel gestures on multiple child views including other use cases like Discord’s push-to-talk button in the center panel which requires holding down the button without shifting the panel. Maintaining Panel States Through Device Rotations Like other modern Android apps, Discord’s Android app aims to maintain view state through device rotations. We initially thought the AndroidX ViewModel architecture component would fully solve the problem of maintaining panel states through rotations. When the OverlappingPanelsLayout view’s parent fragment resumed after a device rotation, the fragment retrieved the pre-rotation panel state from its corresponding view model and tried to update the state on the recreated OverlappingPanelsLayout view. Unfortunately, this initially simple solution caused the app to crash after device rotations. The view model correctly stored state through device rotations, but our app tried to apply the state update to OverlappingPanelsLayout too early. We found that when the fragment tried to apply this update after the rotation, the child view, OverlappingPanelsLayout , had not finished its layout pass in the view drawing process yet. OverlappingPanelsLayout assigned its panel references from the child views inside onLayout , so it couldn’t apply panel state changes until after onLayout . To address the constraint posed by the layout pass occurring after the panel state update, we captured the pre-layout update as a Kotlin lambda called pendingUpdate . We then invoked the pendingUpdate inside onLayout after setting the child panel references. We considered creating a queue of pending updates. However, we realized only the latest state update mattered in our panels use case, so we stuck with the simple solution of saving a single pending update rather than a queue of updates. We’ve shared example code for applying pending view updates here. As more app developers update drawer-navigation-based apps to deal with Android 10’s conflicting system back gesture navigation, we hope Discord’s lessons from building bottom tabs and panels will help you all create delightful and easy-to-navigate UI! We open sourced our panels library in our new Overlapping Panels GitHub repository , and we included a sample app to help you get started.

They have the power to bring together people, from different walks of life, from different parts of the world, united by something they love. They help create memories filled with laughter, nostalgia, frustration, achievement, and togetherness. This is why we originally created Discord: we wanted a simple and easy way to capture and enable these feelings we experienced growing up playing games with friends. But, over the past year, we’ve been asking you what really makes the magic of Discord. It turns out that, for a lot of you, it wasn’t just about video games anymore. Games are what brought many of you on the platform, and we’ll always be grateful for that. As time passed, a lot of you realized, and vocalized, that you simply wanted a place designed to hang out and talk in the comfort of your own communities and friends. You wanted a place to have genuine conversations and spend quality time with people, whether catching up, learning something, or sharing ideas. A place where you and your world can truly belong. You came to us and said Discord was this place. And for millions of you, it already felt like a home. Today, many of you use Discord for day-to-day communication. You’re sharing thoughts about books, music, and art, creating servers to just be yourself and share moments with friends. Since we launched in 2015, Discord has grown to more than 100 million monthly active users . You spend 4 billion minutes in conversation daily across 6.7 million active servers . On a weekly basis, that’s 26 billion server conversation minutes across 13.5 million active servers. These numbers humble us. It’s incredible to see the impact that Discord has made on your lives over the last five years. We designed Discord for talking. There’s no endless scrolling, no news feed, and no tracking likes. No algorithms decide what you “should” see. We designed Discord to enable the experience and feelings we wanted to recreate: being together with your community and friends. You’ve made your servers into personal spaces filled with people you invited and set the topics of discussion. Your communities all have their own rules and norms of engagement, giving people fun roles and adding inside-joke emojis. Discord is your place to talk. In asking you what you want Discord to be, we heard that you want Discord to be more welcoming, more inclusive, and more trustworthy so more kinds of communities can find a home here. Many of you told us that the biggest misconception you hear about Discord is that it’s “only for gaming,” but you feel Discord’s for “literally everyone” and “for anyone who likes to talk.” As you’ve used Discord for more and more than playing games, our branding didn’t keep up, and the way we talked about ourselves sent the wrong signal to the world, making it harder for you to bring your broader community on Discord. And we know that the first few interactions someone has with our service could be intimidating because Discord is complex with many features. Today, we’re inviting the world in to reveal what we’ve been working on, all designed to make it easier for you to invite your communities and friends to your Discord home. And this is just the beginning. We’ve streamlined the new user onboarding experience and added server video so it’s easier than ever to get together. There are new server templates that make it super easy to help your friends create new servers. We’ve fixed hundreds of bugs, increased voice & video capacity by 200 percent, and continue to invest in reliability and performance as our top priority. We’ve also made the jokes and references within the app less gaming specific to make sure everyone can take part in the fun and make Discord more welcoming. And we’re launching a new website with a new tagline: Your place to talk. We’re also always working on keeping Discord safe and making it hostile to hate. We recently launched a Safety Center so everyone can understand our rules, know what behavior is acceptable or not on Discord, and the tools at your disposal to protect yourself from content or interactions you don’t want. We will continue to take decisive action against white supremacists, racists, and others who seek to use Discord for evil. Recently, on Juneteenth, we announced new company improvements and initiatives to strengthen civic engagement, social justice, and diversity on Discord. You can read more detail here . This is just the beginning of Discord’s journey to be a place for all of your communities to talk and build relationships. We’re around for the long haul. Many of you have already signed up for Nitro, which has taken off over the last couple of years, and our recent $100 million in additional funding will help accelerate our investment in the community, new features, and the company. We’re deeply thankful to everyone who has supported us to get where we are today. We all spend a lot of time in front of our screens. As we look back at the last few months, it’s clear that as people spend more and more time online, they want online spaces where they can find real humanity and belonging. This is what Stan and I were doing when we were teenagers sitting at home playing games, and it’s why we created Discord. It’s been a remarkable and humbling adventure to bring this experience to life. We’re thrilled to be able to take the magic of online games and bring it to the rest of the world: the power to create belonging. And we’re excited to work with you to continue to improve Discord. As always, let us know your thoughts and suggestions by hitting us up on Twitter at @jasoncitron and @svishnevskiy. Expect to hear even more from us in the coming months about how we are working to help you bring your world to Discord.

We are horrified by the murder of Breonna Taylor, of Rayshard Brooks, of Ahmaud Arbery, of countless other Black people across America, and disgusted by the continued police brutality against the protestors. Racism is not only something you consciously do. It is not just vicious comments and violent acts. It’s insidious. Racism is baked into our institutions and our way of life, from education to property ownership to voting. And it’s a reality faced by Black people and people of color all around the world. If we don’t create change where we can, we are complicit in perpetuating white supremacy and the oppression of Black people. As Discord, one of the most popular communications services in the world, it is our duty to use our large sphere of influence to help in unique ways. We have a responsibility to ensure that Discord is not used for hate, violence, or harm. Our goal is that Discord is used to build meaningful relationships and strong affirming communities. Today, on the day that commemorates the effective end of slavery in the United States, we want to share the concrete actions that we are taking to achieve this goal. We created a company task force focused on identifying and implementing actions we will take from a product, policy, and people perspective to make Discord more diverse, more trusted, and more inclusive, for our users everywhere. The taskforce is led by our COO, and we’ll back it with the right resources to implement its recommendations quickly and comprehensively. They will focus on three main areas for action: How we can combat hate on Discord How we can use our reach and scale to promote justice How we can act as an employer to train, hire, and retain underrepresented people This taskforce has already identified and started to implement across these three areas: Like every mainstream communications service, we have to contend with people using Discord to promote hate and to abuse others. To be clear: hate has no place on Discord. As we’ve grown as a company, we have taken decisive action to make Discord hostile to white supremacists, racists, and other groups who seek to use Discord for evil. We have invested in people — Trust & Safety is one of the largest teams at Discord — and in technology to proactively identify and ban bad actors from the platform. In 2019, more than half of the servers we removed for violent extremist content — many of which were white supremacist servers — were removed proactively by our team, before they were reported to us. We will keep increasing that number. In recent weeks, we have been monitoring our platform very closely to find and remove anyone seeking to use Discord to organize around violent extremism or disrupt protests. Today, we commit to two additional actions to make sure we are as effective as we can be against the spread of hate on Discord: We will undertake a third-party audit by an organization active in researching the spread of hate and racism to observe how Discord works, how we enforce our policies, and to make recommendations for us to be more effective. And we’ll share what we learn so others in the industry can make use of their expertise. We are investing significant engineering resources internally to develop software to find and manage abuse proactively. We commit to an open source strategy, which means other companies can benefit and build on what we learn. We hope this also inspires companies to release their tools so users can benefit across platforms. As a platform used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, we have a responsibility to use our reach to help those who use their voices to advocate for change and support civic engagement and social justice. Starting next week, we’ll begin to use our in-product screens and our blog to raise awareness of anti-racist causes and encourage you to take concrete action, such as calling on local officials to advocate for police reform. Over time, we’ll be reaching out to community organizers, civil society groups, advocates, and activists who are on Discord to offer them support and develop resources specifically for them, including dedicated customer support. We want the Discord team to reflect the diversity of society. Today we’re committing to: Diversifying our senior leadership team as soon as possible. Recruiting a full-time Head of Diversity & Inclusion who reports to our Chief People Officer to ensure these efforts have dedicated attention and full responsibility. An internship program starting in 2021 geared to underrepresented groups with a 5-year goal of training the next generation of Discord leaders. We will also look at ways of supporting and donating to important charitable causes. Two weeks ago, Discord donated a combined $150,000 to the Equal Justice Initiative , the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , the National Bail Fund Network , and the George Floyd and Breonna Taylor Family Funds. We’re also giving our employees two days every year to do volunteer work for causes they support. We are grateful that we have funds to donate to important causes, but know donations must be accompanied by actions. We would also like to take this moment to encourage everyone to take the time to learn more. Here are some resources to start you on that journey. We plan to share more in the near future: Talking About Race — An educational portal built by the National Museum of African American History and Culture, providing tools and guidance to help readers learn more and inspire important conversation. The museum is the only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African American life, history, and culture. NPR’s Code Switch — A weekly NPR podcast run by a multi-racial, multi-generational team of journalists who cover both race and identity. Code Switch covers those messy, uncomfortable, essential conversations with the nuance and depth they deserve. Dr. Robin DiAngelo discusses ‘White Fragility’ — University of Washington Professor Dr. Robin DiAngelo reads an excerpt from her book, “White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism.” Dr. DiAngelo explains the phenomenon of White Fragility and discusses how you can develop your capacity to engage more constructively across races. Anguish & Action — Collection of resources curated by the Obama Foundation aimed at inspiring, empowering, and connecting people to change their world — this resource list is focused on helping readers learn what they can do to create a more just and equitable world. Our efforts to combat racism will require time, resources, and sustained attention. This is only the start of Discord’s journey. We’re committed to being in it for the long haul. We will keep you updated on our progress every quarter, and we know that you, our users, will hold us accountable.

So far, we’ve raised over $66,000 for the LGBTQ Freedom Fund thanks to everyone’s help! We’re keeping donations up through the end of the month, and every little bit counts. If you’d like to contribute, hop on over to the donation page . Everyone knows Pride Month is better when you have people to celebrate with. Today, we’re opening the floor to a few of our Partnered Community servers. These servers include the Gay Geeks, Spectrum, Gaymers, and Gayozera communities in the Discord Partner Program. We encourage you to check ’em out and show your support! Who knows, you may even meet some new friends along the way. 💖 Gay Geeks is an all-inclusive environment about your hobbies, gaming, or just discussing your favorite geeky fandom. Gay Geeks was first established in 2010 before starting a Discord in 2017. Trophias, the server owner, shares some backstory: “We have had a Facebook community for just about 10 years (decade birthday in December hype!) and we wanted to embrace and get closer to our community even more. We decided, ‘Hey, we should upgrade our community and get a live chat!’ Almost three years later, it’s been a major success and we’re all loving it.” We may be large, but we do our very best to ensure everyone is taken care of. Take a peek at the #welcome-new-members & #rules channels, then type out a short introduction about yourself in our #getting-started channel! Gay Geeks will be hosting a handful of gaming events, giveaways and Server Video group calls so server members can get to know the moderation staff better. Gay Geeks is joinable at discord.gg/gaygeeks . Founded in 2017, Spectrum is the official partnered server of r/LGBT and is a queer only server aimed at providing a community for queer people to meet others like them, as well as a place for young, questioning users to discover their own identities. “In 2017 I watched police shoot and kill a friend of mine, who also happened to be the only other non-binary person I’d ever met at that point.” August Grey, owner of the Spectrum server, was new to the Atlanta area at the time. In an instant, one of the few people they could connect with in the world was gone. I decided to go online and create Spectrum, both as a Discord for r/LGBT and as a space for me to find my own community and place in the world. Three years later, I’ve found quite an amazing one. We’ve had users get married, have kids, meet their best friends, and just truly become who they were meant to be in Spectrum. During Pride month, Spectrum will be featuring different queer identities and providing information about them, along with dedicated channels to share their experiences. Spectrum will also be running an “Inktober-style” art contest with different themes each day and invites users to get creative. You can join the Spectrum server at discord.gg/lgbtq . Gaymers is one of the longest-running LGBTQ+ servers on Discord, starting back all the way in December 2015. ThomasShaped explains, “It started as a gaming community but has grown into much more than that, providing a safe and fun place for LGBTQ+ people of all ages to hang out and chat.” “As I was coming to terms with my identity, I was looking for a space where I could meet, chat, and play games with other LGBTQ+ people. I couldn’t quite find a community where I felt I fit.” Brandon, the original owner of the Gaymers server, came up with a simple but effective solution to this conundrum: starting a new server. After almost 5 years and nearly 10,000 members later, we say it worked out pretty well. The Gaymers community plans to hold celebratory giveaways, movie nights, and even running a live drag show within their server. Gaymers will also be opening a #moment-of-pride channel, sharing posts about important moments from LGBTQ+ history. Share your own stories of when you’ve felt empowered, included, or prideful in yourself or as part of the community. Head on over to discord.gg/gaymers join their Discord community. First launched in 2016, Gayorzea is a community for Final Fantasy XIV’s LGBTQ players. “It is a welcoming & friendly safe space for LGBTQ gamers and allies. We provide a means by which players can connect with, reach out to and play with like-minded individuals,” explains Discord Partner Lethys. “As we’re primarily targeted at a specific player base, we are able to foster relationships and support pocket communities such as guilds, streamers, artists, and others by giving them visibility to an audience that is more likely to share their interests. We feel that many online gaming environments can be dominated by cisgender men and so it’s also nice for LGBTQ women, queer and transgender individuals to have a private space to reach out to each other and hang out.” For Pride, Gayorzea runs one of FFXIV’s biggest gatherings for LGBTQ gamers. “We hang out, we chat, we make our characters look FABULOUS, and have a laugh, we march a little and take screenshots for memories!” If you’re looking to recreate a parade while stuck inside, maybe it’s time to hop into FFXIV.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "why discord still maintains a browser only experience", "author": ["Cody Sanchez"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-still-maintains-a-browser-only-experience-eb40d54b5a40", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Five years ago, Discord launched as just a browser app. No desktop app, no phone. Some of you may be gasping at this ancient secret. At the start, we wanted to be confident that everyone could access their conversations and hang out with their friends from anywhere, without having to worry about downloads and installations. Supporting a fully-functional, browser-only experience was the best way to achieve this goal. This ease of use still holds true today. Wherever you happen to be, on whatever kind of computer you’re on — even if it’s that weird hotel computer no one usually touches — if it has a web browser, then we have you covered. With newer features such as QR Code Login, you can sign into the web app in the blink of an eye, and save your precious phone battery for more important uses. Using a public computer? Be sure to sign out when you’re done, or use an incognito browser tab so you don’t have to worry about signing out once you close the window. We’ve also been expanding the number of browsers we support. In addition to the currently-supported browsers Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, we recently implemented proper support for Safari! Along with keeping up with all the latest major features such as Server Video, we also squashed a handful of voice-related bugs, including: Joining a voice channel for the first time will automatically try to unmute and get the proper device permissions. You’ll no longer speak into the abyss until someone notices you haven’t been talking since you joined. After leaving a voice channel, microphone and camera access will be properly restored to the rest of your system. This means your web browser will stop saying it has access to your devices when it hasn’t actually been using them for a while. Joining a voice channel while intentionally muted no longer shows that we can’t hear any input from you. No matter where Discord goes from here, or what sorts of snazzy new devices are released in the future, Discord will always be available to use in your browser of choice, no matter what sort of operating system it runs. If you can open Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Safari on it, you can use Discord. On the off-chance you happen to come across a bug in the browser app that’s in need of squishing, we’d love your help in continuing to make the browser app the best it can be! Hop on over to our Discord Testers server and let us know if you see anything fishy…or crawly. Whether you’re on a weekend road trip, you’re visiting extended family and need to borrow your cousin’s PC, or just want to check in while at the library, your friends and communities will always be a quick QR scan away at discord.com/login .

The first Pride was the Stonewall Riots in New York in 1969 led by Black and Brown transgender women like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera amidst the civil-rights movement. Much of today’s milestones for gay rights is thanks to the efforts of queer BIPOC, but there is still a lot of work to be done. This year, we’re excited to announce that our annual Pride fundraiser campaign will be supporting the LGBTQ Freedom Fund , an organization that assists with posting bail to secure the safety of LGBTQ people held in jail or immigrant detention in the U.S. According to the LGBTQ Freedom Fund , tens of thousands of LGBTQ people are imprisoned because they cannot afford bail, some reasons being immigration status or simply sleeping in public. The LGBTQ Freedom Fund predominantly bails out Black and Brown LGBTQ individuals, working with them to ensure they get access to medical services. This includes free HIV Testing/education, access to PrEP/PEP, referrals to medical screenings, and hormone replacement therapy performed by medical professionals. Starting today until the end of June, we’ll be launching our annual Pride fundraiser campaign featuring an exclusive Wumpus Pride pin. The Pride pin showcases the Progress Pride Flag, original design by Daniel Quasar , which seeks to be more inclusive of the marginalized groups within the community. Along with the traditional rainbow color scheme for the Pride flag, it includes black and brown stripes to represent marginalized BIPOC, along with the pink, light blue, and white colors to represent the Transgender Pride Flag. The first 2700 people who donate at least $20 will be able to order a celebratory Wumpus Pride pin, with 100% of donation proceeds going to the LGBTQ Freedom Fund. We’re expecting the pins to start arriving in everyone’s hands in early August. Whether it’s $20 for a pin or a $2 donation, every little bit helps. You can grab a pin by heading to our Tiltify page here . Even after our donation drive ends, that doesn’t mean the fight is over. The Freedom Fund works year-round to release LGBTQ+ and POC individuals from incarceration. In addition, we’d like to showcase a handful of additional organizations that focus on LGBTQ+ communities of color: The Marsha P. Johnson Institute : An organization protecting and defending the human rights of Black transgender people by organizing, advocating, creating an intentional community to heal, developing transformative leadership, and promoting collective power. SNaPCo : An organization aimed at building the power of Black trans and queer people to force systemic divestment from the prison industrial complex and invest in community support. The National Black Justice Coalition : A civil rights organization dedicated to the empowerment of Black LGBTQ people and people living with HIV/AIDS, with the mission of ending racism and stigma towards LGBTQ people. The Black Trans Advocacy Coalition : A national organization led by Black trans people to collectively address the inequities faced in the Black transgender human experience. Black AIDS Institute : An organization working to end the Black HIV epidemic through policy, advocacy, and high-quality direct HIV services. The Okra Project : A collective that seeks to address the global crisis faced by Black trans people by bringing home-cooked meals and resources to the community. We encourage everyone to continue to organize at the local level, protest, and demand change. In addition, if you aren’t able to donate to our Tiltify campaign but still want to help out, you can spread the word by sharing the campaign link with anyone who may be interested. We’re not done yet though! We’ll be back in a few days to give the spotlight to some Partnered LGBTQ servers that are celebrating Pride month.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "wave hello to server video", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/wave-hello-to-server-video-85dcef1128f0", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com After a few weeks of roll-out, Server Video chat is finally available to everyone on desktop, web, and iOS, with Android coming soon. With Server Video, you can see all of your friends’ lovely faces on a video call without having to juggle between personal or Group DMs. Just join a voice channel, hit the video button, and smile :) At this time when everyone’s stuck inside their homes, Server Video’s user limit has been temporarily increased from 10 to 25 participants. Video chat itself has been part of Discord since late 2017, so you might be asking yourself… Servers are more suited for drop-in, drop-out conversation . There’s no need to hassle with asking who’s going to start the call in your DM first or shuffling between your giant list of messages to find that * one* DM from months ago that had the perfect combo of friends. Either hang out in a video call with a few friends or just chill by yourself so others can see when you’re open to talk. In addition to just video chatting, server video offers the ability for you to both Video Chat and Go Live at the same time , allowing you to show your own camera while you’re streaming a game, or sharing your screen. This can be super useful for situations such as holding a small art stream on your server. Stream your digital art application using Go Live while explaining your creative process to your friends using Server Video, liiiike this!: Pro tip: If you’re watching a Go Live stream and see someone else is streaming in the same channel, try shift-clicking on the second person’s window. You’ll be able to watch multiple streams at once! This secret feature isn’t fully fleshed out, so it might be a bit temperamental. A few years ago, we brought video chat to DMs. Even to this day, long-time users and even some Discord staff still remember when the question “ screenshare when ?” was almost a meme in itself. Since then, bringing video chat into servers has been a long-awaited feature . A few dedicated folks have even used *ahem* certain workarounds to get an early version of video chat working on their server. When we found out we’d all be stuck inside, we decided to prioritize helping everyone spend more face to face time together when they’re on a server, and remove the need for insider knowledge of funky workarounds in order to see their friends. Features and changes are brought into production because we’re not just making Discord for others — we use Discord ourselves (crazy). From big features like Server Video to small quality-of-life improvements like being able to crop your avatar while uploading, updates to Discord are driven by community feedback. Speaking of quality-of-life improvements, along with Server Video, the Discord team pushed out some video chat improvements to the Chrome version of Discord’s web app, meaning you’ll no longer need to install a browser extension for video chat to work on Chrome. For Mac users, Safari is now officially supported ! Go Live also fully works in all supported browsers, so you can both video chat and screen share without having to install the desktop app. Sprinkled on top of everything are some small but much-needed fixes, including a fix for a * very* specific issue where joining a voice channel while muted on browser would permanently show that we can’t hear any input from you. Whether your idea is big or small, we’d love to know what you think. Let us know what you think about Server Video on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram , or on the Discord subreddit . We may not be able to reply to everyone, but we read everything that’s shared. Now go spend some time with your friends in video chat! We hope it’ll help bring you closer to the ones you care about the most. Imagine a Place 712 5 Product 712 claps 712 5 Written by Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "the future of bots on discord", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/the-future-of-bots-on-discord-4e6e050ab52e", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com In case you weren’t aware, robots have taken over. The Robot Revolution began on December 21, 2015 with the release of our “Unofficial API” . On April Fool’s Day 2016, we shared a preview of what was to come: Airhorn Solutions. In its first week of life, you used Airhorn bot over 500,000 times in over 8,000 servers. Discord was much smaller back then, so those were huge numbers! We learned two key things: Bots can be powerful tools People love air horns Next came the introduction of our official API . This was the start of putting tools in the hands of our developer community. That original checklist was coming along quite nicely: Since those early days, we’ve seen over 3 million bots created to date, and they’ve sent 9.5 billion — yes, with a B — messages this year alone. An ecosystem of bots and developers flourished, and became an integral part of the Discord experience. We’ve come a long way from those days of automated user accounts and reverse engineering internal APIs, which we’re all totally done with, right? Frankly, you’ve blown us all away. Your tools and creations are integral to Discord, from moderation bots keeping our public spaces neat to bots that help you run a full Dungeons and Dragons campaign . You never cease to inspire us. This year, we’re beefing up our internal muscles. We have a dedicated team that focuses full time on bots, our API, and our developer ecosystem. Their job is to support and improve the things you all make, teach other users how useful bots can be, and keep our platform safe for everyone. As you may have seen, we’ve already rolled out some pretty big features like: New endpoints and gateway events for managing invites and message reactions New OAuth2 screens so server owners can make more informed and safer decisions when enabling bots Gateway Intents , providing massive savings in the resources it takes to run a bot Better controls for mentions in messages for bots, because nobody likes an unwanted ping And we aren’t stopping there. For the longest time, bots have been something that Discord has supported, but not properly embraced. The ecosystem has grown tall from grass roots and community support. You’ve found novel ways to use features that were not designed with bots in mind, but nevertheless succeeded. This year, we aim to help. Let’s build features specifically for bots. Let’s take some of those hacks, workarounds, and less-than-perfect UI and UX elements and give you ways to polish and perfect them. Let’s recognize your success and show you off! Finally, let’s make sure that we all continue to stay safe on Discord, so that everyone can fully enjoy what you make. We’re in the midst of working on a brand new way for bots and applications to interact with Discord. The specifics are still being worked out, but spoiler alert: It’s pretty awesome. Bots will be simpler to use. They’ll feel like natural extensions of Discord, polished products for desktop, web, and mobile users. Developers will get powerful new tools to take their creations to the next level. It’ll be easier to turn great ideas into code. So, how will that all happen? See for yourself! The links below are made in a design software called Figma. They’re prototypes, which means that you can interact with them. Clicking anywhere on the design will make interactive UI elements flash to guide you through the process. If you want to go back to the start, just press R . NOTE: You guys really loved these bots so it may be hard to see these links right now due to volume of users. Check back later if so! Catch ’em all with BattleBugs ! Learn something new with TranslateBot ! Pick your favorite with Pollinator ! These are all just examples of what this new API interaction could create. What we build throughout the year may look and function differently from what you see here. But, really, we couldn’t just keep these to ourselves. You’ve worked hard on your bots. We want to recognize that hard work. We also want users to be able to find your bot in the world and know that you’re legit! This blog post marks the start of something new: a Verified Bots program. Starting today, qualified developers can apply for verification in their bot’s settings in the Developer Portal. We’ve partnered with Stripe as an identity verification provider, and you’ll be required to submit a document for valid photo identification. Don’t worry, Discord is not storing any information you provide. If you are unable to provide this, please reach out to our support . We’ll also ask some security questions about your bot. We hate lengthy forms as much as anyone, so we promise they’re not cumbersome. Once you’ve gotten verified, your bot will receive a Verified check mark, so people know it’s legit! Verification is a big step in the world of Discord bots. It’s the secure foundation we need to unlock new features and visibility for developers. Verification means that we can release features that give developers more control over Discord. It means we can encourage users to adopt bots within Discord, instead of scouring the internet. It also means that bots can safely grow orders of magnitude larger than they are today. Protecting user privacy and security, as well as maintaining trust, is our utmost responsibility. We want to ensure that we continue to uphold that as our bot ecosystem grows. Therefore, we are making verification a requirement for bots in 100 or more servers. Until your bot is verified, you will not be able to grow past 100 servers. If your bot is already in more than 100 servers, it will not be able to join any more. We recognize that this is a big change, so we’re instituting a 6 month deprecation period ending on October 7, 2020 to get everyone verified that meets the criteria. Until that date, no restrictions will be enforced. Verification is open to any bot in more than 75 servers, so you can get a head start. You can read more about the Verification process in our help article . As part of the verification process, we’re including an opt-in process to get whitelisted for Privileged Gateway Intents . We believe that whitelisting access to certain information at scale, as well as requiring verification to reach that scale, will be a big positive step towards combating bad actors and continuing to uphold the privacy and safety of Discord users. Again, this only applies to bots in 100 or more servers. You may start the process as early as 76 servers, and you have until October 7, 2020 to complete it before limitations are enforced. We are committed to shipping replacements to any whitelisted data that is necessary for bots to function, as well as things to be addressed in the future, like message content. We will work with you, our developer community, to ensure that what we build meets our standard of quality. The future for bots is bright, and as you can see, it looks a little different from what you’re used to. We’ll be hard at work this year making bots and applications a first class part of the Discord ecosystem, as they should be. We’d love for you to be a part of that discussion by joining our official Discord Developer Server . There, we’ll be sharing the latest news and updates, answering questions about Discord’s API (current and future!), and providing some sneak peeks of new features. Talk with us directly to help shape the world of Discord bots to come. If you run a bot in more than 75 servers, get verified! And don’t forget to apply for Privileged Gateway Intents if you need them as well. See your bot’s settings page for more info. Remember, you have until October 7, 2020 before anything is enforced. More info can be found in our help center article . If you have questions or want some help, come talk to us in Discord as well! Most importantly, keep bringing your amazing creations to life. We can’t wait to see what you make. Imagine a Place 5.3K 47 Product 5.3K claps 5.3K 47 Written by Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses.

We also know that many people who aren’t directly affected by the virus have still seen their lives disrupted, including school closures, canceled community gatherings and small businesses struggling to keep operations running smoothly. We’ve heard from so many of you over the past few weeks. People — particularly in regions harder hit by COVID-19 — are already using Discord to keep in touch and stay on track with their everyday lives, from attending classes remotely to working from home. We wanted to find a way to help, so we’re temporarily upping the limit on Go Live to 50 people at a time, up from 10. Go Live is free to use and lets people privately stream or screen share apps from a computer while others watch on any device — so teachers can conduct a class, co-workers can collaborate, and groups can still meet. You can learn more about how to get started with Go Live here . While we created Discord to bring people together around games, we’re thrilled that so many of you are using it in so many different ways. We’ll maintain the higher user limit as long as it’s critically needed — we hope it makes peoples’ lives just a little easier and a little less stressful day-to-day.

Making memories with friends and giving you an easy place to talk with them and belong is what we’re all about. Keeping our voice quality amazing has always been important to us. This is especially true right now. We’re seeing regions impacted by COVID-19 turn to us to stay in touch with their friends and family. Yesterday, we highlighted some of the amazing ways that our community has turned to Discord during these times through things like virtual classrooms, remote working, online workout classes, and weekly D&D game nights. In Spain and France, the daily number of people talking on Discord has more than doubled since the beginning of 2020; in Italy, it’s more than tripled. In the US, we are seeing a 50 percent growth in daily voice users, with the highest growth in states like California, New Jersey, New York, and Washington. To support everyone coming online, we’ve been working fast to help out where we can, such as extending our Go Live limit up to 50 people and increasing our capacity for smoother overall service. Bringing noise suppression to Discord voice chat It’s difficult to control sounds happening around you. As people are choosing to work, study, and hang at home on Discord, we would like to help everyone who may be stuck in a non-ideal situation. Today we’re rolling out a new noise suppression feature early in beta in partnership with Krisp.ai. This new tech detects and removes background noises happening around you so your voice can be heard clearly. Have a vacuum running in the background; slam a door; ruffle a bag of chips; keep using your really loud keyboard your friends complain about. They won’t be able to hear it. Heads up: No voice, user, video or any data is ever sent or shared outside of Discord. Krisp runs on your device to cancel out noise — no data is ever sent to their servers under any circumstances. Noise suppression arrives to Discord today and will roll out to 100 percent of desktop users. The feature is still in early beta. We’re still working on improving it. While also working on mobile support! But we decided to release it early as we didn’t want to wait on technology that can be helpful in a lot of your current situations. You’re able to toggle on this new noise suppression feature in any voice or video chat by clicking the noise suppression button. Additionally, you can toggle Krisp on in your Settings under “App Settings” → “Voice and Video” → “Advanced” → “Noise Suppression” You can learn more about how this noise suppression works through our Help Center article here . We’d love to hear your feedback, and we hope that it can help you as you use Discord to stay connected to your communities around the world.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how to use discord for your classroom", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-to-use-discord-for-your-classroom-8587bf78e6c4", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com You’ve been telling us stories of how you’re using Discord in all sorts of amazing ways during the COVID-19 pandemic. We’ve seen classrooms come together, workers without an office find a new place to connect, and tons of surprising uses. To help out where we can, we recently announced that we’re temporarily raising the user limit on Go Live from 10 to 50 people. One of the main reasons we made this change was to help teachers. With high schools and college campuses closing in many parts of the world, more and more of them are turning to Discord to make sure their students don’t fall behind and can continue to learn. And we’ve been flooded with requests from educators asking: What can I do with Discord? To put it briefly, Discord offers: A dedicated, free to use, invite only class space for classes like AP US History Text channels to organize things like lessons, homework, or study groups so students can go over the latest Pre-Calculus assignments together Voice channels for both one-to-one and group discussions, or even office hours A real-time teaching environment where lessons can be shared with up to 50 people at a time If you’re an educator, you might be new to Discord. We created a fast, one-click way to get you started. Just click here and you’ll breeze through the Discord signup and automatically get your own pre-organized classroom space. We’ve also pulled together an overview of how to use Discord for online learning. Please note that the minimum age to join Discord is 13, so younger students won’t be able to use the service. You can download and sign up for Discord for free on desktop , iOS , Android , or via your web browser . Here’s a quick feature rundown: Discord is made up of invite only spaces known as servers — think of your server as your classroom. Servers are organized into individual channels where you’ll interact with students or other teachers. There are text channels , where anyone can post messages, upload files, and share images for others to read at any time. And also voice channels, where teachers can conduct classes with Go Live, and students can get together to talk and collaborate. As noted above, you can get going quickly by using this simple template , which will give you a server that looks and feels like this: You can customize and organize your Discord created from this template however you like. Change the server name, channel names, and organize your students with powerful roles. Once you’ve got your server set up as you want, it’s time to invite your students to join you! Discord’s Go Live feature allows you to teach a class for as many as 50 people, regardless of where they are. Students don’t see you, they only see what you’re sharing on your computer. As you present, you can take questions and call on students just as you would in a traditional classroom. The session can’t be accessed by anyone outside the server. To get started, join a voice channel (click the 🔈symbol), then click the 🖥 icon in the voice status panel near the bottom left corner and a new window will pop out. Just pick the application window or screen you want to share, press the “Go Live” button, and you’re sharing with students. If you want to create a server for your class from scratch, click here for step-by-step instructions. We wanted to provide a quick overview of Discord, and there’s a lot more that educators can do. As you explore, you’ll see it offers almost limitless options for customization and organization, so you can make your classroom space exactly as you want. It’s inspiring to see dedicated teachers doing everything they can to keep educating. While we hope schools can be reopened as soon as possible, we’ll do whatever we can to help in the meantime. If you have questions, or just want to let us know how you’re using Discord so others can learn, we’d love to hear from you on Twitter . Unfortunately, we aren’t able to publish our blog posts into multiple languages here.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord is bringing people together", "author": ["Cody Sanchez"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-is-bringing-people-together-e215bbd41ad9", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com In 2015, Discord was launched as a way to bring people together around games. In the early days, Discord was initially shaped to be the ideal chat app that we wanted to use when playing Final Fantasy XIV until sunrise. Fast forward to 2020, Discord has grown from a small project to becoming the de facto place for not just gaming communities, but for tons of unique groups and gatherings around the globe. In this difficult time when staying at home is the safest thing you can do, Discord has started to play a vital role in helping friends and family members stay in contact. We recently asked the community on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram how they’ve been using Discord lately. There were stories about everything: from staying in touch with friends and family, to keeping track of classwork, all the way to flexing your creative muscles in an art collective. Go Live — something initially designed for video game streaming — was being used to hold virtual yoga sessions and make sure weekly D&D game nights were still going strong. Popcorn with chopsticks not included, sadly. Discord can be set up how you want it, with organized channels and categories about anything you can think of. Thanks to this flexibility, Cyndie , a parent of two in North Carolina, uses Discord for nearly everything in her family life when not playing Pokemon GO. “There are four of us and we all have Discord installed on both our computers and phones. Everything gets dropped into that server. From dinner’s ready to internships and job offers. Usually it’s the silly, stupid stuff we just drop in that makes us all laugh, like when there’s a Weird Al question on Jeopardy.” Whether you’re a family keeping in the loop with your day-to-day plans, an Animal Crossing player hunting for the best turnip prices, or a study group keeping up with assignments, the most important aspect of these communities that connects them all together is the human element — being able to talk to those you care about the most. “ It’s so important to feel connected to our teachers and each other when we are so isolated and in such a difficult class,” says Genavieve , who takes one of the toughest AP courses at her school. “Using Discord brought us closer together as a physics class — we are already a small class of 22 students, so being able to joke around and send memes helps us not feel so alone during the distance learning.” Content creation has also shifted in the last few months, with many transitioning to working from home. Video sites that rely on having a studio to stay consistent in production quality no longer have access to their sets. For Greg Miller and the team at Kinda Funny , the team’s transition from a studio to solely Discord has been smooth sailing, with their producer Kevin being able to run the show from home, just like he used to at HQ. Greg explains, “ the decision to work from home was simple: we wanted to protect our Kinda Funny family. However, *how* to move an entire YouTube/podcast business with at least two live shows a day was a bit more complicated.” “Discord was the answer, and I can’t get over how easy it was. Every one of our shows is produced using Discord because of it’s near-zero latency, ease of use, and video quality. I’ve been blown away by the quality of the videos it’s helping us put out. ” All sorts of shows and podcasts can take place on Discord. In addition to the recent releases from Kinda Funny, “ Chris Gethard Presents ” is a New York-based comedy show that not only live streams every week, but has a home for their comedy community on Discord. Comedunity… communedy…? Now, before you say “but Discord, my #memes channel IS my comedy venue,” hold up — this works a bit differently than you’d first think. Bryson, a digital producer who helps run the Discord for Chris Gethard Presents, says on Saturdays, the CGP community runs an Open-Mic night inside their Discord. The open mic can be about anything from a poem to a song, or just a way to make the community laugh. “ The different channels and @mentions make it much easier to keep information straight ,” adds Genavieve about Discord in general. “ Screenshare makes it even easier, so we can show each other documents or problems we are working on to get feedback or troubleshooting advice. ” Hopefully the rest of Genavieve’s classmates are actually paying attention in the middle of schoolwork… The communities shown above are just a small selection of how expansive the possibilities can be. Because Discord has started to play an important role in helping friends and family members stay in contact, we recently released a new feature called Server Templates . Server Templates allow you to share how you have your own server set up with someone else, making the setup process easy with a single click. We encourage everyone to create and share any templates that could be helpful for both new and experienced Discord users. Do you think you could set up an ideal yoga community? What about a hiking one? Now that baking bread is suddenly in style, the world could use a baking-centric Discord to compare how their sourdough turned out. Share any templates you create by mentioning us on Twitter at @discord . Helping others get a jumpstart on Discord with something like a server template can be the final *click* that someone needs to show them that Discord can be useful for anything and everyone. “Seriously, Discord is always open on my computer,” added Cyndie. “I can’t imagine life without it.” Imagine a Place 573 2 Community 573 claps 573 2 Written by Discord is the easiest way to talk over voice, video, and text.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "discord transparency report april dec 2019", "author": ["Gabe Madway"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/discord-transparency-report-april-dec-2019-7e6d43a9bcb8", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com We created Discord in 2015 to bring people together around games, and it’s amazing to see the different ways people today use it to talk with their friends and communities. However, with tens of millions of people active on Discord every day, keeping bad content and malicious behavior off requires vigilance — from both us and our users. While the Trust & Safety team makes life difficult for bad actors, our users play their part by reporting violations — showing that they care about this community as much as we do. Last year we published our first-ever transparency report , providing a detailed snapshot of the work we do to ensure a safe and positive experience on Discord. As we continue to invest in Trust & Safety and improve our enforcement capabilities, we’ll have new insights and learnings to share. The next report will land in August as we move to a bi-annual cadence. Discord’s overall user base grew significantly in 2019, and we also saw an increase in reports over the course of the year. We received roughly 176,000 over the last nine months, representing a 12% average monthly increase from the first three months. Our Trust & Safety team also grew in 2019, and we took more enforcement actions than ever before. Discord banned around 5.2 million accounts from April to December 2019 — the overwhelming majority of those for spam violations — and banned nearly 20,000 servers. While this may seem like a sizable increase from our last report, that is largely due to a change in reporting methodology, which we go into greater detail about below. Finally, we were also able to remove a majority of servers responsible for worst-of-the-worst exploitative and extremist content before any bystanders had to encounter them or their content. The Trust & Safety team spends much of its time responding to your reports. We encourage people to report any activity they believe violates our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service , and we investigate every report thoroughly. This chart breaks down the 176,000 reports we received by type of violation: You may notice that the category breakdown in the above chart looks somewhat different from last year . The “Other Issue” category has shrunk, in part because we’ve added two new categories, “Incomplete Report,” and “Platform,” to provide greater detail and context. Broadly speaking, platform violations involve behavior that abuses our API, such as creating a selfbot or spamming our API with invalid requests. Incomplete reports refer to situations where there wasn’t enough information to determine whether a violation took place, so no action was taken. The chart below shows how we responded to every report from April to December of last year. (For more information on action rates and what they mean, check out the first Transparency Report .) The highest action rates typically occur where there’s both a high degree of verifiability and the issue affects a lot of people, like spam or malware. Correspondingly, if it’s an interpersonal conflict between two people, the action rates tend to be lower because the facts are often difficult to verify. It’s also worth noting that in cases such as self-harm reports, child endangerment, or imminent harm, “actioning” may mean escalating to authorities outside Discord. You’ll notice that the action rate of harassment reports is relatively low. That’s because harassment is a broad category that includes bad behavior of different types and levels of severity, some of which can be stopped simply by blocking a user or banning them from a server. For example, we receive reports from new users about how someone using foul language is harassing them. In those cases, we’ll educate them about the block function but not take any action on the reported user. On the other hand, the action rate for doxxing — posting personally identifiable information — is fairly high. We take these reports extremely seriously and if confirmed we almost always ban the violator, in addition to deleting the content. Reports of malware and spam also see fairly high action rates, in part because there isn’t much gray area in what that constitutes. In our first Transparency Report we only reported bans of users with a verified email address. This was because having an unverified account often indicates it’s a throwaway or duplicate account used by bad actors. However, as noted in the Summary section above, we are changing the reporting methodology, and going forward will report total account bans . To be fully transparent, and to make it easier to compare numbers historically, these are the ban figures from our first report using the new methodology: We can now provide a more comprehensive overview of 2019. In this chart, we’ve grouped bans by category and tracked them across all four quarters. You’ll notice this chart uses a logarithmic scale, since spam is such a huge category compared with everything else. In the last nine months, close to four million spambots were banned and removed from the platform , mostly by our anti-spam filters. Still, spammers are constantly evolving their behavior and we’re investing more in resources to catch them even earlier. Ultimately, we don’t think people should have to spend any time thinking about spam or protecting against it. The second-largest type of user bans is exploitative content. We’ll go into more detail about this category a bit later since we’ve made an aggressive push to remove all users who engage in this behavior. In addition to taking action on individual users, we may also ban servers that violate our Terms or Guidelines: Responding to user reports is an important part of Trust & Safety’s work, but we know there is also violating content on Discord that may go unreported. This is where our proactive efforts come in. Our goal is to stop these bad actors and their activity before anyone else encounters it. We prioritize getting rid of the worst-of-the-worst content because it has absolutely no place on Discord, and because the risk of harm is high. Exploitative content is a major focus of our proactive work, more specifically non-consensual pornography (NCP), where intimate photos are shared as “revenge porn,” and sexual content related to minors (SCRM). We have a zero-tolerance policy for this activity and when we find it — either through reactive or proactive means — we remove it immediately, along with any users and servers sharing the content. In cases involving child sexual abuse material, we swiftly report the content and the users to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Another focus area for proactive enforcement is violent extremism, where we continue to take aggressive action on both groups and individuals. Violent extremism, in broad terms, is content where users advocate or support violence as a means to an ideological end. Examples include racially motivated violent groups, religiously motivated groups dedicated to violence, and incel groups. So, what does proactive work entail? We don’t proactively read the contents of users’ private messages — privacy is incredibly important to us and we try to balance it thoughtfully with our duty to prevent harm. However, we scan 100% of images and videos uploaded to our platform using industry-standard PhotoDNA to detect matches to known child sexual abuse material. When we find someone who is engaging in this type of activity, we investigate their networks and their activity on Discord to proactively uncover accomplices or other sources of the content. Here are the results of our proactive work from April through December 2019: In all three of these areas, over half the servers were removed without bystanders having encountered their content. On average, about 70% of NCP servers were deleted before they were reported, and close to 60% of SCRM and extremist servers were deleted proactively. We’re committed to putting even more resources into these proactive efforts. No system is perfect, and even if our team is confident we took the right action, there may be mitigating circumstances or information that wasn’t originally available. Accordingly, every action taken on an account can be appealed by the user. When considering an appeal, Trust & Safety reviews the original report and takes into account the severity of the current violation and any previous violations by the user or server. It’s worth noting that most users who successfully appeal do express remorse, take responsibility, or provide a deeper explanation of what happened. Between April and December 2019, we banned upward of 5.2 million accounts, and just slightly under 16,000 of those were reinstated on appeal. Here’s a breakdown of the unbanning rate by category: The outlier in the unban category is platform violations. This is largely due to cases where users have (either knowingly or unknowingly) created a selfbot. It’s common for people to not be aware that this violates our Terms, so we’re often willing to give users who appeal the benefit of the doubt. Every single malicious act on Discord is one too many. We want Discord to be welcoming for everyone, and we promise to do our part by working aggressively to stop bad behavior before it happens, while respecting people’s privacy. In 2020 you can expect continued transparency from Discord. Thank you for putting your trust in us and for choosing to build your community here.

Our goal is to improve Discord with new features that don’t make it bulky and take away from the core chat experience. There are two areas in the app where we weren’t hitting these marks: Activity Feed and the Library. As of today, we are saying goodbye to both of these features. The Activity Feed was meant to give you an easy way to stay up to date with game news and let you quickly see what your friends are up to . It wasn’t serving either of these purposes well and added bulk. To help you stay up to date , last fall we launched Channel Following: a way for you to beam important announcements from Verified and Partnered servers directly to your own server . Since you pick what you follow, Channel Following offers more control and customization over the updates you receive from your favorite games, communities, content creators, and streamers. You use Discord to hang out in your servers with your friends. We want you to customize those spaces with the stuff you care about, and not have to worry about opening Discord and seeing updates for a game you played once 8 months ago…oh Activity Feed… To quickly let you see what your friends are up to , we’re also moving Now Playing to the Friends tab. We are also saying goodbye to the Universal Game Launcher and Library tab. Improving also means removing features that our users aren’t finding useful, like the UGL and Library tab. We’re removing both of these to keep your Discord experience fast and clean. If you have bought or will buy a game from Discord, your games will always be accessible. The Library tab will stay for you, and you’ll have the option to disable it from User Settings > Appearances. As always, drop us a message if you have a suggestion and thanks for reading.

Two of those were particularly severe, on the 7th and 8th, resulting in hours of downtime each. This is clearly unacceptable, and we’re sorry. We understand how important Discord is to each of you — whether you’re talking to friends, playing games together, or building your communities — and these kinds of interruptions are just not okay. We want you to be able to rely on us to be there for you, and we’ve let you down. The TLDR is that we’ve grown a lot this past year (in terms of users and features), and we did not stay ahead of that growth in a couple of places that have been behind the recent outages. To address this, As of last week, we’ve reprioritized most of Discord’s infrastructure engineering team to be part of a new Reliability Strike Team . Among them are some of our most senior engineers. The goal of this team is to focus on improving the stability and performance of our platform for the rest of the year and through 2020. The team has already worked through the weekend and shipped dozens of improvements , including adding more capacity to many of our systems and reducing load on our main user database by about 50%. We believe that, with these improvements already deployed and more to come this week, the majority of the incidents that have been happening will not continue to happen. The work does not stop here. We will continue to double down on stability investments throughout the future. Discord is supposed to just work — wherever you are, whatever you’re doing. That’s our goal, and we haven’t been hitting that. We’re sorry, and it’s our promise to you that we’re doing everything we can (and making progress!) towards fixing this. I know this blog post is brief and light on detail (because we’ve been busy fixing things!) but stay tuned. We will write up and share the technical details of these recent outages, what we’ve been doing, talk about the details of our infrastructure plans for next year. Thanks for reading.

Users with devices on Android 4 will still be able to use the existing Discord Android app but simply won’t receive any new updates (except for critical security patches, and some important upcoming features). While we don’t make this decision lightly, the goal of this change is to speed up the development of the Android app. This should make it both faster and easier to bring new features and bug fixes to the app. By increasing our minimum version of the Android app, we unlock new features and APIs that the app is able to take advantage of. The time we would spend writing code to handle split functionality if the OS version is below Android 5.0, can now be more valuably invested into moving the Android app forward. These code blocks, BE GONE! If you are interested in what bumping your minimum SDK up unlocks, you can read a great post by Kaushik Gopal on Github: github.com As you can see, there is widespread consensus that Android 5 (API 21) should be the standard minimum going forward: Our primary concern and the reason we delayed this decision for so long was the number of existing users we may be cutting off from updates. For the past year, we have been closely looking at what percentage of our users are running each OS version. In November 2018, Android 4 users composed roughly 4% of our Android active devices. By March 2019, that number slid to 3%. Unsurprisingly, it kept sliding as our userbase purchased new phones or upgraded their phone’s OS. By July 2019 it was 2%, and as of this month, November 2019, it's down to 1.5%. Not only is this due to our rapidly growing userbase with newer phones, but the actual number of Discord users on Android 4 is on a steep decline . It’s not a happy moment for us to tell some users they need a new device to keep using the latest Discord Android app, but we believe what this unlocks will enable us to make a higher quality app in less time. We hope you understand our decision to stop supporting Android 4.0. We gave this decision considerable thought and time before making the switch. However, in the end, we think this will improve Discord for our users in the long run.

We know this may be a surprising change, so If you want to cancel your Nitro subscription because of this, we’re offering a refund: you can contact our team here . With this change, we have the resources to refocus. We’re going to double down on making sure Nitro nails its mission: more features, fun, and enhancements for hanging out in Discord with the people you care about.

A bit ago we added a Server Boost , a way for Nitro subs to support their favorite communities and share their perks with everyone in a server. We recently launched Go Live , a simple way to stream gameplay directly to your friends, and Nitro subs got to try it out early. Moreover, we added 1080p 60fps and Source Go Live streaming to Nitro Classic and Nitro, respectively. Today, we’re also launching a doubled upload size of 100mb for Nitro $9.99 subscribers . We’re also working on ways to make your Nitro boost more powerful. To start, we’re reducing the number of boosts needed to reach Level 3 by more than half — from 50 to 20 . Back in late 2016, we launched Discord Nitro. For a monthly price, people could support us and get some cool perks for their account. While the nuts and bolts of Nitro have changed since three years ago, the spirit remains the same: keep Discord’s core features free . Nitro features should feel like enhancements to the core Discord experience. And that means giving you more. More ways to express yourself and more ways to customize your experience, like uploading your friend’s face, chest, and arms as your own custom Exodia emoji set. Moreover, unlike many other free apps, Discord does not make money from ads. And because we don’t make money through ads, ad buyers are not our customers. Our customer is you! And this means we need to make Discord the best it can be for you. We are constantly looking for and listening to feedback. We’ve shipped a ton of user requested features to date, and we won’t stop there. Those of you who have seen Discord grow over the last four years know that we’re constantly improving, adapting, and experimenting. Everything from our interface to Nitro itself has evolved as we learn how to make Discord better, faster, and stronger. We also cannot continue to improve without your feedback and support. Thank you for being here with us as we continue our journey to bring people together around playing games. Can I play Nitro games until October 15th, 2019? Yes. Current subscribers will still have access to these games until October 15th, 2019. Will this change affect Nitro Game Perks or any games I purchased in my library? No. Games purchased on Discord and Nitro Game Perks will be unaffected. Imagine a Place 2.5K 179 Product 2.5K claps 2.5K 179 Written by Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "why discord is switching from go to rust", "author": ["Jesse Howarth"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Rust is becoming a first class language in a variety of domains. At Discord, we’ve seen success with Rust on the client side and server side. For example, we use it on the client side for our video encoding pipeline for Go Live and on the server side for Elixir NIFs . Most recently, we drastically improved the performance of a service by switching its implementation from Go to Rust. This post explains why it made sense for us to reimplement the service, how it was done, and the resulting performance improvements. Discord is a product focused company, so we’ll start with some product context. The service we switched from Go to Rust is the “Read States” service. Its sole purpose is to keep track of which channels and messages you have read. Read States is accessed every time you connect to Discord, every time a message is sent and every time a message is read. In short, Read States is in the hot path. We want to make sure Discord feels super snappy all the time, so we need to make sure Read States is quick. With the Go implementation, the Read States service was not supporting its product requirements. It was fast most of the time, but every few minutes we saw large latency spikes that were bad for user experience. After investigating, we determined the spikes were due to core Go features: its memory model and garbage collector (GC). To explain why Go wasn’t meeting our performance targets, we first need to discuss the data structures, scale, access patterns, and architecture of the service. The data structure we use to store read state information is conveniently called “Read State”. Discord has billions of Read States. There is one Read State per User per Channel. Each Read State has several counters that need to be updated atomically and often reset to 0. For example, one of the counters is how many @mentions you have in a channel. In order to get quick atomic counter updates, each Read States server has a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache of Read States. There are millions of Users in each cache. There are tens of millions of Read States in each cache. There are hundreds of thousands of cache updates per second. For persistence, we back the cache with a Cassandra database cluster. On cache key eviction, we commit your Read States to the database. We also schedule a database commit for 30 seconds in the future whenever a Read State is updated. There are tens of thousands of database writes per second. In the picture below, you can see the response time and system cpu for a peak sample time frame for the Go service.¹ As you might notice, there are latency and CPU spikes roughly every 2 minutes. In Go, on cache key eviction, memory is not immediately freed. Instead, the garbage collector runs every so often to find any memory that has no references and then frees it. In other words, instead of freeing immediately after the memory is out of use, memory hangs out for a bit until the garbage collector can determine if it’s truly out of use. During garbage collection, Go has to do a lot of work to determine what memory is free, which can slow the program down. These latency spikes definitely smelled like garbage collection performance impact, but we had written the Go code very efficiently and had very few allocations. We were not creating a lot of garbage. After digging through the Go source code, we learned that Go will force a garbage collection run every 2 minutes at minimum . In other words, if garbage collection has not run for 2 minutes, regardless of heap growth, go will still force a garbage collection. We figured we could tune the garbage collector to happen more often in order to prevent large spikes, so we implemented an endpoint on the service to change the garbage collector GC Percent on the fly. Unfortunately, no matter how we configured the GC percent nothing changed. How could that be? It turns out, it was because we were not allocating memory quickly enough for it to force garbage collection to happen more often. We kept digging and learned the spikes were huge not because of a massive amount of ready-to-free memory, but because the garbage collector needed to scan the entire LRU cache in order to determine if the memory was truly free from references. Thus, we figured a smaller LRU cache would be faster because the garbage collector would have less to scan. So we added another setting to the service to change the size of the LRU cache and changed the architecture to have many partitioned LRU caches per server. We were right. With the LRU cache smaller, garbage collection resulted in smaller spikes. Unfortunately, the trade off of making the LRU cache smaller resulted in higher 99th latency times. This is because if the cache is smaller it’s less likely for a user’s Read State to be in the cache. If it’s not in the cache then we have to do a database load. After a significant amount of load testing different cache capacities, we found a setting that seemed okay. Not completely satisfied, but satisfied enough and with bigger fish to fry, we left the service running like this for quite some time. During that time we were seeing more and more success with Rust in other parts of Discord and we collectively decided we wanted to create the frameworks and libraries needed to build new services fully in Rust. This service was a great candidate to port to Rust since it was small and self-contained, but we also hoped that Rust would fix these latency spikes. So we took on the task of porting Read States to Rust, hoping to prove out Rust as a service language and improve the user experience.² Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector , it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.³ Rust does not have garbage collection, so we figured it would not have the same latency spikes Go had. Rust uses a relatively unique memory management approach that incorporates the idea of memory “ownership”. Basically, Rust keeps track of who can read and write to memory. It knows when the program is using memory and immediately frees the memory once it is no longer needed. It enforces memory rules at compile time, making it virtually impossible to have runtime memory bugs.⁴ You do not need to manually keep track of memory. The compiler takes care of it. So in the Rust version of the Read States service, when a user’s Read State is evicted from the LRU cache it is immediately freed from memory. The read state memory does not sit around waiting for the garbage collector to collect it. Rust knows it’s no longer in use and frees it immediately. There is no runtime process to determine if it should be freed. But there was a problem with the Rust ecosystem. At the time this service was reimplemented, Rust stable did not have a very good story for asynchronous Rust. For a networked service, asynchronous programming is a requirement. There were a few community libraries that enabled asynchronous Rust, but they required a significant amount of ceremony and the error messages were extremely obtuse. Fortunately, the Rust team was hard at work on making asynchronous programming easy, and it was available in the unstable nightly channel of Rust. Discord has never been afraid of embracing new technologies that look promising. For example, we were early adopters of Elixir, React, React Native, and Scylla. If a piece of technology is promising and gives us an advantage, we do not mind dealing with the inherent difficulties and instability of the bleeding edge. This is one of the ways we’ve quickly reached 250+ million users with less than 50 engineers. Embracing the new async features in Rust nightly is another example of our willingness to embrace new, promising technology. As an engineering team, we decided it was worth using nightly Rust and we committed to running on nightly until async was fully supported on stable. Together we dealt with any problems that arose and at this point Rust stable supports asynchronous Rust.⁵ The bet paid off. The actual rewrite was fairly straight forward. It started as a rough translation, then we slimmed it down where it made sense. For instance, Rust has a great type system with extensive support for generics, so we could throw out Go code that existed simply due to lack of generics. Also, Rust’s memory model is able to reason about memory safety across threads, so we were able to throw away some of the manual cross-goroutine memory protection that was required in Go. When we started load testing, we were instantly pleased with the results. The latency of the Rust version was just as good as Go’s and had no latency spikes! Remarkably, we had only put very basic thought into optimization as the Rust version was written. Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version. This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go. But we weren’t satisfied with simply matching Go’s performance. After a bit of profiling and performance optimizations, we were able to beat Go on every single performance metric . Latency, CPU, and memory were all better in the Rust version. The Rust performance optimizations included: Changing to a BTreeMap instead of a HashMap in the LRU cache to optimize memory usage. Swapping out the initial metrics library for one that used modern Rust concurrency. Reducing the number of memory copies we were doing. Satisfied, we decided to roll out the service. The launch was fairly seamless because we load tested. We put it out to a single canary node, found a few edge cases that were missing, and fixed them. Soon after that we rolled it out to the entire fleet. Below are the results. Go is purple, Rust is blue. After the service ran successfully for a few days, we decided it was time to re-raise the LRU cache capacity. In the Go version, as mentioned above, raising the cap of the LRU cache resulted in longer garbage collections. We no longer had to deal with garbage collection, so we figured we could raise the cap of the cache and get even better performance. We increased the memory capacity for the boxes, optimized the data structure to use even less memory (for fun), and increased the cache capacity to 8 million Read States. The results below speak for themselves. Notice the average time is now measured in microseconds and max @mention is measured in milliseconds. Finally, another great thing about Rust is that it has a quickly evolving ecosystem. Recently, tokio (the async runtime we use) released version 0.2. We upgraded and it gave us CPU benefits for free. Below you can see the CPU is consistently lower starting around the 16th. At this point, Discord is using Rust in many places across its software stack. We use it for the game SDK, video capturing and encoding for Go Live, Elixir NIFs , several backend services, and more. When starting a new project or software component, we consider using Rust. Of course, we only use it where it makes sense. Along with performance, Rust has many advantages for an engineering team. For example, its type safety and borrow checker make it very easy to refactor code as product requirements change or new learnings about the language are discovered. Also, the ecosystem and tooling are excellent and have a significant amount of momentum behind them. If you made it this far, you’re probably newly excited about Rust or have been excited for quite some time. If you want to work on interesting problems using Rust professionally, you should consider working here at Discord. Also, a fun fact: the Rust team uses Discord to coordinate. There’s even a very helpful Rust community server that you can find us chatting in from time to time. Click here to check it out. [1] Go version 1.9.2. Edit: Graphs are from 1.9.2.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "light theme redeemed", "author": ["Kevin Wilson"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/light-theme-redeemed-c541b7ab13e9", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com This is a story of light theme’s redemption. So sit back, remove your protective eyewear, and let’s go on a journey. Maybe you’ll even find yourself using light theme in the coming days. That said, you probably don’t use light theme today. In fact, there’s an overwhelming chance that you use Discord’s dark theme if you’re a Discord user. As of this writing, the percentage of Discord users on light theme is in the single digits — and not even the higher ones. To understand light theme’s fall from grace, we must go back to the earliest days of Discord — 2015. Most people don’t know this, but the earliest versions of Discord contained only one theme. Light Theme. Then, everything changed on August 6th, 2015. You remember how you were the center of attention until your younger sibling came along? They were easier on the eyes, resonated more with your friends, and — I’m not sure this metaphor is working anymore — dark theme was released to the world . Dark theme quickly became the main theme. Even within our office, it was hard to find more than one or two actual light theme users. Our small team of designers didn’t design with it in mind when creating new features. It became an afterthought. Testing on light theme was rare, and considered a chore. Light theme began to atrophy due to this way of thinking, and we’re embarrassed about that. So what did that lead to? It eventually became a Discord community inside joke that light theme was bad and you were bad for using it. Kotaku even wrote an article about it. There are dozens of Reddit posts in our subreddit about the shortcomings of light theme, along with some pretty good memes, like this one: We even joked about it occasionally: Ultimately, working on light theme sucked. “Why work on something that barely anybody uses, that we get made fun of for, and needlessly slows us down?” On more than one occasion, we debated removing the theme entirely. Then, in April of this year, we kicked light theme while it was down. We “deleted” light theme as an April Fools Day joke. We thought it would be funny to poke fun at ourselves for one day — and many dark theme users agreed. While many had laughs, this wasn’t all good. We did not account for the users that preferred light theme for accessibility reasons. Many angry light themers gave us a piece of their mind. Acknowledging our mistake, we turned light theme back on earlier than intended. After realizing we made an embarrassing error, we felt energized to make things right. A small two person crew of an engineer and a designer had been working through a total refresh of Discord’s interface — and underlying code — over the past half year (if you’re an eagle-eyed Discord user, you may have noticed changes to the top bar, server list, and channels list in the past months). We decided that the next step for this crew was to give light theme the face lift it needed. We also needed to find a way to change the culture around light theme. We needed make it easy and fun to work on light theme, or at least build it in such a way that designers and engineers wouldn’t have to think about it. We had some ideas about how to fix light theme, but we needed actionable data. After looking into our internal data about light theme usage, we perused the dozens of results about light theme on our feedback site . We gathered hundreds of survey results from an April Fools Day post-mortem in our /r/discordapp subreddit and our dedicated Discord Testers server . We even spoke to the two light theme employees at Discord. (Hi Christine and Bonnie!) A large majority of survey respondents said the dark sidebar in light theme felt out of place. Many people were used to how light themes look on other apps and wanted consistency. “As many have probably already said, make the sidebar light on light theme, it would be a great thing to start with.” Another large majority of respondents had problems with the low color contrast between the text and background color in chat. Many people said the same thing about dark theme’s contrast as well. The contrast isn’t sufficient on the dark theme for me to read anything. This is an issue regardless of monitor settings. A few users surfaced other accessibility issues, specifically ones related to our grey text on a white background, or trouble with dark theme’s dark background. I find that dark colours tend to ‘swallow up’ lighter colours, especially given that Discord’s text has such narrow lines. Because of this it’s very difficult to read and I have to strain my eyes, which starts to cause a headache after just a few minutes. From this, we knew that we had to do 4 main things: Develop a new color palette with more pleasant light tints. 2. Improve accessibility by increasing contrast levels and bumping up small and thin fonts — on both themes for good measure. Here’s what we did: There are some tradeoffs where the contrast is increased, but still fails contrast tests for certain small text. We’re considering ways to alleviate that, such as increasing contrast on hover in the future. 3. Give light theme an appropriately-themed sidebar . 4. Lastly, establish a system for designing and building light theme that would be easy to design and test , to prevent problems in the future. Two things we’ve implemented so far are Color Mappings and an Auto-Themer plugin for our design tool, Figma. One way we made light theme easier to work with is a color mapping system. Previously, we would design for dark theme and then duplicate the design and apply colors as appropriately as we could for light theme. This would result in some pretty different designs depending on the situation and the designer doing it. This new mapping system will help us not only create patterns between the themes, but establish patterns within the themes. For our background mappings, we established how colors would look on each theme in various areas, such as backgrounds, divider lines, cards, and more. This isn’t a perfect system, as there are plenty of one-offs, but this takes us 80% of the way. The above foreground mappings are for text and icons. While building this, we made sure to do some accessibility testing on our range of backgrounds. We had to make a few tradeoffs where some text (namely, muted channel names) will not pass accessibility tests. Furthermore, these mappings get applied as CSS variables in code. What this means is that when an engineer starts applying colors to new components, they’d give the component a single variable like --foreground-1 that assigns color depending on the theme. Previously, if the light theme color was forgotten in code, it’d fall back to the dark theme color and look completely wrong. Now, that should no longer happen. A bonus point: If we choose to adjust the mapping, this would ripple through the app with a single change. Variables! While we haven’t applied this mapping system to every surface of the app, we’re getting closer and will eventually fully implement it as the app is further redesigned and rebuilt. Now that we implemented a mapping system, one of our designers — Daniel — had an idea: can we automate it? Turns out, you can. He quickly threw together an amazing tool for us — a plugin that looks for applied dark theme styles and converts them to light theme styles based on our mappings. With these systems and tools in place, light theme will be way faster and easier for our entire design team to work with moving forward. We’re sure there will be feedback and things to learn after this release. We’ll be listening and looking for ways to improve. A similar new light theme look for iOS and Android. The next phase in our redesign. We can’t tell you what or when, but some parts of Discord that need love will be getting it soon. We’re always looking for the next great addition to our product team at Discord. If you are passionate about design, user experiences, and keeping light theme a first class citizen, hit us up .

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord achieves native ios performance with react native", "author": ["Miguel Gaeta"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-achieves-native-ios-performance-with-react-native-390c84dcd502", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Early on at Discord, we adopted React Native as soon as it was open sourced to build our iOS app from the core of our React app. Years later, we are still happy with that decision. Our iOS app currently sees many millions of monthly active users, is 99.9% crash free, and holds a 4.8 star rating on the app store. React Native has been instrumental in allowing us to achieve this with a team of only three core iOS engineers! The ergonomic benefits of using it as our foundation have remained compelling as time has passed. Features are greatly simplified due to the extensive amount of code sharing we leverage. Furthermore, engineers who primarily work on the Discord web app in React can easily jump into the iOS codebase and be productive — even building and owning entire vertical slices. However, towards the beginning of the year we started to notice that the app had appeared to have degraded across several vectors (frame drops, battery drain, time to interaction, etc) and it was unclear why. When we originally built the app in 2015 it performed quite well on an iPhone 5s, which served as our baseline model. Now in 2019, the app was nearly un-usable on the four year old iPhone 6s. What happened? Even when using a top end iPhone XS, the app could not maintain 60 FPS in normal usage, provide smooth gestures, and had a noticeable impact on battery life. We knew that our app was once fast, and we wanted to more deeply understand if the problems we were seeing could be tackled on our end, or if the issue was more deeply rooted in React Native itself. With this in mind, we created a mobile performance squad, whose mission was to execute a deep dive into driving top tier performance on across all supported iOS devices. We would like to share what we have learned! Our first idea was to investigate our data flow (Discord pre-dates Redux , but our architecture is similar) for potential performance bottlenecks. We had many stores running many actions and believed some expensive dispatches could have been the cause of the problem. We started by adding some basic logging that showed time spent processing each of our dispatch actions across stores. Next we limited our logging to only show dispatches that took longer than 10ms and immediately saw some points of interest. Every action that triggered an update to our user store — which holds the state of all known users — resulted in a 30ms emit. Our message load/cache restore actions — which directly result in processing and rendering our chat messages — resulted in a 500ms on an iPhone XS and 1000ms on iPhone 6s! While neither of these actions were directly causing stutter or frame drops, they were clearly wasting a lot of CPU and battery. By using the Chrome profiler we realized that one of our top level components was listening to the user store updates. This was problematic since as it was top level, it rendered many children (of which many were not pure ). On a very active account, these costly actions and subsequent renders were happening every second. By removing the dependency from the top level component and instead re-working it so that our child components that more directly required the users listened to it instead, we shaved 30ms from those dispatches. Nice! Meanwhile, the message load/cache actions were initially baffling because they were optimized before and known to be fast in React. Surely if they were this slow, our desktop user’s would have noticed. We switched to the profiler, and unfortunately found that the actions were only taking 20ms in Chrome , which is not what we were seeing in the simulator/device. What we were dealing with was a difference between V8 and JSC , which we learned by switching back to basic logging to directly observe the impact on a device. After wrapping the components listening to these actions in some timings, it revealed that the bottleneck was in our markdown parsing . We found that a big cost factor was our escape rule, which was inline compiling a massive regular expression. The fix was easy since the regular expression could have been a constant ( never compile regex's inline in a tight loop! ). This was great because it cut the cost down by 30% and now we were at 350ms on iPhone XS and 700ms on iPhone 6S . That is a 15-30FPS gain on loading messages, and directly translated to reduction in TTI — for us this means being able to navigate the UI! Unfortunately, we were still left with an unacceptable amount of time being spent parsing messages. After further digging we realized that running our Unicode emoji detection was extremely expensive on JSC but basically free on V8. We were — for the last four years — concatenating hundreds of Unicode symbols into a single regular expression which apparently is not a good idea. Luckily, someone brave had created a good Unicode emoji range regex that we could use instead. This removed nearly all the remaining cost! We were down to 30ms on iPhone XS and 90ms on an iPhone 6S . That was a 90% reduction from where we started, shaved nearly a second from TTI, and generally reduced CPU and battery usage significantly! This phase netted a lot of big and easy wins! Unfortunately, while all actions were now under a few milliseconds, and the app ran better, our goals were not yet reached. Basic logging was no longer giving actionable information, which meant any remaining CPU cost was coming from React’s commits which run on separate ticks. It was time to figure out how to determine the cost of our component hierarchy. At first we tried to use the Chrome profiler again since React 16+ snapshots its commits in the profiler. However, it records way more than just React. We were also not interested in the cost on V8 since we were trying to improve performance on JSC. Luckily, both of these could be solved since late last year the React team released a React Profiler that focuses on render time, great! So we fired up the profiler, hit refresh, and then clicked around. A few things quickly jumped out: Our React commits could cost up to 200ms when affecting things at the higher levels of the component tree. On top of this, we were going through up to three commit passes when the app was starting up. When viewing the direct message list, we were looping over the whole list on every render to do sorting (some power user’s could have up to 1500 channels). We had a lot of common views like <Icon> constantly re-rendering despite having no changes in props or state. While these were cheap to render, they added up. FlatList and SectionList , which powered all of our lists, are very expensive and their virtualization is not yet fully optimized . In large servers, for our channel and member lists, they ended up slowly allocating thousands of views which become slow to unmount. Updating our channel list could cost up to 100ms . Jackpot! There were a lot of actionable items, but not as trivial as the Flux store performance pass. Fixing the three commit passes was surprisingly simple. When React Native was released, there was no easy way to get the current dimensions of the screen so we relied on the very first render to trigger an onLayout which we sent to a ScreenStore for others to consume. Luckily, React Native has since improved the Dimensions module by giving it more information and firing events when they change. We made a change so that our stores could initialize with the correct data, avoiding multiple commit passes and even shrinking the view hierarchy. This actually shaved about 150ms off TTI since diffing the tree at the top level was not cheap. Fixing the frequent looping over the whole channel list on render was also very trivial, and almost felt silly that we hadn’t fixed this code years ago. We already had a store that maintained a sorted list of the user’s direct messages. This drop in replacement shaved about 2ms per render, but if you were viewing direct messages with a long list of many active users, this would happen quite frequently. A lot of engineers at Discord used to default to using PureComponent since it avoids renders if props don't change. Unfortunately, it isn't that simple. When creating a component, one should consider how it will be used and if the props will rarely change, or if the component should just be a pass though and give the rendering decision to its children. Another thing not always clear to our engineers, was that style and children are just like any other prop and if you are passing a style as an array or dynamically creating style objects, you are breaking PureComponent , the same goes for children . Unless explicitly controlled, any children are just creating new components which never pass an equality check. With the above in mind we did a pass over our most commonly used Component’s — removing unnecessary instances of Pure and minimizing our use of dynamic styles. All of this work resulted in about 30ms being shaved from rendering when doing common actions like switching channels. Lists have always been a headache in React Native. We’ve actually implemented our core chat view natively because lists don’t perform well for many dynamic rows. We always hoped and assumed that React Native lists were good enough for simpler use cases like our channel and member lists. Unfortunately, despite the React Native team rewriting lists and promising better performance, memory usage and virtualization of the built-in FlatList and SectionList did not meet our expectations. One of the reasons that built-in lists have performance challenges is because they support a lot of features, and do aggressive pre-rendering as a solution to combat the fact that the underlying <ScrollView> renders in the main thread and JavaScript has to feed it more content as you scroll. What this means is after a <FlatList> mounts, it eventually renders all its rows slowly every frame. Using the Perf Monitor , it could be seen that when looking at large Discord servers, they mounted nearly 2000 views. Since this is a known pain point in the React Native community, there are already solutions to this problem. We spent some time first testing out react-native-large-list which was immediately a significant improvement, brought down rendering down to 60ms , and only ever rendered about 400 views in large Discord servers. It was not the best to work with because it required restructuring our data that was already computed for both iOS and Desktop in stores, but it was a trade off that we could deal with. Unfortunately, when using the library for much larger lists (eg: 100,000 rows) like channel members, it would lock up the CPU. Next we found recyclerlistview which actually worked even better! It had similar results in the amount of views it mounted, and it was able to keep 60 FPS fill rate on scroll. What was better was that it brought down rendering to 30ms for server switching, and channel switching down to 10ms ! Unfortunately, despite trying to trick it via many methods, it suffered from one frame blanks on mount, weird scroll positions when trying to scroll to an item on mount, and the sticky headers implementation conflicted with Animated . At this point, we were out of open source solutions. So we either had to settle on recyclerlistview or come up with our own solution. At first, we felt that maybe doing it purely in JavaScript was futile. We spent some time trying to glue together UITableView with React Native, and while we made meaningful progress, it started feeling overly complicated. After stepping back and thinking about what else we could do — it hit us. We already solved this problem once before on the web! We already had an internal List component that virtualizes its children. There is no way we could just drop it into React Native right? We replaced <Scroller> with <ScrollerView> and <div> with <View> and dropped it in. It worked! Right out of the box it performed almost as well as recyclerlistview and was able to use nearly the same code for rendering as the desktop app. We then spent some additional time adding sticky header support and using some similar techniques employed by recyclerlistview to recycle views - avoiding allocations both on the React and UIKit side. The result was a new component we called <FastList> . The team intends to merge these together for cross-platform use and open source it for the community. With that we removed a lot of memory allocations and were down another 70-90ms of render time. We could now scroll the channel members list as fast as we wanted and it kept up admirably. This phase took a lot more work since it required writing some new libraries. It net resulted in over 100ms render time savings in common app usage patterns. The app was now performing great during active usage! So now that Flux stores were performing well, and components were not spending a lot of time rendering — there remained a few big mysteries: When opening the emoji picker for the first time, the UI froze for up to 2s on an iPhone XS and this didn’t show up anywhere in JavaScript profiling. When coming back from backgrounding the app, switching between a direct message and server for first time froze the UI for up to 2s on an iPhone XS . If that was all happening just after an initial boot it could have been explained away with resources needing to be loaded into memory, but it was also happening after backgrounding… what could it be? We suspected the emoji picker itself was the source of the UI lockup, but we knew that if it was something purely related to resource loading we only would have seen the issue once per app boot. So we started adding logging to every ancestor component of our emoji picker and found that our chat input component was remounting when switching between private messages and servers! Oddly, the remount didn't seem expensive after the first time it remounted. More importantly, these components were never supposed to remount by design, so why were they? It turns out they were wrapped in a different root component depending on context, and changing a component type in the tree is just like setting a different key . Merging the two components reduced the 2s lockup down to 500ms , which was a win but not yet fast enough. While the component was now loading much faster, there was still the mystery of why is still remained relatively slow. What was even weirder is we could not reproduce this on a development build and only on a production build. What was different between the two? One thing we saw was that all app bundled images were loaded via development servers in dev mode but stored in memory caches for production. Before diving deeper we tried a simple test. We deleted all the images from disk and launched the app. It was fast, which meant indeed something about the image loading was the root cause. So we took console.log 's long lost cousin NSLog and decorated all the local file loading code for RCTImage with call times. RCTImage loads all local files out of bound using [UIImage imageNamed] on the main thread to avoid flickering. Unfortunately, those calls were taking 50ms each for every call after launching the app or after backgrounding! [UIImage imageNamed] is the de-facto method for loading images on iOS, so, why was it slow? It turns out, React Native was passing it absolute paths instead of referencing named images in the bundle. So, we deleted all the images again and added a few of them to the bundle and tried again. Now, the exact same images were loading in 0.1ms and the app was fast. Unfortunately, this method means we would have to explicitly add all images to an Xcode project and we can't over the air deploy them. So we tried another crazy thing. RCTImage has a fallback to read bytes from disk and pass them into UIImage if [UIImage imageNamed] for some reason does not work. So we commented out the [UIImage imageNamed] calls and let it fall through. To our surprise, without any caching, constantly reading these images from disk and decoding them was only taking 0.3ms ! We were shocked by the result and this could only mean there is some kind of bug in UIKit when handling memory cache misses for files that actually exist on disk. Luckily, React Native allows you to create custom image loaders. So we created a native module LocalAssetImageLoader which reads files directly from disk, decodes them, and manages its own memory cache. This bypassed the bottle-neck we were seeing and gave us blazing fast image loading. Finally, we were still noticing that using Discor d for a bit — even lightly — could result in the battery heating up. While looking at our idle CPU usage we noticed our JavaScript thread was now mostly idle now at 0–5% CPU of 1 core (down from up to 30%), but for whatever reason the main UI thread would sit at 10% CPU when looking at a Discord server. After slowly disabling pieces of the UI until it went away the culprit was the right drawer. While it was closed it always had a spinning animation in the background chewing away at CPU — death by the smallest cut! This phase was great because UI lockups were gone, the app was running at 60 FPS, and loading views with a lot of images was fast again. But better yet, since we were previously spending 50ms per image load on init, the changes immensely helped TTI as well — shaving nearly 2s . However, the additional FPS boost now made some degraded gesture interactions fairly obvious — so we kept going. Even when everything is running at 60 FPS things can still feel slow, and thats where perceived performance comes into play. To tackle this, we chose to focus in on one of the apps core experiences: navigation. One of the primary interactions with Discord involves the left and right drawers. The component that powers them was created the week that React Native was released in 2015, and still suffered from the shortcomings of those times. Drawers are a very gesture based interaction, and when that interaction requires logic to jump between the main thread and the JavaScript thread, it results in the drawers not perfectly following a swipe or finger drag. Due to the dependency between the threads, it also means that if the JavaScript thread is busy the interaction can briefly pause. The other problem with the drawers was that they depended on React Native JS Responder system which works well in most cases, but not when there are gestures and scroll views involved. This could create gesture conflicts, such as trying to open the drawer but instead having the chat view scroll. Our initial reaction was to just create very nice drawers using native UIViews and then expose them to React Native to fill with content. However, we decided to browse around for better animation and gesture modules to see if there was a solution for this. Luckily we found both from the same author who has clearly been working to address this problem. react-native-gesture-handler which exposes UIKit's responder system to React Native and with it we also found references to react-native-reanimated . What makes them great together is that you can connect them to tie gestures to animations — all on the main thread - but you get to write all the code in JavaScript. react-native-reanimated basically exposes an animation logic graph not that different from the way you compose React components and is able to send it to the main thread, run it in a loop, and it can even reference values from other objects on the main thread. Using this we were able to tie the <PanGestureHandler> to an animation of how a drawer works and get a drawer that behaves buttery smooth like any other native app . Best of all it was done with a lot less code. There is more to do with perceived performance and hopefully we as a team can continue to make it better. However, through this work we now had an app that uses way less CPU and battery while running at 60 FPS with buttery smooth interactions! Finally, we decided to apply one final optimization with the hopes of tying everything together into a final TTI drop. This was actually something we had our eyes on for awhile — RAM Bundles . The idea behind RAM bundles is simple: instead of loading one gigantic JavaScript blob, why not break it down into modules that can be lazily loaded as needed? Our build system already was using Haul , and conveniently a plugin already existed to enable them. We got it integrated, but unfortunately we learned that our codebase was not all that modular. Despite this, with some minimal changes it still was able to defer loading some 100 of our 2600 modules, which did still yield a 800ms drop of TTI on an iPhone 6. Going beyond that, we rolled up our sleeves and further inspected the app entry point as a whole and were able to drastically speed up TTI by deferentially loading or omitting several key parts of the code base: Updated our modal, action sheet, and alert API’s to require dynamic imports — thus excluding them from initial load. Stubbed out several key desktop-only features to avoid loading unused React code (such as the Game Store — :c ) on iOS. Always imported lodash since we found that importing submodules actually costs more because duplicate code is loaded. Dynamically import many of our core native modules (such as the Discord media engine) to avoid loading this code until the point in time the feature is actually used. Similarly, employed dynamic imports (inline require) for many of our common feature components to achieve lazy loading. Dynamically imported our entire localization code and associated moment locale code to be deferred until the app had loaded. After all this, we saw a tremendous speed up in the apps initial boot times in addition to the gains we had already achieved. On our benchmark iPhone 6 device, we saw average loading time decreases of 3500ms . On an iPhone XS the average time to load was an additional 700ms faster as well! This final step tied everything together for us — now the app was launching quickly, interacting fluidly, and using much less CPU. Most importantly, the app just felt so much more usable on our iPhone 6 device. It was at this point that we felt our goals had been achieved. When we stepped back from the project we were extremely happy with the final outcome. The aftermath of our work can be directly observed by watching these before and after videos on an iPhone XS, and these before and after videos on an iPhone 6S. While we started by just trying to improve the FPS of the app, ultimately our exploration resulted in: Fluid gesture interactions for our core navigational system. A fairly consistent 60 FPS across our supported devices and a very noticeable reduction in battery consumption. A much better development experience since even the app under development mode runs much better than the production app before these changes. An average of two seconds shaved off the initial load time. This was primarily achieved through our efforts enabling RAM bundles and optimizing our code paths to leverage it. Whats more, this investigation and mitigation was completed within a span of a few weeks. Although there are real pain points and challenges to using React Native, the overall gains significantly outweigh the costs which motivates us to keep investing in the platform.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "discord transparency report jan 1 april 1", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/discord-transparency-report-jan-1-april-1-4f288bf952c9", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com A few months ago we promised to keep the conversation going about Trust and Safety here at Discord . Today, we’re proud to show you our first-ever Transparency Report. While it took longer than expected, we’re proud to show what making tough decisions looks like on a platform of over 250 million registered users. A Transparency Report is a way for us to make visible the reports we receive from our users about bad behavior on the platform and how we respond to them. We believe that publishing a Transparency Report is an important part of our accountability to you — it’s kind of like a city’s crime statistics. We made it our goal not only to provide the numbers for you to see, but also to walk you through some obstacles that we face every day so that you can understand why we make the decisions we do and what the results of those decisions are. T&S receives more than a thousand reports daily and over seven thousand reports a week for violations of our Community Guidelines . This Transparency Report covers the reports Discord received and actions taken from January 1 through April 1, 2019: In these three months, we received a total of about 52,400 reports — that’s 52,400 times that users reached out to us to get help. When users make reports to us, they can select from the following categories in our Help Center , presented here along with examples to illustrate issues we may receive. Harassment: A user repeatedly creates new accounts to message and insult someone who’s already blocked them; members of a server target a user and keep sending them racial slurs (hate speech). Threatening Behavior: One user threatens another, whether explicitly (“I’m going to shoot you”) or implicitly (“you better watch out or something bad’s going to happen to you”). Hacks/Cheats: A server is selling stolen accounts for popular games, or distributing cheats for multiplayer games. Doxxing: A user shares the address of another user’s school, even encouraging others to swat that person. Malware: A user DMs another user a trojan virus disguised as a game patch file in order to take control of their computer. Exploitative Content: A user discovers their intimate photos are being shared without their consent; two minors’ flirting leads to trading intimate images with each other NSFW (Not Safe for Work) Content: A user joins a server and proceeds to DM bloody and graphic violent images (gore) to other server members. Self-Harm: A user is depressed and describes not having a good time in school and not having any friends; a user is explicit about committing an act of self harm. Raiding: A group of users coordinate joining a new server, spamming insults and @everyone mentions at the same time, disrupting that community’s discussion. Spamming: A user — or more likely, an automated spambot — joins a large server and then DMs everyone in that server a meet-someone-now dating site. Other TOS Violation: Users select this category when they’re not sure what to select. For example, a user attempts to compromise another user’s account, or impersonates a Discord staff member, or perhaps someone violates multiple Terms of Service at one time. These categories aren’t set in stone. One of the things that we continue to work on is ensuring people can easily submit reports as needed and that they know what information is required for us to complete an investigation. We’re currently looking at iterating on these categories and making it more more intuitive to report. In the investigation phase, the Trust and Safety team acts as detectives, looking through the available evidence and gathering as much information as possible. This investigation is centered around the reported messages, but can expand if the evidence shows that there’s a bigger violation — for example, if the entire server is dedicated to bad behavior, or if the behavior appears to extend historically. We spend a lot of time here because we believe the context in which something is posted is important and can change the meaning entirely (like whether something’s said in jest, or is just plain harassment). If Trust and Safety can confirm a violation, the team takes steps to mitigate the harm. The following are actions that we may take on either users and/or servers: Removing the content Warning users to educate them about their violation Temporarily banning for a fixed amount of time as a “cool-down” period Permanently banning users from Discord and making it difficult for them to create another account Removing a server from Discord Disabling a server’s ability to invite new users Discord also works with law enforcement agencies in cases of immediate danger and/or self-harm. Any time Trust and Safety acts on a report, we keep a record of that action. Furthermore, we also track the percentage of reports we take action on: A note on the graph above: while this shows how often we took action in each category, the results aren’t always visible to the reporter, and may not be the outcome that users expect or hope for when reporting violations to us. Sometimes a user will follow up to ask what actions we’ve taken, but for many reasons we generally can’t share those specifics. For example, imagine a scenario in which a user faked their own suicide to end an internet friendship (this is a real situation that happens surprisingly often). Their concerned friend reports this user’s messages to us, but in the course of our investigation, we determine that this person is perfectly fine and chatting with their pals on another Discord account. For privacy reasons, we can’t share this with the concerned reporter. From their perspective, it appears that we’re withholding life-or-death information about their friend; from ours, we believe it is correct to protect the privacy of our users (no matter how well-intentioned). False or malicious reports : Sometimes users send us edited screenshots or delete their half of the conversation, hoping to twist someone else’s words out of context. Other times, users band together to report an innocent user, hoping we will blindly ban them, as many other platforms use systems that will automatically remove content if it is reported enough times. Discord does not do this. Unreasonable expectations: We may receive a harassment report about a user who said to another user, “I hate your dog,” and the reporter wants the other user banned. We always factor in the severity of harm and whether the issue can be resolved using built-in moderation tools. In these cases, educating the user on how to handle less-than-ideal experiences on their own goes a long way. Being offended isn’t the same thing as being harassed and we think it’s important as a platform to differentiate between the two. Missing information: We require users to send message links so we can locate the violation and investigate the context. Unfortunately, we often get reports where we don’t have any evidence and are only going on hearsay. Because one of our values is to confirm any violation before taking action, we generally do not act on violations with missing information. Mislabeled reports: While users may categorize their report incorrectly for many reasons, it’s usually because our categories are broad and subject to interpretation (what one user considers “doxxing” may be considered “harassment” to someone else). However, even if a report is mislabeled, we still investigate and review every report. Ultimately, many actions that we take are not immediately obvious to the reporter. For example, when we ban a user or remove a server, the reporting user isn’t notified. We’re generally not able to talk about individual actions for privacy reasons, which can make it difficult for the reporter to gauge the effectiveness of a report. Also, any of the above scenarios will cause a report to be “not actioned” for the category it’s submitted to us as, which is why our action rates don’t tell the entire story. In the first three months of 2019, Discord banned the following accounts per category in response both to user reports and proactive work on Terms of Service violations: For perspective, spam accounted for 89% of all account bans and is over eight times larger than all of the other ban categories combined. Thanks to smart computers and automation, we have been able to stop 100,000 spambots from registering daily. We’re also continuously improving our anti-spam systems. Moreover, we’ve been spending significant resources on proactively handling Exploitative Content, which encompasses non-consensual pornography (revenge porn/“deep fakes”) and any content that falls under child safety (which includes child sexual abuse material, lolicon, minors accessing inappropriate material, and more). We think that it is important to take a very strong stance against this content, and while only some four thousand reports of this behavior were made to us, we took action on tens of thousands of users and thousands of servers that were involved in some form of this activity. T&S frequently updates and iterates on its detection systems for harmful content, including working with other companies solving similar problems and implementing systems such as PhotoDNA in order to detect this content. Amongst all other categories, we banned only a few thousand users total. Relative to our 50 million monthly active users, abuse is quite small on Discord: only 0.003% of monthly active users have been banned. When adjusted for spam, the actual number is ten times smaller at 0.0003%. Every user can appeal actions taken against their accounts. We think that appeals are an important part of the process. Just as you deserve a chance to be heard when action is taken against you in a judicial system, you should have such a chance to be heard when some action is taken against your Discord account. While we weren’t able to prepare the number of appeals made and total granted in this transparency report, we’re looking to add it in future reports. However, through a recent audit of a thousand harassment bans through the first three months of 2019, only two were overturned. Our system, with its emphasis on manual review of a messages context stresses being confident before we take action on an account, so we expect this number to be quite low. We’re not perfect and mistakes may happen even though we go to great lengths to ensure that we’re only taking action when it’s warranted. Accounts are only a part of the story on Discord because of the way Discord is structured. Communication happens between users in DMs as well as servers. Individual accounts may be responsible for bad activity, but as part of our investigations, we also take action where there are groups of users who are collectively violating our Community Guidelines with a server dedicated to such content. Between January and April of 2019, Discord removed the following number of communities for Terms of Service violations: Over half of all the servers we removed were communities dedicated to sharing game hacks and cheats, or selling cracked accounts. When Discord removes servers, one thing we focus on is reducing the spread of harm from strength in numbers. Our graph shows that we most commonly see this as compromising gameplay (posting cheats, selling rare items), but we unfortunately also receive reports of servers focused on spreading hate speech, harassing others, and convincing others to follow dangerous ideologies. Discord takes these reports seriously and removes servers exhibiting extremist behavior. We take a comprehensive approach by reviewing user-generated reports, as well as working with law enforcement agencies, third-parties (such as news outlets and academics), and organizations focused on fighting hate (like the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center) to make sure we’re up-to-date and ahead of any potential risks. Numbers are critical for transparency. But numbers don’t tell the whole story, and they sometimes don’t reflect the nuances of what it means to keep a platform safe. This was especially true on the evening of March 14th when our Trust and Safety team began receiving reports that a disturbing and violent video had just been live-streamed in Christchurch, New Zealand. At first, our primary goal was removing the graphic video as quickly as possible, wherever users may have shared it. Although we received fewer reports about the video in the following hours, we saw an increase in reports of ‘affiliated content’. We took aggressive action to remove users glorifying the attack and impersonating the shooter; we took action on servers dedicated to dissecting the shooter’s manifesto, servers in support of the shooter’s agenda, and even memes that were made and distributed around the shooting. Our team worked around the clock to thoroughly review each report, educate users about the harm of this content, and remove any content that violated our Community Guidelines. Over the course of the first ten days after this horrific event, we received a few hundred reports about content related to the shooting and issued 1,397 account bans alongside 159 server removals for related violations. Thanks for taking the time to check out our first Trust and Safety Transparency Report for the beginning of 2019. We recognize that this may be a lot to digest and may leave you with questions, so we’d love to hear from you. We believe that transparency to users should be a norm among tech companies and provide meaningful details and insights, so people can better determine how platforms keep their users safe. We believe that sharing as much as we can will motivate other companies to do the same. The more harm we can bring out of the shadows together, the closer we are to removing harm from the Internet all together. As we mentioned, this is our first time creating a Transparency Report. Moving forward, we’ll keep iterating and improving and look to publish these reports regularly. Finally, it’s no small task to keep a platform of more than 250 million users safe for our small team, and we so appreciate every report and all the feedback we receive from our engaged community. It’s motivating to know you’re just as passionate about keeping Discord safe as we are.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "discord react memory leak", "author": ["Paul Shen"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/discord-react-memory-leak-565c89763e8", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com React is a programming model that makes it easy to build scalable and performant apps. We use React at Discord. We love React. However, back in November 2018, on a what we’ll say was a rainy day for the sake of setting a mood, we employed a seemingly routine React upgrade. This upgrade led us on an unexpected journey through our codebase, the Chrome memory inspector, and the React source code. We tried to upgrade React from 16.5 to 16.7. After we shipped the upgrade, we started getting reports of users experiencing Discord using a lot of memory — something somewhere was leaking. At that time, we briefly investigated and identified an issue with our React upgrade, which we quickly reverted. Upgrading to React 16.7 wasn’t our priority at the time; it wasn’t a huge deal for us to revert. The memory leak was no longer and Discord carried on. When React 16.8 was released with hooks, Discord engineers wanted to use those hooks. We love hooks. We really wanted this upgrade. However, we never figured out what went wrong with the failed 16.7 upgrade attempt. If the problem returned, we would start leaking again. For us to upgrade to 16.8 in good conscience, we needed to solve the memory leak. Here is where we get into the nitty gritty. Although it wasn’t always consistent, we could observe the memory leak by watching the V8 memory inspector while switching back and forth between two Discord channels. This is a route transition and causes many React components to unmount and mount. A lot of time was spent in V8’s memory inspector. Memory cannot be freed as long as any “live” object holds a reference to it. In the above screenshot, you can see the leaking memory from a channel navigation. The biggest offenders are React Fiber nodes (represented as minified Vr in the screenshot) and detached DOM elements. While we expected to find the answer at the end of the chain, it was often things like V8 internals that we didn’t understand. We tried bisecting the app by commenting out swaths of the app to see if we could isolate the issue. We upgraded legacy code and removed the use of deprecated lifecycle methods. We learned some best practices, including not referencing DOM elements directly in props and state . We audited our older dependencies like Animated and TransitionGroup . We also dug into the React source. The memory leak coincided with the introduction of React’s Fiber architecture. We observed that the memory retain graph usually consisted of long nextEffect chains and pointers from DOM nodes to Fiber nodes and vice versa. If you’re curious, this is a good article that goes in depth on the Fiber implementation. We opened a pull request which cleared the nextEffect and stateNode references on unmount. This fork mitigated but didn’t completely fix our memory issue. At one point, we discovered weird behavior with react-async-component where it seemed to re-render every nested child component on update. We fixed it by replacing it with React.lazy. We tested the change and it seemed like the memory leak was gone. We felt we could safely ship 16.8 . So we rolled out to production and started to use hooks internally. Delicious. Unfortunately for us, but thrillingly for you, the reader of this blog post, the story doesn’t end there. A few reports of memory usage started trickling in again after the upgrade. Although harder to reproduce, we were convinced the memory issue was still alive after our fix. Discord using a lot of memory is unacceptable. The last thing we want is Discord causing a frame rate drop. We needed to find a fix immediately or roll back the React 16.8 upgrade. We had started using hooks so we wanted to avoid rolling back if possible, but couldn’t let this upgrade continue to hurt users. At Discord, we employ a number of principles to solve problems. One is timeboxing — allocating a fixed amount of time for an activity. Although the React upgrade started as a simple task, it turned into one of unknown scope and energy. Timeboxing is a great risk management tool. Curiosity was a driving motivator in this investigation. Timeboxing serves as a counterbalance and avoids following a hard problem down the rabbit hole. Or growing leaking memory hole. Whatever image serves you best. We were near the end of our timebox. Continuing to poke around the codebase and upgrading components were unlikely to solve the problem. Instead, we revisited our React fork and added a patch to clear the DOM-to-fiber references on unmount. This is most definitely a hack but it seemed to fix the memory leak. Phew. We tested more thoroughly and asked some of the most active Discord Bug Hunters to go gangbusters on a custom build. The before-and-after was obvious. While we would love to continue the investigation, we had to move on. Finding the root cause of the memory leak continues to be an unbounded activity. A forked React, although not perfect, allows us to stay on 16.8, use hooks, and not compromise Discord’s performance. The React team has been responsive in addressing these issues. Although there are a number of people reporting React memory issues, many have been unable to identify the root issue and create isolated repros. Sebastian from the React core team has opened an umbrella Github issue to track memory problems. A little later, we were able to create a sandbox repro for leaking effect pointers. We’re happy to say that a portion of our fork ( clearing nextEffect pointers ) has made it upstream and should be a part of the React 16.9 release. The other changes require more investigation. Some findings we found include: It is best practice not to reference DOM nodes and React instances in props or state. Use a container (e.g. ref) instead. Here is a repro of the issue: https://codesandbox.io/s/compassionate-fermat-3cq5b It’s important to fix leaks however small as they can potentially cascade with the current React Fiber implementation. Here is an example leak we found and fixed in react-dnd. Although not specific to React, we observed that video elements were being leaked in Chrome. We solved this by wrapping all video elements in a custom component. We should be able to remove this soon as a fix is in Chromium master. We still don’t know exactly why we experienced memory leaks — we’ll hopefully answer that another day. With our fork, we’re confident that React will not cause the memory leaks we saw. Discord will keep performing as it should and we get to keep using hooks ❤ Imagine a Place 1.2K 7 Thanks to Michael Peterson and Amadeus Demarzi .

{"website": "Discord", "title": "using rust to scale elixir for 11 million concurrent users", "author": ["Matt Nowack"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/using-rust-to-scale-elixir-for-11-million-concurrent-users-c6f19fc029d3", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Over the last year, the Backend Infrastructure team at Discord was hard at work improving the scalability and performance of our core real-time communications infrastructure. One big project we undertook was changing how we update the Member List (all those nifty people on the right side of the screen). Instead of sending updates for every single person in the Member List, we could just send down the updates for the visible portion of the Member List. This has obvious benefits such as less network traffic, less CPU usage, better battery life; the list goes on and on. However, this posed one big problem on the server side: We needed a data structure capable of holding hundreds of thousands of entries, sorted in a particular way that can accept and process tons of mutations, and can report back indices of where things are being added and removed. Elixir is a functional language; its data structures are immutable. This is great for reasoning about code and supporting the massive concurrency you enjoy when you write Elixir. The double-edged sword of immutable data structures is that mutations are modeled by taking an existing data structure and an operation and creating a brand new data structure that is the result of applying that operation to the existing data structure. This meant that when someone joined a server — internally referred to as guilds — with a Member List of 100,000 members, we would have to build a new list with 100,001 members in it. The BEAM VM is pretty speedy and getting faster everyday . It tries to take advantage of persistent data structures where it can, but at the scale we operate, these large lists could not be updated fast enough. Two engineers took up the challenge of making a pure Elixir data structure that could hold large sorted sets and support fast mutation operations. This is easier said than done, so let’s put on our Computer Science helmets and go spelunking into the caves of data structure design. Elixir ships with a set implementation called MapSet. MapSet is a general purpose data structure built on top of the Map data structure. It’s useful for lots of Set operations, but it provides no guarantees around ordering, which is a key requirement for the Member List. This pretty much ruled out MapSet as a contender. Next up would be the venerable List type: wrap the List with a helper that would enforce uniqueness and sort the list after insertion of new elements. A quick benchmark of this approach shows that for small lists — 5,000 elements— insertion time was measured between 500𝜇s and 3,000𝜇s. This was already far too slow to be viable. Even worse, the performance of insertion scaled with size of list and depth of position in the list. Worst case that was benchmarked was adding a new element to the end of a 250,000 item list, which came in around 170,000𝜇s: basically an eternity. Two down, but BEAM isn’t out of the competition yet. Erlang ships with a module called ordsets. Ordsets are Ordered Sets, so sounds like we found the solution to our problem: Let’s break out the benchmarking to check for viability. When the list is small the performance looks pretty great measuring between 0.008𝜇s and 288𝜇s. Sadly, when the size tested was increased to 250,000 worst-case performance increased to 27,000𝜇s, which was five times faster than our custom List implementation but still not fast enough. Having exhausted all the obvious candidates that come with the language, a cursory search of packages was done to see if someone else had already solved and open sourced the solution to this problem. A few packages were checked, but none of them provided the properties and performance required. Thankfully, the field of Computer Science has been optimizing algorithms and data structures for storing and sorting data for the last 60 years, so there were plenty of ideas about how to proceed. The ordsets perform extremely well at small sizes. Maybe there was some way that we could chain a bunch of very small ordsets together and quickly access the correct one when accessing a particular position. If you turn your head sideways and squint real hard, this starts to look like a Skip List , which is exactly what was implemented. The first incarnation of this new data structure was pretty straightforward. The OrderedSet was a wrapper around a list of Cells, inside each cell was a small ordset: the first item of the ordset, the last item of the ordset, and a count of the number of items. This allowed the OrderedSet to quickly traverse the list of Cells to find the appropriate Cell and then do a very fast ordset operation. By leveraging compile time guards in the implementation of traversal, you can get pretty good performance in the worst case scenarios that stymie ordset. Insertion of an item at the end of a 250,000 item list dropped from 27,000𝜇s to 5,000𝜇s, five times faster than raw ordsets and 34 times faster than the naive List implementation. So pop the champagne corks and celebrate, right? Not quite. The old worst case was better, but a new worst case of insertion at the beginning of the list had been created; a 250,000 item list was clocking in at 19,000𝜇s. Wat?! This makes sense if you think about the data structure. When you insert an item into the front of the OrderedSet it ends up in the first Cell, but that Cell is full, so it evicts its last item to the next Cell, but that Cell is full, so it evicts its last item to the next Cell, and so on. At this point, most engineers would shrug and say “You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” but at Discord we are pushing the envelope on quantum cake technology. The problem is that when things fill up, operations can cascade from Cell to Cell. What if we could do something more clever? What if we allow Cells to swell and split, dynamically inserting new Cells in the middle of the list? This is slightly more expensive, but has the benefit that the worst case is a Cell Split instead of 2N Cell operations, where N is the number of Cells. Another day of coding data structures and we were ready to benchmark. At small list sizes, this new dynamic OrderedSet could perform insertions at any point in the list between 4𝜇s and 34𝜇s. Not bad. The real test came when we cranked up the size to 250,000. Inserting at the beginning of the list took…. drumroll…. 4𝜇s. That’s looking fast. But remember last time we made one number fast, we made another slow. Maybe the end of the list is horrible now, better check. With a list size of 250,000 items, inserting an item at the end of the list took 640𝜇s. Looks like we have a winner. This solution would work for guilds up to 250,000 members, but that was the scaling limit. For a lot of people, this would have been the end of the story. But Discord has been using Rust to make things go fast, and we posed a question: “Could we use Rust to go faster?” Rust is not a functional language, and will happily let you mutate data structures. It also has no run-time and provides “zero-cost abstractions.” If we could somehow get Rust to manage this set, it would probably perform much better. Our core services aren’t written in Rust, they are Elixir-based. Elixir serves this purpose very well, and lucky for us, the BEAM VM had another nifty trick up its sleeve. The BEAM VM has three types of functions: Functions that are written in Erlang or Elixir. These are simple user-space functions. Functions that are built into the language and act as the building blocks for user-space functions. These are called BIFs or Built-In Functions. Then there are NIFs or Native Implemented Functions. These are functions that are built in C or Rust and compiled into the BEAM VM. Calling these functions is just like calling a BIF but, you can control what it does. There’s a fantastic Elixir project called Rustler . It provides nice support on the Elixir and Rust side for making a safe NIF that is well behaved and using the guarantees of Rust is guaranteed not to crash the VM or leak memory. We set aside a week to see if this would be worth the effort. By the end of the week, we had a very limited proof-of-concept that we could measure. The first benchmarks were extremely promising. The best case for adding an item to the set was 0.4𝜇s with a worst case of 2.85𝜇s, compared to OrderedSet’s 4𝜇s to 640𝜇s. This was a benchmark just using integers, but it was enough evidence to build out support for a wider range of Erlang Terms and fill out the rest of the functionality. With the spike showing so much promise, we continued on building out support for most Erlang Terms and all the functionality we needed for the member list. It was time to benchmark again. We cranked the number of items all the way up to 1,000,000 items. The test machine churned for a few minutes and finally printed out the result: SortedSet best case was 0.61𝜇s and worst case was 3.68𝜇s, testing multiple sizes of sets from 5,000 to 1,000,000 items. For the second iteration in a row we were able to make the worst case as good as the previous iterations best-case timings. The Rust backed NIF provides massive performance benefits without trading off ease of use or memory. Since the library operations all clocked in well under the 1 millisecond threshold, we could just use the built-in Rustler guarantees and not need to worry about reductions or yielding. The SortedSet module looks to the caller to just be a vanilla Elixir module that performs crazy fast. Today, the Rust backed SortedSet powers every single Discord guild: from the 3 person guild planning a trip to Japan to 200,000 people enjoying the latest, fun game. Since deploying SortedSet, we’ve seen performance improve across the board with no impact to memory pressure. We learned that Rust and Elixir can work side by side to operate in extremely tight performance constraints. We can still keep our core real-time communications logic in the higher-level Elixir with its wonderful guarantees and easy concurrency while dropping down into Rust when needed. If you need a high-speed mutation friendly SortedSet, we have released SortedSet as an open source library .

{"website": "Discord", "title": "empowering developers with community and commerce", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/empowering-developers-with-community-and-commerce-68d9c0712662", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com After we upsorbed the Discord Game Store into your computer chat program, we received a lot of feedback and learnings about what players and developers really want. We’ve learned so much that we’re evolving in a big big way. Super glue yourself in because we’re shakin’ this timeline up. One major thing reinforced during our store beta is how much developers like building communities on Discord, and how much players like hanging out in Verified Servers. We know that building and engaging a community of superfans on Discord is becoming more and more important to a game’s success. Furthermore, we’ve learned that developers want more agency over their monetization and less friction between their community and their commerce. To better serve the needs of both players and developers, we’re evolving Verified Servers to include enhanced community options and commerce tools. Starting now, we’re mixing in some tapioca starch and thickening up Verified Servers for devs in a big way. For a small development fee, devs will have access to store channels and news channels. Once approved, they’ll receive a verified checkmark, get vanity perks, and appear in server discovery. We’ve learned that devs want to avoid the friction and cost of a traditional storefront by selling directly to their community. So, you can now create a store channel within your server where anyone can get your game. Moreover, we’ve learned that devs want better insights for their games. These insights allows devs to optimize their game development, marketing campaigns, and community activations which ultimately makes better game experiences for players. So, some analytics are already live and some are coming soon for devs making use of our commerce tools. Use these insights to understand how much salt you need to add to your gamezpacho. Sign up for our dev newsletter to stay up to date on this. Moremoreover, we’ve learned that devs want more ways to engage with their community. Sooo, tidy up your menu items because you can now designate any channel a news channel (like #announcements) and share updates to your players’ Activity Feed. GLOSSARY MOMENT: The Activity Feed is Discord’s “homepage.” As a player, it shows news for games you play, what your friends have been up to, and who’s playing games right now in case you wanna join in! More specifically, you can elect to push any post containing a link to the Activity Feed of all Discord users who play your game, not just to the people in your server. To clarify, this news only reaches people who are engaged with your server/game. Another big brain thing we’ve learned is that devs are using Discord to run early tests of their games to small audiences. These alpha and beta groups then turn into the foundation of healthy communities that are hyped about a game and geared up to purchase on launch day. Soooo, leverage our existing permission features and store channels to manage your game through its entire lifecycle inside Discord. Here’s an example timeline of what you can do: Closed Alpha and Beta — invite specific users to your server and grant store channel access via server roles for testing. Open Beta — build a wider community of early adopters and evangelists. Early Access — sell your game during late-stage development to superfans. Launch — in-server commerce allows you to sell directly to fans where they hang out at a 90/10 rev split. Post-Launch — sell your IAP/DLC in your server and keep your commerce and fans all in one place during long-tail development. Lunch — get down on a panini ya weenie 🍔 As said earlier, we know that building and engaging a community of super-fans on Discord is becoming more and more vital to a games success. Take advantage of features that let you elevate your community engagement to new heights. Once approved, you’ll have access to: Verified Server Cosmetics — make a memorable server name like discord.gg/mysickgame and upload some awesome art to make your server stand out like a really tall person amongst people who are less than the height of the really tall person. Server Discovery — your server will be discoverable to Discord’s 250 million registered players within the server discovery directory. It’s like a treasure hunt except you’re the beautiful shiny treasure. Gifting — leverage our gifting system and let your fans drop click-to-redeem gift links across the world wide webwork. Finally final, we know that building games is time consuming. Soooooo, log into GitHub because our engineers built a lot of cool tools to make devs’ lives easier. Use our SDK to save time and power your games. Examples of this are below and check this cool other thing with words to learn more about these words below. Networking and lobbies Voice chat. Hey, Discord is pretty good at that (works on any platform as long as Discord is running). Couponing system and price control Cloud Saves Rich Presence — let players show off their game status with rich information about what character they’re playing as, what level they’re in, or how much match time has elapsed (among other things. The world is your okonomiyaki). You can get started on many of these things without needing us to verify or approve. Head over to the Discord Dev Portal to start. After paying the development fee, you’ll get immediate access to pre-launch lifecycle tools. You can also begin integrating our SDK for Rich Presence and more. Then, you’ll see a required checklist to complete prior to submitting for approval. Once you submit, our team will review your server, your game, and your store pages. After being verified, you’ll have access to our commerce tools. Sell your game, allow gifting, see analytics, and surface in Server Discovery! With game commerce shifting to communities, we’ve decided to replace the store tab with our Nitro games catalogue. For players, finding and buying games now happens through servers. Your library remains untouched by these changes. We’re really super excited to open the gates, release our tools, and enable devs to control their own destiny in the same way they control building their communities.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "redesigning the discord overlay", "author": ["Daniel Destefanis"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/redesigning-the-discord-overlay-cc31c6042d6d", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com You’re waiting for your multiplayer match to start, or maybe you’re entering the boss room when you hear the Discord notification sound. Now you’re faced with choices: You could ignore the notification, which the enticing *bloo-bloop* makes impossible , stop everything you’re doing and go buy a second monitor, or spend several seconds alt-tabbing to Discord to read it, and then several seconds alt-tabbing back into your game. Regardless of what you choose, this isn’t an enjoyable experience and it’s one of many problems we solve in our Discord overlay redesign. For those unfamiliar with in-game overlays, they’re a “layer” of features — usually chat, a friends list, etc. — that can be accessed without needing to alt-tab and losing focus of a game. Overlays are usually accessed via a hotkey (our default hotkey is shift +~ ) while a game is running. The original overlay we released in 2016 was designed around voice activity. If you and your friends were in a Discord voice channel, the overlay would display you and your friend’s avatars in-game. This feature worked well for switching voice channels, seeing who was talking, or knowing which of your friends left their microphone unmuted ( I’m looking at you, Siegfried) . While this focus on voice features was useful, we wanted to make the overlay useable for Discord’s other core features. The Discord design team’s process generally follows the double diamond method . This process can be broken down into four phases: discover, define, develop, and deliver. In order to define what a valuable overlay experience might look like, we set aside additional time for discovery during our design process. During this period, we interviewed both overlay and non-overlay users. We read through our feedback board , played games with our existing overlay, camped in the woods for three days, and spent time brainstorming ideas to bring to our discovery meetings. During this discovery period, we learned a lot about ourselves, our hopes, dreams, and fears. Figured some stuff out about the overlay too: We should provide benefits to users for every type of game. This includes single player, multiplayer, or massively multiplayer. Performance of the overlay is a critical part of the experience . If the overlay drops a game’s performance, isn’t reliable, or doesn’t resemble the desktop app, then users won’t want to use it. And who could blame them? Use existing design language wherever it makes sense. If we have an existing design component or familiar flow from the desktop app we should leverage it as long as there isn’t a better contextual replacement. Text chat within the overlay is something everyone wants . It provides the opportunity to improve engagement, match the desktop experience more closely, and lets us introduce new features unique to the overlay. Camping is a bad place to realize you’re afraid of the dark. Not all self-discovery is good. Reduce friction for main use cases. The actions the majority of our users will be utilizing the overlay for should be simple, familiar, and obvious. These actions include join voice channel, respond to a direct message, and accept an invite. Provide an experience that mimics the joy of using the desktop app. We should aim to include all of the quality of life and fun features of the desktop app whenever possible. It shouldn’t feel like a different product. More like we grew a third arm and we give amazing hugs now. Our projects at Discord start with a product spec. This document describes what we’re building, who we’re building it for, and the outcome we want to achieve. This process is collaborative, the entire product team — both engineering and design — can weigh in on all aspects of the project. In the case of our overlay redesign, our discovery phase helped further define the product spec. We updated the spec, reprioritized features, and set scope so the team was aligned before starting development. Before opening up a design program we started sketching and whiteboarding ideas. The sketches are quick and fairly rough so instead of sharing those, I’ll share the designs that were created from those sketches. Overlays have two states: active and inactive. While active, the overlay interface is on top of the game and the features are made available. This should not prevent the user from seeing their game. Being able to follow what’s happening in case they need to switch back to playing is important to the experience. One design decision that we made early on was the transparent color layer that would appear when the overlay was active. This layer provided contrast against the game making the UI easier to see and the inactive/active states more distinct. When the overlay is inactive, the user just sees the game they’re playing. In the earliest designs, we explored how text chat could work without copying the client directly. I found myself gravitating back towards the app’s convention of servers stacked vertically. Horizontally displaying recent conversations was far too limiting and felt like change for the sake of change. As we explored alternative designs for text chat we quickly realized the benefits of leveraging our existing conventions. By borrowing from our desktop app, we could avoid having to reeducate users and could reduce cognitive load. Game interfaces come in all shapes and sizes and the features of the overlay needed to accommodate this. This meant the user needs full control of the size and placement of both voice and text features. With the addition of text chat within the overlay, we realized not all overlay users would need to see voice activity, which was the only functionality it provided previously. From this realization came the idea of widgets. Widgets were windowed features that could be moved around, resized, shown in game, or hidden from view. The thinking behind this system was to give the user control of positioning, while also encapsulating all the settings and controls of the feature within the widget. Early on we had a widget design for every piece of the overlay. We performed several sessions of user testing to help refine the widget designs and interactions. Through user feedback, we were able to simplify flows, improve widget controls, and create a solid design system for the future of the product. Most AAA games have custom cursors for their titles. This problem informed the design of our widgets. This meant the user wouldn’t see traditional cursor changes that would signify something was draggable or resizable. Instead, we needed to present these actions with icons, tooltips, and give the icons a hover state in order to feedback to the user. As I mentioned previously, hearing a notification but not knowing who or what was being sent was not an enjoyable experience. The way we solved this problem was with in-game notifications. Notifications are something that all games benefit from. Playing a single player game and receive a direct message? We show you a preview in-game so you can decide to respond. Or ignore it. Probably ignore (sorry Siegfried). The notification system design was based on our message component. The design consists of an avatar, a title, and a message. At a glance, you can immediately recognize the sender and enough text to provide context. We also use our notification system to display updates to the overlay, sort of like a tiny change log. In order to reuse the component, we change the background color and replace the message content with a footer that can also house controls or the hotkey shortcut reminder. To give users more control of the interface, we created settings for in-game notification placement and the option to disable them entirely. Discord’s goal is to bring people together around games. So, while we all love to be immersed in a game from time to time, there’s also plenty of instances where you want to still be involved with your server while gaming. In order to address this issue, we came up with the concept of pinning . Pinning is when the user wants to display that widget in their game. With pinning, users could make any game a social one. Whether users were completing daily quests in World of Warcraft, or playing a rogue-like to kill time, now they could do so while still interacting with their server. Pinning widgets provided a consistent way of showing, or hiding, voice and text activity. Once we released the redesign and enabled more games to use in our overlay we saw a 50% increase in overlay users. Of that group, 30% use text and notification features. More importantly, the redesign gave our team a solid foundation to keep building upon. So while the release was a great first step to improving our overlay experience, it also gives us room to improve in the future! It’s hard to articulate how important collaboration and teamwork was in order for this project to be successful. I’d like to say thank you to everyone here at Discord who contributed to building the overlay. We’re always looking for the next great addition to our product team at Discord.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "maintaining trust and safety at discord with over 200 million people", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/maintaining-trust-and-safety-at-discord-with-over-200-million-people-f0b39adfc00c", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Almost four years ago, we started Discord to bring people together around games. Fast forward to today, over 200 million people have used Discord to do just that. While our goals are focused on bringing people together around games, people also use Discord to talk about their open source projects, their favorite bands, tv shows, and more. Moreover, with all this growth comes some people doing bad things on Discord, which we don’t want in our community. Two years ago, we began building a team focused on keeping our community safe on Discord (and since then, the Trust and Safety team has grown tremendously). Keeping you safe means making sure real-world harm doesn’t come to you, and no matter who you are, you don’t feel like someone else is intimidating you or harassing you away from being able to participate on Discord. There’s been a lot of chatter recently from our community wondering how decisions are made on Trust and Safety at Discord. Let’s pull back the curtain and give you a look behind the scenes. Our Trust and Safety Team currently reviews more than 800 reports every day for violations of our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, in total handling more than 6,000 reports a week. Those reports vary greatly: sometimes the team may be investigating server raids and NSFW avatars; other times it’s removing deeply disturbing content like gore videos or revenge pornography. We also get reports where a person demands we ban another person for “calling them a poopyhead,” while other times someone is being doxxed or in danger of self-harm and a friend of theirs reaches out to us. Further complicating things, we also get reports from people who use a combination of false information, edited screenshots, socially engineered situations, or mass reports in an attempt to get a person banned or server deleted. We don’t act without clear evidence, and we gather as much information as possible to make informed, evidence-based decisions that take into account the context behind anything that’s posted. We’ll talk about some of the hard decisions we face later in this blog. Answering user requests is usually our highest priority, and something that we do seven days a week. But it’s only part of the job. The Trust and Safety team also works with our engineering team to identify and proactively address potential harm before it ever gets on Discord (like making sure that you don’t get spammed just because you’ve joined a large server). We also work with local and international agencies on law enforcement requests, many which involve life and death situations. Moreover, we spend a significant amount of time evaluating our policies within the Trust and Safety team, the company as a whole, and talking through potential changes with trusted NGOs to ensure our policies are fair. That said, no system is perfect. Even if we’re 99.9% confident in the decisions we make, it means that we’ll mess up on 6 requests out of the 6000 every week. To make sure that we get as close to perfection as possible, most actions are reviewed by more than one person. We’re constantly reviewing our work so that we correct and learn from our mistakes and reduce that number even further. Ultimately, nearly all of the work is done behind the scenes and the majority of people never make a report to Trust and Safety. Unlike many other parts of Discord where success is launching a feature and having millions of people celebrate it, success for Trust and Safety is having fewer people encounter a bad situation on Discord. In many situations, what happened is pretty obvious — a person has raided a server to post shock or gore content, they’re posting someone’s private information, or they’re directly threatening to harm someone in real life. There are other cases where the situation is not so simple. Sometimes, parts of a conversation have been deleted, a slur is used as an act of reclamation, or someone is distributing a hack to a game on Discord that is generally used for cosmetic purposes — but could be used to cheat under certain conditions. The Trust and Safety team seeks out context to best evaluate what’s going on even when things seem ambiguous. To illustrate the complexity of Trust and Safety’s decision making, see the three scenarios below and the accompanying considerations. Two people report each other for bad behavior. One of them clearly started the harassment, while the other escalated it. It starts out with simple insults, but they’re not willing to block each other. Eventually, it escalates to where one threatens to shoot the other’s dog and the other responds by making a sexual threat towards the initial person’s boyfriend. Meanwhile, they’re doing this in a channel that has plenty of other people in it, some of whom are clearly uncomfortable with the escalation, and one of those bystanders in the server writes in too, asking us to do something about it. Finally, not only is the owner of the server not doing anything, they’re actually egging the two people on, further escalating the situation. Who should we take action on? Is it the person that started it? The person that escalated to a threat first? Or is it both people, even though each believes the other is at fault? Both people could’ve solved it by blocking the other — should we take any action at all? How much do we believe each person felt threatened by the other person and thought the only reasonable thing to do was to keep engaging? Should we also take action on the server owner in some way for egging them on instead of defusing the situation? If we do take action on the server owner, what should it be? A warning? What if one of the server members reports that the owner was privately messaging the two people in order to keep the feud going? Should we punish the server owner instead of the two people? Someone is banned for messaging people across servers a combination of racial slurs and spam. This person contacts us to appeal their ban. First, we inform them of the specific Community Guideline they have violated. Then, the banned person asks which specific message led to the ban. They insist they’ve done nothing wrong and never violated the Community Guidelines. They claim they’ve been an upstanding citizen, are in twenty different Discord servers, and have a host of users that can speak on their behalf. They insist it’s a false ban based on false reporting. Finally, they enlist some of those people to write in and tell us that the person was maliciously reported. They demand we overturn the ban immediately. Is the banned person acting in good faith? Do they legitimately not understand how they violated our Community Guidelines? Are they simply trying to identify the reporter? Should we provide vague information? Will the banned person continue arguing that whatever messages we have are insufficient? How do we respond to the supporters that are writing in about this ban? How much information should they get about the situation? Someone worriedly reaches out to us about a DM they received from another person claiming to be Discord staff. The DM is a warning that their messages are being monitored and that if they continued, the authorities will be contacted. They ask us if the message is real. While the DM isn’t from Discord, the person pretending to be Discord staff contacts us and admits to sending those messages from an alt. The impersonator claims they lied in order to dissuade the initial person from self-harming. When we investigate, it does appear to be true. The initial person was talking about some harmful activity and after receiving the impersonated warning, they’ve completely stopped. Impersonating Discord staff is a violation of our Community Guidelines. Most of the time, impersonators engage in extremely harmful behavior and will receive an immediate ban. In this case, it appears the impersonator has good intentions. Should we take action on the impersonator? Do we just warn them not to do it again? Do we just let it go? On the other side, should we confirm with the initial person that the message was not from Discord? If we do that, does this encourage them to continue to self-harm? All of this is a lot to consider and Discord’s Trust and Safety Team is tasked with answering questions like these hundreds of times a day, seven days a week, with each situation different and each one with real people who will be impacted by what we choose to do. When creating new policy, we evaluate all available information on that topic to understand what the best policy is. We look at academic research on the topic, what other companies do, and what users, non-users, and experts in the field think. We consider whether something is illegal, whether something is harmful, and how scalable our operations are. We leverage all of these checks and balances to remove as much personal bias or interest as possible. We believe we have a deep-seated responsibility to be objective about what we allow or restrict on Discord. Our decision-making process prioritizes safety from harm. We strive to create a platform that is safe and inclusive, regardless of someone’s race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, religion, and sexual orientation. After all, everyone can play and enjoy games, and Discord should be that place where anyone can find someone else to play with. Along with thinking about how we can prevent harm to people on Discord, we consider scale, privacy, nuance, and freedom when developing policy. How can we scale the enforcement of this policy to our enormous user base? A policy that sounds good but isn’t enforced isn’t actually good policy. It’s important not just to talk the talk but to also walk the walk. How can we balance our ability to investigate potential bad things on Discord while our users have and should have a right to privacy? In the real world, Big Brother isn’t watching you inside your home during a conversation with two of your friends, even if you’re up to no good. Should we keep using that model on Discord if it means that people have the ability to chat about bad things, and that Discord may be used for bad actions? Are people okay with automated software or other humans reading their private conversations to stop potential bad actors? If a potential harm is very hard to discern, is it Discord’s place as a platform to moderate a particular form of speech? If something is reported frequently and we can’t conclude whether it’s definitely bad (even though users can take some action to protect themselves), should we rely on them to do so? If someone opens up a server and promises rewards to its members, but people complain that they’re not fulfilling those assurances, should we forbid offering rewards? With all this said, how can we make sure that good people don’t feel like we’re censoring them? Just because we don’t understand a hobby or interest, does that give us the permission to ban it from our platform? After considering scale, privacy, nuance, and freedom, we outline all possible outcomes to the best of our ability, and try to find the solution with the best possible answers to those questions. Eventually, after thorough discussion, research, and talking to third parties, we make our way to a policy document. To get more perspective, we circulate that document to other Discord staff members who aren’t on Trust and Safety and ask for their feedback. Finally, we arrive at a conclusion, implement the policy, and monitor it. If we receive new information or the policy isn’t having the impact we’d hoped, we adjust our policy to make sure that it’s effective. We’re constantly listening, observing, and wanting to do better, and our policy reflects this as a living, breathing, work in progress. On that note, we wanted to talk about a recent change we’ve made to uphold our commitment to listening to community feedback. Over the past couple of weeks, posts have appeared inquiring about Discord’s stance on a niche area of NSFW policy, which is cub porn. A screenshot of an email we sent about a year ago in February 2018 has garnered significant commentary and criticism about our policy. As our Community Guidelines state, the following immediately results in account deletion: Sharing content related to minors that is sexually suggestive or violent. Do not share or post links to images that depict minors or underage individuals engaged in violent, sexually suggestive, pornographic, shameful, or otherwise inappropriate situations. Furthermore, the following will lead to content removal and a warning (or ban depending on the severity): Sharing illustrated or digitally altered pornography which depicts minors (such as lolicon or shotacon). One major reason this policy is in place on Discord is because there is a federal law in the United States against the sexualized images of minors, which includes cartoons and drawings . You can see this distinction in action on Google Images which does not show results for lolicon but does show results for cub porn. Discord’s current policy is that anything human or humanoid is forbidden (including anthropomorphized characters). This includes most cub pornography. While this is already more restrictive than what the law requires, we’ve received feedback that we’re not comprehensive enough here. As of today, we’re changing our policy to ban all cub porn. This means the sexualization of minor ban now extends to non-humanoid animals and mythological creatures as long as they appear to be underage. We’re adding “cub” to the list of categories, after lolicon and shotacon, to our Community Guidelines to clarify that this content is not allowed on Discord. It’s really important to us that the millions of people who use Discord every day can trust our decisions. We want this blog to provide transparency on our processes, and we’re going to continue this by further providing a more in-depth view into our actions as a team with Discord’s first transparency report. In this report, we want to provide more information about our content moderation outcomes, such as how many actions are taken a month, how many users are actioned, and what is causing their removal from the platform. We think that transparency is good. It will shine more light on the work we do, help maintain accountability, and guide conversations about where we should be spending our time to get better. We’re looking to release our first report by the end of April, and want to continue releasing them quarterly after that. These last couple of weeks, we received a lot of feedback about our policies and decisions. We’ve also received death threats and personal attacks directed at those who put their heart and soul into keeping you all safe on Discord. As time goes on and Discord grows even larger, there will likely be more situations where reasonable people may disagree on the best policy to have. When this happens, we hope to engage in constructive dialogue, not personal attacks or threats. Lastly, we’ve always taken feedback on all of our decisions, from what features to build all the way to the policies that govern what is acceptable conduct on Discord. We hope this blog shows you how our Trust and Safety team keeps Discord a safe place to bring people together around games. We look forward to continuing this dialogue with you.

By looping the community in early and asking for feedback, they’re able to create something that resonates much more strongly with players. As players ourselves, we’re stoked at the chance to provide feedback and shape the game experiences we love. Chatting directly with devs in their verified servers and helping guide the game towards what we want to play is, well, SICK. This is why we’re launching Discord Early Access. Now, devs can release their games as early access and players like you can support them during their development. Help create some awesome game experiences! Mike Rose, Director at No More Robots, publisher of Descenders (one of our early access titles), emphasizes why early access is so important: Without opportunities like early access, Descenders would not have been made. It’s that simple. Giving our community a way to get involved through feedback and funding gives us what we need to steer our game’s development in the direction that players want. That’s huge. Our community is incredibly important to us and we are making games for them, so involving them in the process is a no-brainer. Check out the first wave of Discord Early Access games (including Descenders) below and join the verified servers to chat directly with the devs, the community, and help steer the development of these games. If you’re a developer and wondering how you can leverage your community on Discord to support your game, start here with Mike’s guest blog.

Check out the store here! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In this blog, we’re gonna recap everything that we’ve announced about our store beta so far. This includes: Our curated store which makes it easier to find good games. First on Discord games which makes it easier to find good games because these games are good. The evolved Nitro. Because now, it has games! The Universal Library so you don’t have to deal with multiple game launchers. We’ve slaved over hot stoves. We’ve travelled the world. We’ve explored sunken ships, and we’ve returned with something we think you’ll love. We want to make it easier for you to find games to play with your friends. Our curated selection, editorialized content, and surfacing of social information should help you figure out which games are right for you. No need to browse endless lists of anime titles — we make it easy to find something great to play. For more information about the store, check it out on the store tab (shown below) or read our support article here. Again, we literally travelled the world to find great games and bring them to you (Sweden is sick)! These games will launch First on Discord (lovingly referred at Discord HQ as FOD), which means they’re exclusive on PC to Discord for usually 90 days. FOD games may also launch on console during this time. Wanna dig deep? Check this blog out for full trailers and game descriptions. Discord Nitro now includes a growing library of critically acclaimed games that we think you and your friends should play. Subscribing to Nitro now costs $9.99 a month. As of today, there’s over 60 curated games for you to download and play at a total value of over $1000. We are going to add games at a regular cadence to keep the Nitro library fresh and growing. Games may sometimes leave the Nitro selection (due to our contracts with the developers/publishers expiring without renewal). With our cloud saves, your save data will remain even if games rotate out of our library. We also want an option for those looking to support us but don’t want games. Enter, Nitro Classic. At $4.99/mo, get access to a slew of chat perks like animated avatars, ability to choose your tag (the #0000 next to your username), higher quality screen share, custom emoji anywhere, animated emoji, larger file upload limit (50mb from 8mb), and a badge to show how long you’ve been supporting us.

Read our recent Nitro blog for details . For more information about Nitro and Nitro Classic, check out our support article here. We’re gamers. We know how it can be frustrating to have many clients for all the games you own. So, we wanted to not only make game discovery and purchasing better, but we wanted to make owning and managing your library easier as well. Enter our Universal Library. If you want, Discord can scan your computer for games. Then, you’ll be able to launch any of your games through Discord even if they require another launcher (Discord will boot the other launcher and game). This way, you don’t have to worry about which game boots from where! This global beta launch is a major moment, but it’s the first of many towards making the best experience possible for all of you. We look forward to taking this journey with you. Thank you so much for your support. The world is our oyster, and we look forward to slurping it down with you.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "terms of service feedback and changes", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/terms-of-service-feedback-and-changes-c58a530c7693", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com We’ve received a lot of feedback about our recent Terms of Service update. As always, community feedback is incredibly important to us, so thank you for voicing your opinions. We do appreciate it. First, we want to provide some context around these changes. Then, we’ll share how we’ve changed some things based on your feedback. On October 16th, 2018, we added an arbitration and class action waiver clause. To summarize, this clause states that when there’s a disagreement between Discord and you, we’ll use an alternative dispute resolution process known as arbitration. The current legal landscape in the United States is such that class action lawsuits can be abused. This clause was added because we are now operating a game store and subscription service for profit. Like many other companies, we are now a target for entities who wish to abuse the class action lawsuit. If you’d like to learn more about the legal landscape, arbitration, and the potential abuse of class action lawsuits, we’ve included a handful of links in the Resources section at the bottom of this post. We think that people can disagree on whether or not arbitration is good in general or whether or not the class action system is one that is beneficial; we don’t think it’s completely black and white. In fact, we’re very interested in how Europe is approaching implementing class action lawsuits , as their approach may mitigate the issues that the United States faces with them. Because we don’t think it’s black and white, one of the things that we’ve implemented (which some of our competitors do not), is to allow you to opt out of this clause completely. We encourage you to opt out if you wish. You won’t be penalized in any way if you do so . At no point will we ever gate any features or take any action on users because they’ve opted out of arbitration. The following changes will be live sometime before October 20th, 2018. As we stated above in “Why did we change it,” our motivation for this change is because of the legal climate in the United States. To protect our users outside the United States, we’ve decided to modify this clause so that it only affects users in the United States. If you are outside of the United States, this clause does not apply to you. This means users outside the United States do not need to opt out if they were wanting to. Furthermore, every user was (or will be if they haven’t logged in yet) notified of changes to our Terms of Service on the date they were updated by a blue notification bar at the top of the Discord client. In hindsight, we should have provided notice of these changes much further in advance, so we apologize for that. That said, much of the feedback we’ve received is that our community was not aware of these changes. To provide more opportunity for those who wish to opt out and for those who may have overlooked the notification bar, we’ve extended our opt out period from the initial 30 days to 90 days. Stated in our Terms of Service under DISPUTE RESOLUTION: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com . Your opt out doesn’t need any specific template or form. It just needs the request to opt out and it must come from the email associated with your Discord account. We want to reiterate — you will not be penalized in any way for opting out of arbitration. Again, we encourage you to do so if you wish to. Thanks again for your feedback — it’s important to us as a company that we hear from our community. We really appreciate that you all care so much to voice your opinions. If you have any further questions, please send an email to privacy@discordapp.com and we’ll be happy to answer! A quick primer on arbitration from the California courts’ official website. Wikipedia on Class Action lawsuits. We recommended reading the sections on Advantages and Criticisms An article detailing how one can abuse class action lawsuits by Mike Masnick (a notable proponent of user rights). As a counter point, here’s another article by Mike detailing how arbitration is not much better. We linked this earlier in the post, but repeating here . An article about how the EU may implement class action lawsuits to avoid abuse.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord handles two and half million concurrent voice users using webrtc", "author": ["Jozsef Vass"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-handles-two-and-half-million-concurrent-voice-users-using-webrtc-ce01c3187429", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com From the very start, we made very conscious engineering and product decisions to keep Discord well suited for voice chat while playing your favorite game with your friends. These decisions enabled us to massively scale our operation with a small team and limited resources. This post gives a brief overview of the different technologies Discord uses to make audio/video communications a seamless reality. For clarity, we will use the term “guild” to represent a collection of users and channels — they are called “servers” in the client. The term “server” will instead be used here to describe our backend infrastructure. Every audio/video communication in Discord is multiparty. Supporting large group channels (we have seen 1000 people taking turns speaking) requires client-server networking architecture because peer-to-peer networking becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of participants increases. Routing all your network traffic through Discord servers also ensures that your IP address is never leaked whether you use text, voice, or video — preventing anyone from finding out your IP address and launching a DDoS attack against you. Routing audio/video through media servers offers other advantages as well, such as moderation. For example, administrators can disable audio/video for offending participants. Discord runs on lots of platforms. Web (Chrome/Firefox/Edge, etc.) Standalone app (Windows, MacOS, Linux) Phone (iOS/Android). The only way our team can support all these platforms is to take advantage of code re-use and WebRTC . WebRTC is a specification for real-time communication comprised of networking, audio, and video components standardized by both World Wide Web Consortium and Internet Engineering Task Force . WebRTC is available in all modern browsers and also as a native library to embed into applications. Discord’s audio and video features are implemented using WebRTC. This means our browser app relies on the WebRTC implementation offered by the browser. Our desktop, iOS, and Android applications, however, make use of a single C++ media engine built on top of the WebRTC native library — specifically tailored to the needs of our users. This means that certain features work better in the installed application than in the browser. For example, in our native apps we can: Circumvent auto-ducking behavior of the default communications device on Windows. Ducking, or volume attenuation, means that Windows automatically reduces volume of all applications when communications device is used . This is undesirable when you are playing a game and using Discord to coordinate a raid. Implement our own volume control to avoid changing your global operating system volume. Access raw audio data to perform voice activity detection and share both game audio and video. Reduce your bandwidth and CPU consumption during periods of silence — even very large voice channels only have a few concurrent speakers at any given time. Provide system-wide push to talk functionality. Send extra information along with audio/video packets (such as indicating priority speaker). Having a customized version of WebRTC means that we need to keep up-to-date with frequent updates which is a painstaking process that we are working on automating. However, providing specific features to our gamers is well worth the extra effort. In Discord, voice/video communication is initiated by entering a voice channel or call. This means that the communication is always initiated by the client, which reduces both client and backend complexity and also increases resilience against errors. In case of infrastructure failure, participants can simply re-connect to a new backend server. Since we have control of the native library, we do some things differently in the native app than what you see in the browser’s WebRTC implementation. First, WebRTC relies on the Session Description Protocol ( SDP ) to negotiate audio/video information between participants (which can be close to ten kilobytes in size round-trip). Using the WebRTC native library allows us to use a lower level API from WebRTC ( webrtc::Call ) to create both send stream and receive stream. We exchange a minimal amount of information when joining a voice channel. This includes the voice backend server address and port, encryption method and keys, codec, and stream identification (about 1000 bytes). Moreover, WebRTC uses Interactive Connectivity Establishment ( ICE ) to determine the best communication path between participants. Since every client connects to our media relay server, we do not need ICE. This allows us to provide a much more reliable connection when you’re behind a NAT, as well as keep your IP address secret from other parties in the channel. Clients send periodic ping messages to ensure that the firewall remains open all the time. Lastly, WebRTC uses the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol ( SRTP ) for media encryption. The encryption keys are set up using Datagram Transport Layer Security ( DTLS ), which is based on the Transport Layer Security protocol used in your browser every day. The native WebRTC library lets you implement your own transport layer using the webrtc::Transport API. Instead of DTLS/SRTP, we decided to use the faster Salsa20 encryption . In addition, we avoid sending audio data during periods of silence — a frequent occurrence especially with larger groups. This results in significant bandwidth and CPU savings — however, both client and server must be prepared to cease receiving audio data any time and rewrite audio/video packet sequence numbers. Because our browser app uses the browser WebRTC API , we make use of SDP/ICE/DTLS/SRTP. We exchange all necessary information between client and server (less than 1200 bytes round trip) and SDP is synthesized from this information at the clients. Our voice backend infrastructure is responsible for bridging the differences between desktop and browser applications. There are several backend services that make voice possible, but we will focus on three of them — Discord Gateway, Discord Guilds and Discord Voice. All of our signaling servers are written in Elixir allowing lots of code re-use. When you are online, your client maintains a WebSocket connection to a Discord Gateway (we call this the gateway WebSocket connection). Your client receives events through this gateway connection related to guilds, channels, messages, presence, etc. When you are connected to a voice channel, the connection status is represented by the voice state object . The client updates its voice state object using the gateway WebSocket connection. When you join a voice channel, you are assigned to a Discord Voice server. The Discord Voice server is responsible for transmitting every member’s audio to the channel. All the voice channels within a guild are assigned to the same Discord Voice server. If you are the first voice participant in the guild, Discord Guilds server is responsible for assigning a Discord Voice server to the guild using the process described below. Each voice server periodically reports its health and load, and this information is curated and placed into our service discovery system (we use etcd ) as we’ve discussed in a previous blog post . The Discord Guilds server watches the service discovery system and assigns the least utilized voice server in the given region to the guild. When a Discord Voice server is selected, all the voice state objects (also maintained by Discord Guilds) are pushed to voice server so it knows how to set up audio/video forwarding. Clients are also notified about the selected Discord Voice server. The client opens a second WebSocket connection to the voice server (we call this the voice WebSocket connection) which is used for setting up media forwarding and speaking indication. When a client displays “Awaiting Endpoint,” it means that the Discord Guilds server is looking for the best Discord Voice server. When a client displays “Voice Connected,” it means that the client successfully exchanged UDP messages with the selected Discord Voice server. Discord Voice server contains two components: a signaling component and a media relay component called the selective forwarding unit or SFU . The signaling component fully controls the SFU and is responsible for generating stream identifiers and encryption keys, forwarding speaking indication, etc. Our homegrown SFU (written in C++) is responsible for forwarding audio and video traffic within channels. Our SFU is tailored to our use case offering maximum performance and thus the lowest cost. When offending users are moderated (server mute), their audio packets are dropped. The SFU also acts as a bridge between native and browser applications. It implements a transport and encryption for both browser and standalone applications and translates between the two as it forwards media packets. Finally, the SFU is also responsible for handling the real-time control transport protocol ( RTCP ), which is used for video quality optimization. It collects and processes RTCP reports from receivers and notifies senders how much bandwidth is available for video. Since it’s the only service directly accessible from the public Internet, we will focus on Discord Voice server failovers. The signaling component constantly monitors the SFU. If the SFU crashes, it is restarted right away causing minimal service interruption (few dropped packets). The state on the SFU is reconstructed by the signaling component without any client interaction. Although SFU crashes are rare, we use the same mechanism for zero-downtime SFU updates. When a Discord Voice server dies, it fails the periodic ping and gets removed from the service discovery system. The client also notices server failure due to the severed voice WebSocket connection and requests a voice server ping through the gateway WebSocket connection. The Discord Guilds server confirms the failure, consults the service discovery system, and assigns a new Discord Voice server to the guild. Discord Guilds then pushes all the voice state objects to the new voice server. Every client is notified about the new voice server and creates a voice WebSocket connection to the new voice server to start media setup. It is quite common that a Discord Voice server suffers a DDoS attack (which we observe from the rapid increase of incoming IP packets). We perform the same procedure as for Discord Voice server failure: remove the impacted Discord Voice server from the service discovery system, select a new Discord Voice server for the guild, push all the voice state objects to the newly selected Discord Voice server, and notify clients of the new voice server for reconnection. When a DDoS attack subsides, the server is added back to the service discovery system for serving voice traffic. When the guild owner decides to select a new voice region, we perform a very similar procedure as described above. The Discord Guilds server selects the best available Discord Voice server within the new voice region by consulting the service discovery system. It pushes all the voice state objects to the newly selected server and notifies clients about the new voice server. Clients tear down their voice WebSocket connection to the old Discord Voice server and create a new voice WebSocket connection to the new Discord Voice server. Discord Gateway, Discord Guilds and Discord Voice are all horizontally scalable. Discord Gateway and Discord Guilds are running at Google Cloud Platform. We are running more than 850 voice servers in 13 regions (hosted in more than 30 data centers) all over the world. This provisioning includes lots of redundancy to handle data center failures and DDoS attacks. We use a handful of providers and use physical servers in their data centers. We just recently added a South Africa region. Thanks to all our engineering efforts on both the client and server architecture, we are able to serve more than 2.6 million concurrent voice users with egress traffic of more than 220 Gbps (bits-per-second) and 120 Mpps (packets-per-second). We are constantly monitoring voice quality (clients report quality metrics to our backend servers). In the future, we want to use this information to automatically detect and reduce voice degradation issues. Although we released video chat and screen sharing about a year ago, you can currently only use it with direct messaging. When compared to audio, video requires significantly more CPU power and bandwidth. It is a challenge to balance the amount of bandwidth and CPU/GPU resources used to provide the best video quality, especially when a group of gamers in a channel may be on a range of different devices. Scalable Video Coding could be the solution to provide seamless video experience. A big part of Discord is about sharing your gaming experiences with your friends. Screen sharing requires even more bandwidth due to higher frame rate and resolution than your ordinary webcam. We are adding hardware video encoding to our desktop application for a better experience. We have a handful of engineers working on both client and server components and looking after operations as well. We are investing heavily in our voice and video clients and infrastructure to make Discord the best voice and video experience for gamers. We’re always looking for the next great addition to our engineering teams at Discord. If you are passionate about working with audio and video, check out our jobs page!

As always, community feedback is super important to us, so thank you to everyone who sent some words in our direction. Our ears are open and not too waxy. Based on this feedback, we’ve decided to make some adjustments and want to share them with you ahead of our global beta launch. First, we’ll share the specific details about how Nitro is changing. Then, we’ll share how we’re giving love back to our early supporters. As we said in our store announcement blog , Discord Nitro will now include a growing library of critically acclaimed games that we think you and your friends should play. To coincide with this value add, we will be increasing the price of Discord Nitro from $4.99/mo to $9.99/mo. As of today, there’s 42 curated games at a total value of $732.58. We are going to add games to the library at a regular cadence. Games may sometimes leave the Nitro selection (due to our contracts with the developers/publishers expiring without renewal). With our cloud saves, your save data will remain even if games rotate out of our library. We also want an option for those looking to support us but don’t want games. Enter, Nitro Classic. At $4.99/mo, get access to a slew of chat perks like animated avatars, ability to choose your tag (the #0000 next to your username), higher quality screen share, custom emoji anywhere, animated emoji, larger file upload limit (50mb from 8mb), and a badge to show how long you’ve been supporting us. The classic Nitro load-out. Classic indeed. For a whole 24 hours it was actually called Discord Lightro, but it wasn’t meant to be. The person who came up with Lightro is crying right now. They’re also the one writing this blog, so this is actually just a confession of my pain /weeps. Moving on, we have a couple updates for those of you who have generously supported us by subscribing to Nitro before games. As a thank you for your love, anybody subscribed to Nitro before Wednesday, October 10th, 7:20:00 PM PDT will receive access to our growing library of Nitro games at no extra cost for one year (until January 1st, 2020) or until you cancel your subscription. Moreover, yearly subscribers will get access to the same growing library of Nitro games at no extra cost for two years (until January 1st, 2021) or until they cancel their subscription. To be super ultra double clear, you must remain subscribed to receive these perks. Cancelling or changing your plan will result in losing access to the games library. Finally, anybody who EVER subscribed to Nitro prior to the date above will receive an exclusive Early Supporters badge for their profile. We will never give out this badge again. We can’t say it enough — thank you so much for supporting us thus far. It means so much to us that you’ve believed in our product and company and were willing to give us your hard earned cash. We really appreciate it. Thank you again for your feedback as we work through this beta and figure out the best ways for you to discover and play amazing games with your friends.

Now, we’re going to bring the games to you. Today, we’re slowly rolling out a beta test to about 50,000 of our Canadian players and will be expanding to more over time. These players will see an upgraded version of Discord Nitro that has access to a curated selection of games along with the current subscription perks. They’ll also see a new Discord Store tab in the home screen with individual games for purchase. Edit 10.10.2018 7:22 PM PDT: Check out this new blog for full details on the evolved Discord Nitro and Nitro Classic. For many people like us, you grew up during a time when there were a relatively small amount of games being released. We remember devouring Nintendo Power, PC Gamer, and other various gaming mags to get a sense of the titles coming out. We were always longing for the next best title. Always anxious to get our hands on something fresh. Today, the problem has flipped on its head. There’s an abundance of fantastic games. Fantastic games that we missed. Games that we even purchased but never got around to playing. We want to give you an easy opportunity to play the golden games you’ve missed and we want to offer an awesome selection. So, we’ve curated some of these golden games and will be adding them to Discord Nitro. Edit 8.9.2018 1:09 PM PDT: To be clear, if you’re in the beta and you subscribe to Nitro, you’ll get access to all Nitro games (which is a different selection of games than what’s available in the Store). It’s kinda like Netflix for games. We’re excited to offer you the opportunity to catch up with amazing game experiences you might’ve missed and even mix up what you play with your friends from time to time. Of course, we’re keeping all the current Nitro features as part of the perks — animated avatar, ability to choose your tag (the #0000 next to your username), higher quality screen share, custom emoji anywhere, animated emoji, larger file upload limit (50mb from 8mb), and a badge to show how long you’ve been supporting us. You ever been in one of those smaller boutique book shops with recommendations from employees written on little note cards? We love that hands-on personal approach to sharing great content with others. We think this kind of cozy neighborhood book shop vibe would be great for games. It reduces clutter and makes it easier to find what you want. Alongside the upgraded Nitro, we’ll be launching a curated game store experience similar to one of those cozy neighborhood book shops with recommendations about the hottest and newest games from us to you. We’ll be showcasing a variety of titles that we think you’ll like. As the store grows, we’ll rely on our community and our team to make the store feel super personal and focused on games that we genuinely think you’ll enjoy! Here’s an example of a Discord employee’s recommendation of Dead Cells: For our store, we’re excited to announce we’ll be supporting “First on Discord” titles — indie games that we’ve helped bring to life. Supporting indie games pushes the boundary of creative game design and is important to innovation and the long term health of the industry. Of course, we think the games are really cool too! To be very clear, First on Discord games are temporarily exclusive. They’re literally first on Discord — usually 90 days and then the developers can sell anywhere else they want. This beta won’t have any First on Discord titles, but we’ll be showing off some soon! One more surprise for today! We know it’s frustrating to have a bunch of game launchers, so we’ll be adding a Universal Library tab to the Discord home screen as well. If you want, Discord can scan your computer for games. Then, you’ll be able to launch any of your games through Discord even if they require another launcher (Discord will boot the other launcher and game). This way, you don’t have to worry about which game boots from where! Some of you may be wondering… what about chat? Discord’s voice, text, and video chat will continue to be a primary focus for us, with features like overlay text chat and priority speaker which we just launched. We will stay highly focused on maintaining a quality user experience and app performance. We’ve always taken this approach (such as making sure GIFs only play while Discord is focused) and will continue to do this so that chatting in Discord remains awesome. For example, we’re designing the store so that it’s not in your face while you’re hanging out with your friends in a server. With regards to performance, Discord will remain lean and fast. To learn how Discord will remain performant with the store additions, check out our engineering blog on how we keep Discord speedy with code splitting and dynamic loading. Six years ago, the team behind Discord initially developed an iPad MOBA titled Fates Forever. While developing Fates we thought “huh, it’s pretty annoying to get everyone into the same voice chat together.” Then, Stan went home and sautéed what was basically the first version of Discord and served it up the next day (which is ridiculous because Stan has never turned on a stove). After testing Discord out with our friends and family, we realized we were on to something. So, with one company pivot, three years, and a hell of a lot of support from all of you, Discord is where it is today. There are now over 150 million people who’ve used Discord. That’s insane. I can barely count to ten. Through Discord’s lifetime, we’ve always been thinking about fun, additive, and cool ways we could build a business that’s exciting and respects our players. We think the new Nitro and store are a great way to do this. Ultimately, we want to make it easier for you to play games and spend time with your friends. This Nitro boost, store experience, and library will make it easier to find, share, and jump into games with friends all in the same place you already hang out. Achieving all of this will take time, so we hope that you enjoy our limited but tasty selection for now. This is all in beta, so things may change by the time we’re ready to launch. What you see today will likely not be what you see in the future. As always, if you have feedback on things please hit us up on Twitter or comment below. Lastly, we really, truly, appreciate all of you. This wouldn’t be possible without your continued support, so again, thank you. Love, Discord Team P.S.

We can call this the Awesomozoic Era. No dinosaurs here. Instead, we have some awesome updates for the overlay released a couple days ago as well as a preview of some more updates to come. We’ve got pictures for all these things, so please leave if you hate pictures. We know how unreliable the Discord overlay has historically been. We understand how annoying that can be (we use it too!), so we’ve invested heavily in improving overlay performance. We’ve managed to get our overlay success rate up a lot. So basically, it should work most of the time instead of not working. Furthermore, we’ve squashed some bugs like your mouse sticking on screen, pink screen of death, and render failures after alt-tabbing. We’ve finessed our overlay to look more like the app. This redesign also gives us more room to expand and flex the overlay into the future. Anyway, now you’ll see mute and deafen icons next to the voice indicators on the overlay. You can also move the voice indicators anywhere on your game screen now. The rectangle is freeeeee!!! Our longterm vision for the overlay is to make using Discord in game as convenient as possible. We’re aiming for a 647% increase in convenience. You should basically never have to alt-tab if you don’t want to. The overlay should always be there for you and always listen to you when you’re sad and lonely at night. The overlay should be your best friend and sing you lullabies when you can’t fall asleep. As we said earlier, the redesign is a major first step in letting us expand the functionality of the overlay over time. You’ll soon see some sick new features like… Support for more notification types Customizable notifications (what kind and where on screen) Adjustable audio settings Full support for calls Text Chat TEXT CHAAAAAAT T.E.X.T C.H.A.T. TEE EE EX TEE CEE AECH AY TEE Plot twist — you’ll even be able to pin text chat over the game so you can keep track of any Discord chatter while you’re running around Azeroth or jumping out of the battle bus. The chat can be cozy or compact style. Lastly, below you can see a shot of the home bar we’re cookin’ up. The home bar is sort of the master control panel to access all the future goodness that the overlay has to offer… like the Rich Presence game invite feature you also see below! Games with Rich Presence integration will allow you to invite and start parties directly through the Discord overlay. That’s all the pictures the design team let me have. Next time, I’ll bribe them with some salmon jerky to get more. The designs and features here are subject to change because you’re not my boss and we can do what we want, but also because we like to treat projects like this as living and breathing so we can nurture them to the best of what they can be.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord maintains performance while adding features", "author": ["Michael Greer"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-maintains-performance-while-adding-features-28ddaf044333", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com When people complain about “bloat” in software, they often mean that every new feature makes it slower to load, takes more memory, and taxes their CPU. We know that our users are sensitive to performance: they are likely playing a visually intense game while talking on Discord with their friends and the last thing we want to do is cause performance issues. We always keep this in mind when adding new features like video chat, screen sharing, or the overlay. For our desktop app, we achieve great performance while adding features with something called code splitting which loads code on demand. Every time you load an app, it has to load up code and layout styles in order to run. Each piece of this takes time to load and parse while increasing the app’s memory usage. Segmenting the code required to get the app going makes it load faster and use less memory than if we bundled it all together. This also means that not all of the code is available instantly, but if the bundles are kept small and are well-planned, the user will not experience the loading anyway. When you boot up Discord, the core set of JavaScript, fonts, images, and stylesheets is about 700KB: about the size of Google’s minimal homepage in a browser. Everything else is loaded on-demand, allowing users to get the parts that matter most to them quickly (and so new users responding to invites don’t need to load the whole web app). As you switch around different views in Discord, you are switching routes through the codebase. We wrap the components for each route in a function which gets called when you arrive at the route. The tool we use to bundle and optimize our code, called webpack, bundles these routes into separate chunks and automates most of the loading. A problem with this loader is that it can potentially fail to load a chunk. When this happens, the component does not not appear and an error is thrown. To remedy this, we built a custom loader called makeLazy which continues trying at increasing intervals until it succeeds: The routes also contain stylesheets to layout the screens. Like our code, our stylesheets are split into loadable chunks and only arrive when needed. Even our animations throughout the app are lazy loaded which allows us to continue adding art and polish while keeping performance high. Additionally, we support a lot of translations in the app. Code splitting allows us to load only the one you use. You might notice this when switching locales because it takes a moment to load the new one. This is our code splitting dynamically loading the required chunk to display the language. With this technique, we’re able to support as many unique languages as we want without impacting performance. We currently have 27 translations, so at 30KB each this saves the user nearly 1MB. Code splitting lets us add languages, features, and polish without bloating the app. Performance is a core feature of Discord. As we continue to improve the app, we will be sure to keep it lean and fast. We’re always looking for the next great addition to our engineering teams at Discord.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "why discord is sticking with react native", "author": ["Fanghao (Robin) Chen"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-sticking-with-react-native-ccc34be0d427", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Being one of the first apps built with React Native, we were excited to share our first year journey using React Native back in 2016. Looking back at the past three years, React Native has proven to be extremely successful at Discord and helped drive our iOS user adoption from zero to millions! More specifically, React Native has allowed us to reap the benefits of quickly leveraging reusable code across platforms, as well as develop a small and mighty team. Meanwhile, we’ve learned to adapt to its inevitable pain points without sacrificing overall productivity. We tried React Native literally the day it came out, holding off on building our iOS app because we knew it would be announced at React.js Conf 2015 . Similar to iOS, we tried React Native the day it was released for Android. We were surprised by how easily and quickly we were able to make our comprehensive iOS app run on Android — took only two days and it built! However, we immediately stopped after identifying various issues such as poor performance of touch events and lack of 64-bit support . We continued to follow React Native Android through observing many other apps and blog posts, but there have been no fundamental improvements to convince us to try again. Though React Native was not ideal for Android, we realized it would be for iOS. While it might seem odd to choose React Native for only one mobile platform, especially considering React Native was all about “learn once for mobile instead of twice”, it’s given us a lot of benefits, such as: React and Flux make up our web front-end tech stack. Therefore we can easily leverage over nearly all of the business logic (i.e. stores and libraries) and a majority of our front-end tooling and infrastructure (e.g. eslint , prettier and flow ) from web to iOS. Allowing our React Native engineers to focus on a top-notch iOS app without needing to be proficient at the Android platform. The Discord iOS app has millions of daily active users and 4.8 stars with over 240k ratings. This has all been accomplished with a team of two engineers! React Native allows us to keep our team small and efficient while maintaining Discord values like: Offering great opportunities to learn and grow. I joined Discord as a native iOS developer, and conversely, our other developer Victoria joined with a web development background. Like many other engineers at Discord, we both were motivated to step out of our comfort zones, learn a new platform, and eventually become more versatile engineers. Sharing as much code as possible without sacrificing the user experience. Front-end engineers really own their features across web and iOS platforms through reusable code. Just like our iOS team, Discord is thriving through learning, growing and leveraging expertise every day. As a result, we are incredibly proud of our amazing engineer to user ratio at Discord — 40 engineers to 130M+ users. Without diving into the app, we can use storybook to quickly render \"dumb\" components that don't manage any state internally with mock props. By leveraging the same tooling, we can quickly follow the web team who originally adopted storybook. Along with hot reloading, storybook dramatically accelerates our UI development cycle. Our designers can even easily tweak styling directly in storybook. It was painful and time consuming to upgrade our React Native fork which fixes issues specific to our use cases. Nowadays, releases are more stable. Compared to spending days before, it only took us few hours to upgrade our fork to 0.55 from 0.53 recently. However, our web team usually upgrades React and/or other shared dependencies faster than the iOS team. Being on different versions of shared frameworks may cause non-obvious problems which leads to time-consuming investigation. For instance, the iOS app encountered an instant crash in a full-release build although it ran fine locally. After bisecting commits on master, it turned out that the web-only webpack 4 upgrade broke the iOS build due to shared base configs. However, we were able to learn from those issues and apply the knowledge to our infrastructure which ultimately benefits all the teams. A few days ago, we were able to quickly deploy a post-release fix for cameras and skip the approval process. We can’t even begin to count how many OTAs we’ve shipped. Being allowed more room for mistakes, engineers can ship often with confidence and avoid coordination, which unblocks everyone. In the past three years, React Native has proven to be a great platform which allows engineers to move at an unparalleled speed. Getting it right has required a fair bit of learning, so we’d like to dive deeper into how we’ve learned and adapted to some pain points without sacrificing overall productivity. Like any technology, React Native is not perfect, but it excites us to see Facebook and the community at large actively working towards improving or eliminating its weaknesses like large-scale re-architecture and better flow type coverage. React Native is certainly a revolutionary and fast-moving framework, so the challenges we face today are quite different than what we faced three years ago. For instance, while learning to reuse front-end tooling, we started with React Native Webpack Server , but after a year found out it was abandoned. We eventually had a non-trivial migration to Haul for React 16 . Next, we want to share how we conquered our top five pain points with React Native. Hopefully, it will help you too! Immature long lists have been a well known issue since day one. Without a doubt, we have encountered the same problem in our core component: the chat view. Alternatively, we use UITableView for smooth scrolling performance and dynamic cell heights. Furthermore, our chat view is extensively controlled by Javascript. It computes all the data sources in Javascript, passes them to Objective-C as properties, renders the entire table view in Objective-C via Yoga directly (the same layout engine React Native uses), and finally sends events back to Javascript for user interactions. It’s worth mentioning that this chat view is so far the only native view we have, which means the hundreds of other of React Native components we have are able to provide a satisfying 60fps performance. Facebook is solving this problem by re-architecting the threading model : It will be possible to call synchronously into JavaScript on any thread for high-priority updates. We also found a quick workaround for high-priority UI updates while we worked on synchronous keyboard layout animation. All the keyboard layout solutions are one frame behind when start dismissing keyboard and therefore results in a noticeable gap between TextInput and keyboard. After various attempts at solutions like InputAccessoryView , we eventually figured out a way to \"portal\" the React Native component into native iOS views hierarchy and therefore manage high-priority keyboard updates synchronously in native. We will detail this more in a later blog post. In React Native world, a web developer will take much longer to succeed than a native developer. Most of the time, it has been smooth sailing working on React Native. However, you sometimes come across very specific native technical details, or find yourself working on OS-specific features like the share extension on iOS . Web developers will likely take longer to learn and sometimes need help from engineers with native experience. But once they learn and grow, they can share valuable information across front-end platforms and help keep our teams small and mighty. Time to Interaction (TTI) is a key aspect of how a user perceives the performance of an app. The TTI of our iOS app is noticeably longer than other competing messaging apps written in native code. Since React Native loads and parses all the Javascript code before execution, you get startup delay based on bundle size. In our case, it’s roughly 1.5s startup delay to load a 15mb bundle on an iPhone X. Fortunately, Facebook documented unbundling to only load necessary portions of the bundle for startup and progressively load more as needed via their packager. However, Haul , our React Native packager replacement for webpack, doesn’t support unbundling/code splitting yet . We wish React Native was more webpack friendly out of the box; we will inevitably need our front-end infrastructure engineers to build this in-house. In the React Native repo, we sometimes see hot issues with limited activity in response from Facebook. Lack of visibility into such a large company can bring about frustrations when so many people depend on their open source contributions. On the other hand, it forces us to dive into the core codebase in order to figure out the problem, which admittedly one of the best ways to learn an open source platform. By understanding the React Native platform deeply, we were able to maintain a fork that fixes issues for our own use cases and reuse their core modules. For instance, our UIImageView , for avatars and/or emojis in native chat, reuses RCTImageLoader for consistent caching. React Native is a great framework that bridges the gap between web and mobile. At Discord it has brought us incredibly efficiency. It allows us to write reusable code, learn from each other, and move fast with a two person team. Although there are real pain points and challenges, the overall gains significantly outweigh the costs which motivates us to keep investing in the platform. We’re always looking for the next great addition to our engineering teams at Discord.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "the four values of working at discord", "author": ["Jason Citron"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/the-four-values-of-working-at-discord-90d5b5102cbc", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Years ago, when starting the company that became Discord, I wanted to build a workplace that was rewarding, challenging, and positive. To achieve this, I started with a simple question, “How do you create a place where people can thrive doing their best work?” My goal for sharing this philosophy is to give everyone a glimpse into how we do things — especially those of you who may be considering joining the team. The answer begins with the way leaders see themselves. We have a tremendous impact on the shape of the workplace and I believe that traditional top-down management fails to bring out the best in people. At Discord, our leadership philosophy is bottoms-up, meaning managers act as support and guidance for individual contributors. I remember loving the jobs where my boss would coach me and give frequent tips on how to do better. I remember hating the jobs where my boss would micromanage me while giving feedback once a year. Contrary to popular Silicon Valley belief, hiring slow and maintaining a small team has tons of benefits. Hiring slowly allows us to take our time to find excellent candidates who truly understand Discord’s mission to bring gamers together. It means our team has a greater opportunity to gel and develop meaningful relationships. Best of all, it means that each employee has a deeper opportunity to learn and grow with the company. Furthermore, a small team forces us to choose the work that brings us the greatest results — the path of highest compounding leverage. It forces us to say no to good ideas and yes to great ones. With all that said, over time I’ve come to settle on four values (inspired by a variety of sources including this talk ) which I believe create the kind of environment that talented top performers thrive in: autonomy, mastery, purpose, and compassion People want the freedom to be creative in their approach to solving problems. I’ve found the conditions needed for someone to be creative boil down to two questions and the space to answer them — what outcome am I trying to achieve and why does this outcome matter? The entirety of our planning process is about clarifying the what and why of someone’s work. The entirety of our management process is about supporting people to actually do the work which ties into our leadership philosophy as written above. One of the most motivating things for a high performing person is making sure their work is important and challenging. Their projects should let them stretch beyond their comfort zone, but not so far that they aren’t successful. To make sure they succeed, everyone provides constant, real time feedback. We don’t do drawn out performance reviews every year. Instead, we shatter the typical feedback process into hundreds of digestible bits. This structure creates an incredibly fast learning cycle that allows everyone to grow and improve in real time instead of accumulating feedback into a grueling annual review. Over time, I’ve seen junior folks grow into strong senior contributors — and even managers — through this approach. Feedback is a dialogue at Discord and we recruit everyone to participate regardless of position. Team members are encouraged to give their feedback to leadership as much as leadership is encouraged to share feedback with their team members. Many of the best relationships in my life were built playing games. I have such great memories playing all sorts of games with the people closest to me like my wife, brother, and best friends. Some people here appreciate games through time spent playing with their kids or see it in their spouse’s close relationships. Whatever the specific connection is, the point is to deliberately hire people who can connect with our mission. When they do, it means they sweat the details. It means people put in the extra oomph to make something great. So many things just “happen” because people care. It’s not possible to manufacture this — we look for it during our hiring process and only hire people who care about why we’re doing what we’re doing. At Discord, people don’t leave their personal life at the door. We expect people to show up to do great work. That said, some days you’re just in a bad mood or having a rough time with something at home. We respect each other as people and have come to realize that acknowledging people’s emotions and keeping feelings in the open creates a much more supportive and effective environment. I remember a day when one of our executives noticed a team member was on the verge of tears at their desk because of a personal issue. At a moment like that, work doesn’t matter — they put it aside and took a walk to chat about what was going on. Not only did it give the team member the opportunity to talk through what was going on in their personal life, it also gave the executive an opportunity to understand what that team member was going through. These kinds of emotionally reflective and vulnerable conversations happen often at Discord. Sustained productivity comes from healthy work-life harmony. Each person has their own lifestyle and circumstance which informs their work schedule. For example, many employees at Discord have children and keep family hours — working a solid 8 hours every day and then off to have dinner and tuck their kids in. Everyone does what’s best for their own situation and their team to ensure sustainable productivity. We respect and accommodate what each person needs to be most effective. Through these foundational principles applied each and every day, we try to thoughtfully create an environment where talented, diverse people from all walks of life feel supported and encouraged to do great work. Along the way, we make sure to have fun, to celebrate our victories, to eat good food, and to share pet pictures, of course. Take a look: If this looks and sounds like the kind of place you’d like to work, come apply for one of our many jobs and join us on our mission to bring people together around games.

You’ll learn how Mike leveraged Discord to: Get vital player feedback Build an excited community Support the game on launch We dig the decision to bring the in-game factions inside of Discord. It’s an awesome way to keep people engaged and connected with the community. We’re also stoked and surprised by how players helped flip negative reviews to positive after launch. If you’re looking for some more beginner-level server set up, check out this old community building post we dug up and dusted off from 2015. It’s still relevant. Mostly. Kinda. Anyway, now for Mike… When we were planning the announcement for Descenders, we knew that we wanted Discord to play a huge role in what we were cooking up. We’ve all been Discord fans for a while now and have watched how influential the platform has become — but on top of that, building a community for your game has become one of the best ways to ensure success, especially with the sheer volume of games being released every day. As a result, it made way too much sense for us to build our Descenders community through Discord from the very beginning. But, simply throwing up a Discord server and hoping people join isn’t how we roll. We wanted to offer potential community members real reasons to join us on Discord, via beta access, exclusive content, meta-games, ARGS, the works. What we didn’t realize at the time was just how integral our Discord community would be in shaping how Descenders has evolved. From community feedback, to language translations, to realizing the key strengths of the game, to supporting our game sales and ratings on launch, our community has helped to mold our vision into the game you see today and set us up for success moving forward. I’m Mike Rose from publishing label No More Robots and I’m working with Dutch studio RageSquid on an extreme downhill biking game titled Descenders. The game launched last month on Steam and is coming to consoles very soon. Descenders is a mountain biking game featuring procedurally generated worlds and roguelite elements through which your bone-crunching mistakes have real consequences on your progression through the ranks. From early on in development, it became obvious to us that Descenders was going to benefit heavily from community involvement. We had this whole explosion of features we wanted to add to the game but weren’t sure which features would be most sought after. Rather than trying to guess what people wanted out of a mountain biking game, it made more sense to, you know, ask people! The biggest question for me was: What makes someone want to join a community? Why would someone choose to join my Discord server? What could I possibly offer that would make sense for them to not only join, but then also stick around? The answer, it turned out, was kinda simple: People want free stuff People want exclusive stuff People want to feel like they’re part of something Here’s how I aimed to fulfill these desires: Give everyone who joined our Discord server free access to the Descenders beta Post exclusive Descenders stuff regularly for Discord members Create an entire meta-game within the Discord server The first two points are fairly self-explanatory. Everyone who wanted to try the game earlier had to join our Discord and throw some simple details into a Google form. Once they had, we’d give them exclusive screenshots, updates, livestreams, GIFs, videos, etc. Everything they could possibly want from the game. The meta-game aspect excited me the most. What sort of game could I build within Discord that would not only make people want to stick around but also bring them together as a community? In Descenders, you pick one of three teams to join. Team Enemy are all about slick stunts while Team Arboreal focus on off-road action. Meanwhile, Team Kinetic are the game’s speed demons. Once you pick your team, you’re given exclusive missions, gear, and colors based on that team. Using Dyno, the popular Discord bot, I created a series of custom commands that would introduce each newcomer to our server into the meta-game. When you initially join the server, your username is white and you’re only granted access to a small number of channels. When you visit the #pick-a-side channel, it asks you to type either !enemy, !arboreal or !kinetic to pick a team. Once you choose, the #pick-a-side channel disappears and the rest of the server is opened up — including channels that are exclusive to your team. Your name also becomes the same color as the team you picked. The plan was then simple: Each week, we would pit these three teams against one other in a variety of challenges, ranging from custom kit design competitions to “which team can write the best Descenders haiku?” When we announced Descenders last summer, the server was an immediate hit and we quickly built up a community of over 4000 members. The weekly challenges worked great and each team enjoyed politely trash talking each other in the #trash-talk channel we’d created. There were even community members who stuck team stickers on their bike helmets and filmed themselves trashing the other teams. We created custom emotes for each team and gave them exclusive prizes in their team channels when they won a weekly challenge. The meta-game worked out pretty damn well! Soon afterwards, we ran the Descenders closed beta through Discord. We announced the beta date via an ARG that we distributed in the server. We expected our community to take a few days to decipher a riddle that we dropped into the server, as it involved pretty damn obscure solutions like looking through Google Maps images and playing RageSquid’s previous game — but they’d solved it two hours later which was kinda mind blowing. Everyone in the server was sent a Steam beta key and for one weekend we let them all go wild. Thousands of people signed up and our Discord server was in a constant meltdown the entire time — the good kind. The community posted thoughts, screenshots, GIFs, videos, fan art… we ended up putting together a supercut of some of the best beta footage. We also ended up with tons of valuable feedback from the Discord community. We had a #bug-reporting channel, a channel for requesting features, a channel for players to show off their skills via videos and GIFs. It allowed us to connect directly with our players throughout the beta and get their immediate, honest feedback at all times. As a thank you after the full launch, we gave everyone who was a part of the beta a special beta kit within the game to say thanks for taking part. It was the least we could do! The benefits to having a Discord community for Descenders go on and on. Members of our community have created kits, banners and boards for the game, while giving us a variety of ideas that we have eventually followed up on and added to the game. Furthermore, certain aspects of game development became a whole lot easier thanks to our server. For example, we asked which languages our community would like the game to be translated into. Within a few days, we’d found multiple members of our community who wanted to help translate the game, and after providing them with the English text via a Google Sheet, we had all the text in the game translated into a variety of languages, including French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Russian… We’re so happy that these players will be able to enjoy the game in their native languages. One of the biggest pros has been having a direct method for finding out exactly what players enjoy about the game and where we should be expanding the game. For example, within a week of the game launching, our Discord community was clamoring for a way to generate levels based on a specific seed. We had no idea this would be such a popular request! It was actually relatively easy to add, so three weeks after launch, we added this feature as an entirely new mode and our community exploded all over again. Speaking of launch, it’s worth stressing that all of these positives definitely carried over into the launch of the game. From the moment the game launched on February 9th, our Discord community started buying it in spades and we rocketed into the Top Sellers list within the space of 30 minutes. The 10% launch discount didn’t activate for 25 minutes after we hit the live button, so we told our community to wait until it kicked in. Tons of them purposely ignored us and bought it full price just so that they could be the first to play. We love them all a bit too much. It wasn’t just sales that came out of our community — there were plenty of other cool side-effects that we hadn’t considered. For example, our community piled positive ratings onto the Steam page, quickly leaving us with a 90% user rating that hasn’t gone away. And whenever someone does leave a negative review or a bad comment on the Steam forums, someone from our community spots it immediately and tries to resolve the player’s problem. This has actually lead to multiple negative reviews being flipped into positive which, as you’d imagine, has been rather amazing for the game. Our Discord has been a buzz of activity since the game launched last month, and it hasn’t showed any signs of slowing down. When someone new pops in to ask for help or simply to give their thoughts on the game, our members welcome them, suggest they pick a team, and then bring them into the fray. It’s a wonderful atmosphere for new players to be introduced to and we don’t have to lift a finger — our community does it all for us. Our experience with building a Discord community for Descenders has been incredible and I now have plans to incorporate Discord into every game I publish. In fact, No More Robots announced our second title today called Not Tonight , and the Discord server for Not Tonight is even more ridiculous, with tiered roles and “jobs” that members can do to earn higher accolades and special prizes. Community has always been a great device to build a video game around and that is more true now than ever before. You should be thinking about how Discord is going to fit around your game launch — it’ll be one of the best things you do. Thanks Mike for sharing all the cool ways Discord can be used to empower a game’s community. We’re super excited to see how his next server plays out!

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord renders rich messages on the android app", "author": ["Andy Garron"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-renders-rich-messages-on-the-android-app-67b0e5d56fbe", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Discord’s chat messages support both markdown and direct mentions of users, roles, channels, and various other entities. Detecting and rendering rich content in messages is a more complex challenge than it may appear on the surface. This post will detail how our clients detect and render markdown and entity mentions in messages. In particular, the Discord Android app required a homegrown solution to maintain parity with the Desktop and iOS clients. As a result, we’ve open-sourced SimpleAST , our Android parsing and rendering solution. Read on to learn more about Discord’s approach to rich messages, and how we solve this challenge on Android! One issue of particular interest is the case of entity mentions, i.e. direct references to users, roles, or channels. In these cases, we want messages to reflect name changes. For example, a message may mention me: @AndyG. If I decide to change my name to xXSSJ4AndyGXx , this old message should now render as @xXSSJ4AndyGXx instead. To accomplish this, we avoid sending @AndyG as raw text in the message. Instead, we send <@123456789> , a reference to my user ID. This puts the burden on the receiving-end Discord clients to detect mentions in messages, and transform them back into the appropriate username when rendering the message. In order to do so, our clients need a parsing + rendering system that that satisfies three major requirements: Extensibility : the system must detect basic markdown (like * italics* and **bold** ) as well as artisanal strategies like the @ User mention described above. Structure : the system should lend structure to the otherwise unstructured raw text. With structure, the messages can be inspected and post-processed as we see fit. Performance : gotta go fast. We found a solution in Khan Academy’s open-source simple-markdown library. The web, desktop, and iOS versions of the Discord app are all written in JavaScript, so simple-markdown could be used directly. The simple-markdown process looks like this: Clients define a list of rules which define the various formatting and entities (like an @User mention) that can appear in text. This meets our extensibility requirement. The simple-markdown parser uses that list of rules to transform raw text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This meets our structure requirement. The generated AST is then passed into a renderer , where it is transformed into some format that the client can display and interact with. By adding our own rules, we can support various types of rich content in messages: simple-markdown worked great for the Discord desktop and iOS clients, but left our Android app out in the cold, since our Android app is built natively, not React Native (as discussed in a previous blog post ). Without a parser of our own, we could still easily replace entities like @User mentions with a find/replace to detect <@123456789> occurrences when rendering the message. In fact, the Android app functioned like this for some time in 2016. Certain problems proved extremely difficult to solve, however: With our naive regexes on Android, there were many rendering inconsistencies between the Android app and our other clients. For example, formatting (like **bold** ) worked inside of **code blocks** — it shouldn’t. We were not able to directly port the parser rules from the Desktop client. Any time Discord added a new rule, we had to worry about introducing weird edge-cases on Android, or at least losing parity. Discord’s desktop search feature allows for structured query parameters like from: AndyG#0001 (among others). We were about to implement search on Android and we knew that leaning on a robust parser would make it easier to detect and use such structured parameters. The writing was on the wall: if we were going to maintain parity without excessive engineering effort, we were going to need our own version of simple-markdown that ran on the JVM to power our Android app. Remember that the system we wanted would need to do two things: Parse raw text into an Abstract Syntax Tree Render that AST as text on Android We’ll focus on parsing for now. Remember the three components that constitute the parse step: Node : a node in an AST which can have children. This defines how we represent an AST in code Rule : a rule which defines what types of nodes are generated by what types of text Parser : using a list of rules, takes raw text and turns it into a collection of nodes For the code-inclined, an example Rule looked like this: Note that the Parser processes the input left-to-right as rules are matched. To support that, a Pattern that defines a Rule MUST only match with text at the BEGINNING of the source. This is why we include the ^ character at the beginning of all of our Rule patterns! This was our initial Parser implementation: Hello StackOverflowException , My Old Friend Our Rule interface required each Rule to return a Node with all its children already parsed and populated. To accomplish this, many Rule instances were calling parser.parse() on the text they were inspecting. This algorithm was simple to understand, but meant we could recurse arbitrarily deeply if we nested formatting. In other words, nest enough formatting in a message, and you could trivially crash the app by causing a stack overflow ! We needed Rule instances to contribute their information to the AST without recursively parsing their content. We solved this by having each Rule return only a single top-level Node . If it was a non-terminal Node (like a bold or italics node), it would also specify start and end indices that inform the Parser what slice of the original input needs to be parsed to supply that node’s children. In other words, our rules now return both a Node and a potential “deferred parse” specified in a ParseSpec class: This allows us to change our parse strategy to use an explicit 🥞 stack 🥞 that tracks what parsing still needs to be done. The stack typically does not grow larger than a few elements in practice, as new ParseSpec instances are used immediately. For implementation details, see the source code here . The app functioned with this parser for a very long time. We still noticed a little chug on older phones (which represent a significant portion of our user base), but it wasn’t immediately obvious where any performance improvements could be squeezed out of the parser. We used the Android Profiler (introduced last year in Android Studio 3.0), which provides a flame chart that aggregates method calls into a readable form that makes it easier to see where you are spending your computational time. We noticed that a lot of time was spent in the method Pattern.matcher() , which creates a new Matcher instance: It appeared that most of our time during a parse was actually spent inside of Matcher.<init> , in particular in Matcher.usePattern , with some time in Matcher.reset . It was strange to spend a lot of time here — why were we creating so many Matcher instances? We looked around for initialization points of Matcher , and the culprit lay in this line of the Parser : Instantiating a Matcher every time we want to use a rule to inspect the text was expensive and, as it turns out, unnecessary: Matcher has a method that is specifically designed to allow a single instance to be reused multiple times on different sources. Up until this point, we had bundled Pattern instances inside our Rule objects. Thanks to the Android Profiler, we identified this issue and began bundling prebuilt Matcher instances instead: Using this strategy, we were able to see as much as a 2.4x speedup on certain real-world messages, depending on the complexity of the parse parsing needed to be done. Warning: If Rule (and by extension, Parser ) instances are shared across threads, multiple threads could reset the same Matcher to different source texts. Therefore, usages of a given Rule or Parser instance should be confined to a single thread. We’ve got an AST now with nodes that represent various pieces of text, styles, and other entities like user mentions, emojis, etc. Rendering is a simple process compared to parsing. Android has a mechanism for building text with various styles: a SpannableStringBuilder . We create a SpannableStringBuilder and pass it to each node; they operate on the builder in turn. To facilitate this, a Node<T> in SimpleAST has the following method: In simple cases, nodes may simply append text to the builder, apply styles to the text in the builder, or make the text clickable or otherwise interactable. In more complex cases, nodes may specify a type T that provides information that they need in order to render themselves, ie.e. their renderContext . This could be something as simple as and Android Context so that the node can resolve resources, or it could be a data structure that, for example, facilitates the node looking up usernames for a given user ID. SimpleAST currently powers the Android app’s message rendering, and we’re happy with its performance, robustness, and extensibility. It also lends us the power to keep up with the fast-changing requirements of Discord as a product, since porting parser rules to Android is such a breeze. That said, there are some opportunities we see with both SimpleAST and its use in our app going forward: Parse off the UI thread: We parse and render each message on the UI thread on-demand as the message rendered on the screen. This means that during fast scrolls, there can be a noticeable frame drop, especially on low-end devices. Instead, we could parse the messages at an earlier stage in the pipeline, on a thread pool dedicated to parsing these messages. The upside is that this would make the scrolling experience butter-smooth on all devices. However, if implemented naively, it could manifest as a longer load-time for batch messages loading. Intelligently implementing message parsing off the UI thread is one of the most exciting opportunities for performance improvements in the Android app today. Further SimpleAST performance improvements: We will continue to push more performance out of the SimpleAST library, with a helping hand from the Android Profiler. We’re always looking for the next great addition to our engineering teams at Discord.

Discord is built out of hundreds of projects. To our surprise, many open source communities have adopted Discord for their own discussions. Today we are launching a site highlighting the open source communities who live on Discord . When Reactiflux came to us years ago saying they were being kicked off Slack due to scaling reasons , we were skeptical that non-gaming communities could thrive on Discord. We were wrong: Reactiflux has grown to over 13,000 users, with 2,000–3,000 active at any one time, more than most other chat app communities. And they are not the only ones: we have also seen Vue.js, ReasonML, Elixir, and Yarn become vibrant and communicative groups on Discord. They have tried using other chat apps, but have run into the limits of those platforms. It turns out that not only is Discord easy to use, but many open source developers already have Discord accounts because they play games. One Discord account gets you access to every open source community, so the invite link is all people need to begin participating. Discord also has robust moderation and blocking tools which serve open source projects well. We also support webhooks from GitHub as well as Slack . Discord has features that both gamers and developers value: Core features are free forever Infinite message history Unlimited members Unlimited search Familiarity of Discord ( 100m+ people use it ) Syntax highlighting Tool integrations Voice and video chat Screen sharing Moderation, roles, and permissions Private ad-hoc groups We hope you’ll give Discord a shot for your open source community!

As 2017 comes to a close, we do believe a moment of humble reflection is in order. At the end of 2016, we wrote a blog post promising that we would build out a variety of features including Search, Audit Logs, Channel Categories, Video Chat, and Screen Share. Well… we shipped all of it! And much, much more! Even T.A.Y.N.E! We would like to thank each and every one of you for your patience and absence of ‘screensharewhen’ posts as we built and polished these features ahem. Furthermore, we’ve recently launched some super awesome game related features including Rich Presence and Verified Servers so devs can make your experience as a player even better. We’ve got a lot in store for developers next year, so literally wait. It’s insane how much support you guys have given us since Discord began 2.5 years ago. Our minds continue to literally be unable to fathom the amount of support and people who use Discord today. In the six months since we last announced how Discord is doing, we’ve gone from 45 million to 87 million registered players, which we expect to hit 90 million by the end of the year. That’s a whole lotta growing. We’re gonna need new sneakers to fit these big feet. Check out our growth with this stylish and easily-digestible infographic: We were also trying to figure out how many times you guys said ‘screensharewhen’ on Twitter but realized counting grains of sand is faster. 1,240,504… Next year is gonna be pretty awesome too. We have a banana bunch of stuff hanging from ripe Discord trees — soon to be picked and sent to your delicious mouth. Uptime —Discord is usually up, kicking ass, and chewing bubble gum. Our mission is to keep it that way. Our engineers wrote a technical postmortem of the service interruption a couple weeks ago and how we plan to take action and improve our system. Voice Connection Quality and Stability — some say, “ Is Discord Really The Best? ” We will continue to make sure we are. No more no routes (or at least, way less). Overlay Improvements — making it more robust overall and adding some dope features to make it an awesome extension of Discord while you’re in game. Rich Presence — we will continue to support game developers as they integrate with Discord. Expect tons more games — from the indiest of indies to the biggiest of biggies. Community Requested Features — We love building stuff you ask for , so Priority Speaker is being sautéed right now. We’re throwing Screen Share back into the oven, cooking up some audio with it this time. Thanks for letting us know it needed a little spice. And more! There’s some stuff we can’t reveal quite yet and there’s stuff we don’t even know about yet. The future is crazy, man. Finally, our mission here at Discord is to bring people together around games. Diversity and inclusiveness are a critical part of how we get there. We’ve created some internal goals for 2018 to make Discord a more diverse company. And yes, we’re hiring! Basically, 2018 is gonna be awesome. We can’t wait to be there with you guys. Thanks for all the constant love and support ❤ Did I mention we’re hiring? Check out our jobs page here!

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord resizes 150 million images every day with go and c", "author": ["Brian Armstrong"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-resizes-150-million-images-every-day-with-go-and-c-c9e98731c65d", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Despite being a voice and text chat app, Discord sees over a hundred million images passing through its tubes every day. While we wish it was as simple as sending them out across the tubes to your friends, delivering these images creates some pretty large technical problems. Linking directly to images would leak users’ IP addresses to image hosts, and large images use up lots of bandwidth. To circumvent these problems, Discord needs an intermediary service to fetch images on behalf of users and then resize them to reduce bandwidth usage. To handle this job, we created a Python service creatively named Image Proxy. It fetched images from remote URLs and then used the pillow-simd package to do the heavy lifting of image resizing. Pillow-simd is wonderfully fast and uses x86 SSE instructions to accelerate resizing where it can. The Image Proxy would receive a HTTP request containing a URL to fetch, resize, and finally respond with the image. On top of this, we setup a caching layer that would try to keep resized images around in memory and respond directly from cache when it could. A HAProxy layer routes requests based on a URL hash to the Nginx caching layer. The cache performs request coalescing in order to minimize the number of resize transformations required. This combination of cache and proxy was enough to scale our image proxy up well into millions of users. Still, as Discord grew, the Image Proxy started to show signs of strain. The biggest problem was the Image Proxy did not have an even workload distribution, which hampered its throughput. Image proxying requests saw a wide variance of response times, with some taking multiple seconds to complete. We likely could have addressed this behavior in Image Proxy, but we had been experimenting with using more Go, and it seemed like a good place to try Go out. It’s not an easy decision to rewrite a service that’s already working. Thankfully, Image Proxy was relatively simple, and comparing results between it and the replacement service would be straightforward. In addition to serving requests faster, the new service would also get new features, including the ability to get the first frame from .mp4 and .webm videos — hence, Media Proxy. We began by benchmarking existing image resizing packages for Go and quickly discovered something disheartening. While Go is generally a faster language than Python, none of the resizing packages we could find could beat Pillow-simd consistently in performance. Most of the work done by the Image Proxy was in the image transcoding and resizing, so this would be a significant bottleneck in Media Proxy if it were slower. Go might be a little faster at handling HTTP, but if it can’t resize images quickly, the extra speedup would be lost to the extra time spent resizing. We decided to double down and put together our own image resizing package for Go. We had seen some promise when we benchmarked one Go package that wrapped OpenCV , but that package didn’t support all of the features we wanted. We created our own Go image resizer, named Lilliput , which has its own Cgo wrapper on top of OpenCV. Lilliput has been made with careful consideration toward not creating garbage in Go. Lilliput’s OpenCV wrapper does almost everything we want, though we still had to fork OpenCV slightly before we were happy with it. In particular, we wanted to be able to inspect image headers before deciding whether to start decompressing them, since this would allow us to immediately refuse to resize any that are too large. Lilliput uses the existing and mature C libraries for image compression and decompression (e.g. libjpeg-turbo for JPEG, libpng for PNG) and OpenCV’s fast vectorized resizing code. We added fasthttp to handle our concurrent HTTP client and server requirements. Finally with this combination we had a service which steadily beat Image Proxy in synthetic benchmarks. When comparing lilliput to pillow-simd, we found that lilliput performed as well as or better than pillow-simd in the use cases we care about. The early code was not without issues. Initially, Media Proxy would leak 16 bytes on each request. This is a small enough loss that it takes quite a while to manifest, especially when testing at a small scale. Compounding the issue, Media Proxy keeps large static pixel buffers around for resizing purposes. It uses two of these buffers per CPU, so on a 32-core host its initial memory usage is several GB. It would take hours for Media Proxy to be restarted due to exhausting all of the system memory during testing. This was a long enough duration that it was hard to tell if we actually had a memory leak or if runtime usage was just putting us over the limit. Eventually, we concluded that there must indeed be some kind of memory leak. We weren’t sure whether the leak was present in Go or C++, and reviewing the code failed to turn up the source of the leak. Fortunately, Xcode ships with an outstanding memory profiler — the Leaks tool in Instruments . This tool revealed the size of the leak and approximately where it was occurring. This was enough of a hint that further review allowed us to identify and fix the leak. We encountered another showstopper bug in Media Proxy. Sometimes it would respond with strangely corrupted images where half of the image would be correct and the other half would appear “glitched”. We initially suspected that we might have been decoding partially retrieved images or somehow calling OpenCV incorrectly. This bug occurred infrequently and was hard to diagnose. In order to deal with this, we developed a high throughput request simulator that provided image URLs that linked to an HTTP server within the simulator, so that the simulator would act both as requesting client and hosting server. The simulator randomly delayed its responses in order to provoke this strange image corrupting behavior from Media Proxy. With a reliable reproduction, we were able to isolate components in Media Proxy until we discovered a race condition on the output buffer that contained the resized image. We had been writing one image to this buffer and then writing another to the same buffer before the first had finished being put back on the network. The glitched images we had seen were actually two JPEGs written on top of one another. Another way to discover bugs in a complex system is fuzzing, which is a technique that generates random inputs and sends them into a system. This can cause the system to exhibit strange behavior or crash, and since our system needs to be resilient against all inputs, we decided to utilize this important technique while testing. AFL is an exceptionally good fuzzer , so we picked it and ran it against Lilliput, which revealed several crashes due to uninitialized variables. After fixing the above bugs, we were confident enough to ship Media Proxy to production and were happy to find that our work had paid off. Media Proxy needed 60% fewer server instances to handle as many requests as Image Proxy while completing requests with much less variance in latency. Profiling shows that more than 90% of CPU time in this new service is spent performing image decompression, resizing, and compression. These libraries are already highly optimized, suggesting further gains would not be easily achievable. Additionally, the service creates almost no garbage at runtime. Today, Media Proxy operates with a median per-image resize of 25ms and a median total response latency of 85ms. It resizes more than 150 million images every day. Media Proxy runs on an autoscaled GCE group of n1-standard-16 host type , peaking at 12 instances on a typical day. After we had static images working, we wanted to support animated GIF resizing as well, which OpenCV would not handle for us. We decided to add another Cgo wrapper on top of giflib to Lilliput so that it could resize full GIFs, as well as output the first frame as PNG. Resizing GIFs turned out to be somewhat challenging as the GIF standard specifies per-frame palettes of 256 colors, but the resizer operates in RGB space . We decided to preserve each frame’s palette rather than attempting to recompute new palettes. In order to convert RGB back into palette indices, we gave Lilliput a simple lookup table that crushes some of the RGB bits and uses the result as a key into a palette index table. This performs well and preserves the original colors, though it does mean that Lilliput can only create a GIF from a source GIF. We also patched giflib so that it would be easier to decode just a single frame at a time. This allows us to decode one frame, resize it, and then encode and compress it before moving on to the next, reducing the memory footprint of the GIF resizer. This does add some complexity to Lilliput as it must preserve some GIF state from frame to frame, but having more predictable memory usage in Media Proxy seems like a clear advantage. Lilliput’s giflib wrapper fixed a number of issues we had previously seen in Image Proxy’s GIF resizing as giflib gave us full control of the image resizing process. A significant number of our Nitro users had uploaded animated GIF avatars which would have glitches or transparency errors when resized by the Image Proxy but which worked perfectly through Media Proxy. In general, we found that image resizers had problems with some aspects of the GIF format and produced visual glitches for frames with transparency or partial frames. Creating our own wrapper allows us to address these issues as we encounter them. Finally, we gave Lilliput a Cgo wrapper on libavcodec so that it could freeze the first frame from MP4 and WEBM videos. This functionality will allow Media Proxy to give previews of user posted videos so that users can decide from the preview whether they want to play the video. Freezing the first frame of videos was one of the remaining blockers for us to add an in-client video player for videos in message attachments and links. Now that we’re satisfied with Media Proxy, we’re releasing Lilliput under MIT license. We hope that this package will be useful for anybody who needs a performant image resizing service, and that this post will help others build new Go packages. We are hiring, so come join us if this type of stuff tickles your fancy.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "verified servers and how to promote them", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/verified-servers-and-how-to-promote-them-4be8d23d86f0", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com If you’re reading this, you are probably a game developer or publisher interested in our Verified Server program! Not a game developer or publisher? Don’t worry — Verified Servers allow you to see which servers are officially verified and being run by your fave game developer or publisher. Edit: 2.1.2018, 6:28 PM PST — We’re now accepting music artists and labels into our Verified Server program! We’ve heard from players and game developers alike that they would love to easily indicate where to get official news, support, or dialogue for their favorite game on Discord — so we built a way for players to see which servers are verified by Discord and the developers themselves. Super-fans know they are in the right place by spotting the checkbox in the game server profile. For you game developers, Verified Servers receive a few perks to help promote your server including VIP voice servers and custom branding for your discord.gg link and welcome splash page. So, the next logical question is: how do I apply? First, make sure you meet the criteria below: Your server is owned and managed by a game publisher and/or developer You are prepared to implement our server requirements You are committed to follow our community guidelines and ToS If that all sounds peachy, hop on over to the site to read more and apply for a Verified Server here . Now that you’re officially verified, the next great challenge is: how can you spread all the hype and good news to the ends of the earth, and let all your fans know where to find your officially official Discord server? There are many different paths that game publishers and developers take to rise up to the challenge — from sharing their invites on various social platforms, showcasing their server in-game, or even just directly plugging a link on their own official websites. We think it makes sense to promote it everywhere you believe your community goes to learn about your game or communicate with your team. Take a look at our branding guidelines for assets you’ll need to get the job done and consider stylizing your custom splash page to match any of your player destinations to create a consistent experience when navigating from your properties to your now totally official VERIFIED DISCORD SERVER!! Here are some examples below. YouTube : We mocked up Pocket Watch to show what it might look like in YouTube. They also wrote an excellent guest post on community for game devs if interested in learning more. Twitter : Simple pinned tweet gets you instant promo, and will look even slicker with that custom discord.gg link. Website : Now being a little selfish we think Discord should be in a different spot here (cough, FIRST, cough…) but the blurple really does pop don’t it? In game : Adding Discord directly to game menus is one of the best ways to get the word out to all your players. And that’s the scoop! If you want to stay in touch on all the latest Discord tools and tips for game creators, sign up for our handy-dandy newsletter here! Now go forth and have fun with your community!…..(∩✧ᗜ✧)⊃━☆ﾟ.* Imagine a Place 3.7K 10 Verification Verified Servers Discordapp Discord Social Media 3.7K claps 3.7K 10 Written by Chief Robot Hamster.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "lessons from migrating a large codebase to react 16", "author": ["Michael Greer"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/lessons-from-migrating-a-large-codebase-to-react-16-e60e49102aa6", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Facebook released a rewrite of a large portion of React last week. React 16 has been much anticipated, and the new Fiber rendering pipeline allows for a lot of performance improvements. While the React team has diligently deprecated methods and packages throughout the last version, warning us strongly in console statements to upgrade, the actual final migration is not trivial for larger codebases. We at Discord just launched our React 16 based app and wanted to share our experience and some tips we learned along the way. The architectural direction of Fiber looks like it could eventually be a much smoother user experience for both DOM and Native renderers by chunking up the render and prioritizing quicker bits first. Right now, it isn’t clear that the advantages are significant (for one, asynchronous rendering is not enabled yet), but the changes pave the path for such gains in the future. You are going to need to upgrade eventually. React is still in motion, and to stay behind will surely leave you fixing against bugs long abandoned by the 16+ community. Also, the new ErrorBoundary is a great addition. There are a lot of changes, and you will need to adapt. Like all migrations, the level of pain will be directly correlated to how recent most of your codebase is. Facebook has done a good job of deprecating and warning for the last few months, but not all libraries are well-maintained and if you depend on or have forked a great many ancient ones, you will be in for a bit of a slog. It is also up to you and your team whether this is the time to finally move to ES6 classes everywhere, or functional components, or what have you. We strongly recommend doing that after you successfully migrate, so you can understand what is breaking (and ideally covering with tests) before making it beautifully modern. Also, you will want to do this migration as quickly as possible so that you can quickly start testing and then deploying your branch. Having this sit out on a PR for a few weeks will allow master to move past you to the point that you will need to do it again. We were starting with a good quality codebase, but one that is big enough to have not migrated off of mixins and React.createClass in the majority of components. We also pin to specific package versions, which means we are stable and confident, but our dependencies can become old and mossy. This is where the pain came. First and foremost, you should use the Facebook codemod to move from React.PropTypes to prop-types, and to migrate off of React.createClass. The codemod will make pretty wise choices, moving you to a class if possible (and a PureComponent class if you use the pure mixin), or shimming it with create-react-class. Install jscodeshift , and then clone the react-codemod repo. Then run the following against your codebase: Move to prop-types package: Move to Component, PureComponent, or createReactClass: The latter is doing a lot of things, well described on the github page . Most importantly: Moves to an ES6 class if no mixins, and PureComponent if only the pure mixin is present. If a class is created, all static are migrated. Creates flow annotations from propTypes. Migrates method binding from constructor to arrow functions, if you like that sort of thing. Skips any component using deprecated APIs like isMounted() etc. The codemod found a number of errors in our codebase, which you should note and then go through and correct by hand. If you do not like their codemod, or decisions, you should absolutely modify it to your taste or write your own. The codemod is an excellent tool, but not a magic wand. This alone will not migrate you! We found that we had to search and replace a number of spots where the the codemod missed it. Spots where we had imported PropTypes from React and called it directly, perhaps. The biggest manual adjustment for us was hunting down all of the isMounted() calls and instead creating a property _isMounted which is set to true inside componentDidMount, and false inside componentWillUnmount ( although maybe you shouldn’t ). Surely you don’t use private APIs from inside React? The ones from react/lib/* . If you do, the devs at Facebook have no pity for you: they have bricked you out of those. Some of these have been moved to external libraries (the ‘react-addons-’ family of packages) but in some cases, they are just gone. Our code has a custom TransitionGroup which depended on the flattenChildren function from inside react/lib. But this function is now gone, as are the related childMapping and mergeChildMappings functions. React devs recommend “inlining” (ie, copy-and-pasting) the required functions, which is what we eventually did. However, we inlined the newer versions of those functions from inside react-transition. Discovering this issue, and resolving it, was the first big hurdle, but our app still did not yet run. This one is tedious, and if you are not in a rush to get on 16 might be worth waiting until more libraries test and upgrade themselves. If you wish to help in that process, however, it will help everyone. The console will keep warning you about packages that call React.PropTypes or use React.createClass. You will need to upgrade these if possible, replace or work around them if necessary, or fork and fix them if the package seems unmaintained. The main issues you are looking to solve for are: Uses React.PropTypes Uses React.createClass Depends directly on pre-React 16 internals Number 3 will lead to an error about ref ownership, and there being more than one React package. Search your yarn.lock for who is depending directly on React < 16 (they should be using a peer dependency!), and upgrade those first. But not all package errors are so easily discovered, and herein lies the real pain. We ran into an error which took us 2 days to track down to a library, and you may find the same. The console kept telling us that reactFiberChild could not render an element because its ref was undefined. We tore our hair out puzzling through how this could happen, and eventually dug into the React code and saw where the error was being generated. React 16 doesn’t like undefined ref attributes, but null are fine. It took us a while to discover that elements created with a core external library were being set with ref: undefined. Once we forked and fixed it, everything rendered beautifully. Well, we also found that there were subtle errors here and there throughout the code, again mostly those which required moving through dependent libraries and upgrading or fixing them. Often upgrading a library that is fairly old will alter its rendering, blowing out your carefully crafted CSS overrides. Since most libraries have only fixed their issues once the deprecation warnings showed up in React 15.5+, only their most recent version will work. This is tedious work to discover and fix. Moving to ES6 classes for React 16 means that you now need to be fastidious about not altering props. Where you previously got a warning about this, now it fails hard with a “Cannot assign to read only property XXX of object ‘#<XXXX>’”. If you destructure props, and try to alter those properties (or properties on those objects), this will bite you. Instead assign a new object with the updated value: Also, React 16 will warn about getting a boolean onClick value, which can happen if you do onClick={!disabled && this.handleOnClick} . Handle the disabled state inside the function to resolve. We also have an iOS app which shares stores, utils, and some action creators with the web app. Migrating to React 16 was in some ways motivated by our heavy use of React Native, as newer RN releases depend on the alphas of React 16. Unfortunately, because we need some special timers for video, we have a fork of React Native and have been back on 0.34. React 16 compatibility only arrived in RN in 0.48.0, so it is time to migrate… We found this to be especially painful. The biggest headache was that we used React Native Webpack Server to be able to reuse code between our projects, and this project was abandoned a year ago (very hard to constantly shadow the RN codebase). So we needed to look at our build tooling, and began to migrate to Haul . Haul keeps us in the webpack universe, but was not trivial to setup in an existing codebase. That would perhaps be the subject of another post. Also, we have been importing iOS images using the webpack-y require(‘image!image_src’) , which was no longer possible in newer versions of RN. This was grueling work, since we had to move the image assets and change how we accessed them (by importing the images directly and referencing the import). Even after writing a codemod, this was mostly manual. The rest of the React Native migration was achieved by making a list of breaking changes from all of the intermediate RN change logs, and going through them one by one. For instance, the behavior of flex styling was (properly) changed, and as a result our usage had to be adjusted throughout the app. This was painstaking, but the most efficient path. You will also find many classes have been deprecated. For now, we suggest you use the shim react-native-deprecated-custom-components . You may need the latest commit, since they only recently updated it for React 16. The best bit for us was the new ErrorBoundary . Since React 16 now aborts the render tree on an uncaught error (which is a good thing), you’ll want to put something to render to the user when this happens. Additionally, the boundaries provide a great opportunity to have a central location for logging information-rich errors with both stack and component traces. So now it renders, and your user experience is full of wonder and delight. No? We found it to be no faster than React 15, but expect this to change as we and the core devs pursue the advantages inherent in the new architecture. The biggest advantage, like most tech debt payments, will come down the road. Our code has now been forcibly brought up to date, and this allowed us to normalize much of the code style en passant while reconsidering some of the core tooling for immediate or subsequent modernization. Performance is a bonus. We are hiring, so come join us if this type of stuff tickles your fancy. Imagine a Place 4.98K 14 Thanks to Paul Shen .

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission is proposing to roll back the 2015 Title 2 Classification laws for internet service providers (ISPs) which provides the legal groundwork for treating all internet traffic as equal. Small startups like Discord depend on this law for fair access to fast and low latency internet pipes in order to compete with large incumbent companies. While government regulation is something to be careful about, ISPs in the US are effectively local monopolies. This market position gives them the power to use predatory business practices such as throttling internet packets unless they’re paid. This has happened before the 2015 laws were enacted and will likely happen again should Title 2 be rolled back. Each month, Discord moves about 17 petabytes of voice data around the internet. This will grow a lot more with video chat and screen sharing ( Update: the numbers grew a lot more with video chat and screen sharing. ) If we were required to pay an ISP for low latency and non-throttled access to the internet, Discord would probably not exist today. Continuing to offer incredibly high quality service depends on spending our resources to improve our service and not paying a “tax” to ISPs to do so. If you want to prevent large monopolistic ISPs from predatory behavior, you should support the Net Neutrality laws that are currently in effect. The FCC is voting to repeal Net Neutrality on Dec. 14th 2017. Please support Net Neutrality by calling your local congressman and voicing your support. Check out battleforthenet.com for direction.

Update 8/17/2017 2:33 PM PST: We’ve now rolled out video chat to 10% of players, all Discord Partners, and all Discord Nitro subscribers (yes, buying Nitro will get you beta access). It’s real. It’s kick-flip and-a-sodie-pop real. Starting today, we will be testing out Video Chat and Screen Sharing with 5% of desktop players (registered before today). This will roll out through the day. Why do we need a test run? Two reasons: Compared to voice data, video data is a behemoth and transmitting it across the intertubes takes way more bandwidth. We’re doing this test to see how our servers handle the increase in bandwidth (alternatively, we could launch it for everybody today and most likely nuke our own servers and then nobody gets to use it. Riveting)! There’s likely bugs, crashes, and other issues that we’ve been unable to catch ourselves. We want to iron as much as we can before launching to everybody. We’re suckers for quality and want to make sure we end up launching the most polished experience we can. Public use gives us a lot of data and feedback to work with so we can accelerate to a full launch. One of the lucky few? Here’s two things you need to know: You’ll be able to start video calls with anybody. Yes — that means you can start a call with your friends who didn’t land a critical roll. It’s possible that we’ll need to completely turn off video calls during this test. If you find the feature is missing all of a sudden, we suggest you lay on the floor and stare at the ceiling until it’s fixed. We’re still at least a month out from considering a full launch. Why? We’re measuring and testing bandwidth; acquiring and implementing more backend servers; and praying our code actually works. This takes time. It could also be longer than a month. What we do know is that it’s good enough to start testing and this is the most soon soon that we’ve ever sooned. For now, video chat and screen share are only available in one on one calls and group DMs (not servers). This does mean you can have up to ten people using this feature at once in a call (although you may experience reduced quality after five people). Once you got the call going, select the video option to show your face parts over the web. Alternatively, select the screen share option to send your screen pixels. Basically, the source can come from your webcam or your screen and you can flip between them seamlessly during a call. While video chatting, you can select one of three views for your arrangement pleasure. And of course you can full screen for maximum pixel digestion. It ain’t the internet without true multi-tasking. If you click away from a group DM during any video call, the main feed will hover on Discord so you can view while roaming your servers and other DMs. You can dock the hovering magical window on any corner in the app. Thanks for your patience as we develop this feature. If you’re part of the initial rollout, please submit any bumps, bugs, and bruises to us so we can get those fixed. We’re just as excited as you are to finally get this thing into your grasping claws.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "scaling elixir", "author": ["Stanislav Vishnevskiy"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/scaling-elixir-f9b8e1e7c29b", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com From the beginning, Discord has been an early adopter of Elixir. The Erlang VM was the perfect candidate for the highly concurrent, real-time system we were aiming to build. We developed the original prototype of Discord in Elixir; that became the foundation of our infrastructure today. Elixir’s promise was simple: access the power of the Erlang VM through a much more modern and user-friendly language and toolset. Fast forward two years, and we are up to nearly five million concurrent users and millions of events per second flowing through the system. While we don’t have any regrets with our choice of infrastructure, we did have to do a lot of research and experimentation to get here. Elixir is a new ecosystem, and the Erlang ecosystem lacks information about using it in production (although Erlang in Anger is awesome). What follows is a set of lessons learned and libraries created throughout our journey of making Elixir work for Discord. While Discord is rich with features, most of it boils down to pub/sub. Users connect to a WebSocket and spin up a session process (a GenServer), which then communicates with remote Erlang nodes that contain guild (internal for a “Discord Server”) processes (also GenServers). When anything is published in a guild, it is fanned out to every session connected to it. When a user comes online, they connect to a guild, and the guild publishes a presence to all other connected sessions. Guilds have a lot of other logic behind the scenes, but here’s a simplified example: This was a fine approach when we originally built Discord to groups of 25 of less. However, we have been fortunate enough to have “good problems” arise as people started using Discord for large scale groups . Eventually we ended up with many Discord servers like /r/Overwatch with up to 30,000 concurrent users. During peak hours, we began to see these processes fail to keep up with their message queues. At a certain point, we had to manually intervene and turn off features that generated messages to help cope with the load. We had to figure this out before it became a full-time job. We began by benchmarking hot paths within the guild processes and quickly stumbled onto an obvious culprit. Sending messages between Erlang processes was not as cheap as we expected, and the reduction cost — Erlang unit of work used for process scheduling — was also quite high. We found that the wall clock time of a single send/2 call could range from 30μs to 70us due to Erlang de-scheduling the calling process. This meant that during peak hours, publishing an event from a large guild could take anywhere from 900ms to 2.1s! Erlang processes are effectively single threaded, and the only way to parallelize the work is to shard them. That would have been quite an undertaking, and we knew there had to be a better way. We knew we had to somehow distribute the work of sending messages. Since spawning processes in Erlang is cheap, our first guess was to just spawn another process to handle each publish. However, each publish could be scheduled at a different time, and Discord clients depend on linearizability of events. That solution also wouldn’t scale well because the guild service was also responsible for an ever-growing amount of work. Inspired by a blog post about boosting performance of message passing between nodes, Manifold was born. Manifold distributes the work of sending messages to the remote nodes of the PIDs (Erlang process identifier), which guarantees that the sending processes at most only calls send/2 equal to the number of involved remote nodes. Manifold does this by first grouping PIDs by their remote node and then sending to Manifold.Partitioner on each of those nodes. The partitioner then consistently hashes the PIDs using :erlang.phash2/2 , groups them by number of cores, and sends them to child workers. Finally, those workers send the messages to the actual processes. This ensures the partitioner does not get overloaded and still provides the linearizability guaranteed by send/2 . This solution was effectively a drop-in replacement for send/2 : An awesome side-effect of Manifold was that we were able to not only distribute the CPU cost of fanning out messages, but also reduce the network traffic between nodes: Manifold is available on our GitHub, so give it a spin. https://github.com/discordapp/manifold . Discord is a distributed system achieved through consistent hashing . Using this method requires us to create a ring data structure that can be used to lookup the node of a particular entity. We want that to be fast, so we chose the wonderful library by Chris Moos via a Erlang C port (process responsible for interfacing with C code). It worked great for us, but as Discord scaled, we started to notice issues when we had bursts of users reconnecting. The Erlang process responsible for controlling the ring would start to get so busy that it would fail to keep up with requests to the ring, and the whole system would become overloaded. The solution at first seemed obvious: run multiple processes with the ring data to better utilize all the machine’s cores to answer the requests. However, we noticed that this was a hot path. Could we do better? Let’s break down the cost of this hot path. A user can be in any number of guilds, but an average user is in 5. An Erlang VM responsible for sessions can have up to 500,000 live sessions on it. When a session connects, it has to lookup the remote node for each guild it is interested in. The cost of communicating with another Erlang process using request/reply is about 12μs. If the session server were to crash and restart, it would take about 30 seconds just for the cost of lookups on the ring. That does not even account for Erlang de-scheduling the single process involved in the ring for other processes’ work. Could we remove this cost completely? The first thing people do in Elixir when they want to speed up data access is to introduce ETS . ETS is a fast, mutable dictionary implemented in C; the tradeoff is that data is copied in and out of it. We couldn’t just move our ring into ETS because we were using a C port to control the ring, so we converted the code to pure Elixir . Once that was implemented, we had a process whose job was to own the ring and constantly copy it into ETS so other processes could read directly from ETS. This noticeably improved performance, but ETS reads were about 7μs, and we were still spending 17.5 seconds on looking up values in the ring. The ring data structure is actually fairly large, and copying it in and out of ETS was the majority of the cost. We were disappointed; in any other language we could easily just have a shared value that was safe to read. There had to be a way to do this in Erlang! After doing some research, we found mochiglobal , a module that exploits a feature of the VM: if Erlang sees a function that always returns the same constant data, it puts that data into a read-only shared heap that processes can access without copying the data. mochiglobal takes advantage of this by creating an Erlang module with one function at runtime and compiling it. Since the data is never copied, the lookup cost decreases to 0.3us, bringing the total time down to 750ms ! There’s no such thing as a free lunch though; the cost of building a module with a data structure as large as the ring at runtime can take up to a second. The good news is that we rarely change the ring, so it was a penalty we were willing to take. We decided to port mochiglobal to Elixir and add some functionality to avoid creating atoms. Our version is called FastGlobal and is available at https://github.com/discordapp/fastglobal . After solving the performance of the node lookup hot path, we noticed that the processes responsible for handling guild_pid lookup on the guild nodes were getting backed up. The inherent back pressure of the slow node lookup had previously protected these processes. The new problem was that nearly 5,000,000 session processes were trying to stampede ten of these processes (one on each guild node). Making this path faster wouldn’t solve the problem; the underlying issue was that the call of a session process to this guild registry would timeout and leave the request in the queue of the guild registry. It would then retry the request after a backoff, but perpetually pile up requests and get into an unrecoverable state. Sessions would block on these requests until they timed out while receiving messages from other services, causing them to balloon their message queues and eventually OOM the whole Erlang VM resulting in cascading service outages . We needed to make session processes smarter; ideally, they wouldn’t even try to make these calls to the guild registry if a failure was inevitable. We didn’t want to use a circuit breaker because we didn’t want a burst in timeouts to result in a temporary state where no attempts are made at all. We knew how we would solve this in other languages, but how would we solve it in Elixir? In most other languages, we could use an atomic counter to track outstanding requests and bail early if the number was too high, effectively implementing a semaphore. The Erlang VM is built around coordinating through communication between processes, but we knew we didn’t want to overload a process responsible for doing this coordination. After some research we stumbled upon :ets.update_counter/4 , which performs atomic conditional increment operations on a number inside an ETS key. Since we needed high concurrency, we could also run ETS in write_concurrency mode but still read the value out, since :ets.update_counter/4 returns the result. This gave us the fundamental piece to create our Semaphore library. It is extremely easy to use and performs really well at high throughput: This library has proved instrumental in protecting our Elixir infrastructure. A similar situation to the aforementioned cascading outages occurred as recently as last week, but there were no outages this time. Our presence services crashed due to an unrelated issue, but the session services did not even budge, and the presence services were able to rebuild within minutes after restarting: You can find our Semaphore library on GitHub at https://github.com/discordapp/semaphore . Choosing to use and getting familiar with Erlang and Elixir has proven to be a great experience. If we had to go back and start over, we would definitely choose the same path. We hope that sharing our experiences and tools proves useful to other Elixir and Erlang developers, and we hope to continue sharing as we progress on our journey, solving problems and learning lessons along the way.

The report button has been rolled back and is on indefinite hold while we figure out how to best implement it. We’ve removed content concerning the report button from this article. A long long roughly two years ago, in May 2015, Discord began as a way for us to all play games together, better. And safer. Turns out, a lot of other people found it useful too. As Discord grew, large communities started to adopt Discord as a home. It was simultaneously surprising and amazing to see groups like /r/LeagueOfLegends create servers so people could talk together about something they love. Fast forward to today, and Discord is now over 25m users strong. Unfortunately, with all this growth and popularity, Discord has also seen some baddies show up and mess with the fun we’re having. We’ve always wanted Discord to be a place where one could safely play games with friends. Our foundation is built on security (client-server technology which hides everyone’s IP and prevents individual DDOS attacks). We’ve also implemented various security features to help users maintain safety. This includes things like IP Location Lock, Two-Factor Authentication , Streamer Mode , File Warnings, Virus Scanning , Verification Levels , and our unreal CX team which handles inflammatory events with insane response times. To further fight the baddies, we are upgrading our security starting today. You’re going to see a bunch of little tools and tricks added to the Discord experience as part of our quest to continuously improve safety and security for all you amazing people (note that the features may change marginally before they’re live). In fact, today we’ll be adding Safe Direct Messaging, a Global DM Privacy setting, and our spoopy link filter to DMs. By default, Discord allows any two people who share a server to direct message each other. Unfortunately, the baddies can use this behavior to send you stuff that you don’t want to see — everything from Harry Potter spoiler memes (Snape killed who!??) to much worse. To keep the baddies at bay, we’re adding Safe Direct Messaging. Images you receive in a DM from a non-friend will be automatically scanned by our robo-hamsters using fancy machine learning . Any flagged images will be deleted. As seen in the image above, you have the option to turn off Safe Direct Messaging for your account under the User Settings > Privacy tab. Now, go finish Harry Potter because that twist is nutty. Want to turn off direct messages from all strangers? Previously, you had to do this server by server. We’re adding a handy dandy one-click global option so you can set whether or not you want DMs from non-friends. Don’t fret, Bret. If you want to, you will still be able to override the global setting on a per-server basis. When you click on a link from a non-friend in a DM, we’ll pop up a quick reminder that the internet is a bit spoopy. This is similar behavior to how masked links already work in Discord — we’re now bringing it to DMs for that double safety dip. — That’s a good start but we can kick it up a couple more notches. Other upcoming safety features include: Table flip supreme. This new optional enhanced verification level will require people in the server to have a verified phone number on their account to send messages (including DMs). The bonus for this feature is that server bans will now ban baddies by phone number in addition to IP Address making their baddie lives even baddier. To tackle the baddies at any time, all the time, we will be exposing the same fancy machine learning used in Safe Direct Messaging but in servers. Turning on Explicit Content Filtering will automatically detect and delete images and uploads deemed inappropriate. By default, this will be off for all existing servers. To enable this, simply check the Explicit Content Filtering option in server settings. Update 3/28/17 9:54pm PDT: We initially wrote “Discord Partner servers will have this turned on automatically.” After reconsidering our approach, we’ve decided to make this optional for partners as well. We genuinely care what you think, so thank you for keeping this a conversation. — We come to work every day — we get out of bed BEFORE 10 AM — because we want to provide a safe and high quality place for you to game with your friends and we will keep striving for that goal.

Furthermore, we’ve added clarification to the Community Guidelines. Previously, in March, we announced a round of safety improvements as part of our quest to keep Discord a safe place to play games with your friends. A long long roughly two years ago, in May 2015, Discord began as a way for us to all play games together, better. And safer. Turns out, a lot of other people found it useful too.

Fast forward to today, and Discord is now over 25m users strong. Unfortunately, with all this growth and popularity, Discord has also seen some baddies show up and mess with the fun we’re having. As a continuation of this effort, we’re launching a new NSFW channel feature. Secondly, we’ve also updated our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for better clarity. Lasterino, we’ve developed a set of Community Guidelines to clearly state what sort of content and behavior is and isn’t acceptable in Discord. Our philosophy is to empower each of you with tools to curate your own safety level on Discord. If you don’t wanna stumble across inappropriate content, you shouldn’t. The changes below help achieve this goal as well as add clarity to what content we do find objectionable. Instead of ham-fisting all NSFW content into the trash, server admins can now set any channel as NSFW in channel settings (which prefixes that channel). #dirtymemes becomes #nsfw-dirtymemes. Channels that intend to share NSFW content must be marked. This gives people the choice to opt-out ahead of time from seeing content that their boss would be upset about. In order to set a standard of safety for each and every Discord user, we’ve developed a set of Community Guidelines . These guidelines state what kind of behavior and content is acceptable in Discord servers (and in turn, how we will respond to reported content). Consider it the law of the land — when a baddie comes in trying to bring badness, we can defer to the law and deliver justice. Similarly, when someone sends us a report, the action we take is mostly determined by the Community Guidelines. In certain no-tolerance cases, this results in an account deletion and removal of reported content (sharing illegal content, for example). In less severe instances, accounts will be warned before receiving any punishment (which may include a temporary account suspension). In non-legally-binding summary, don’t be an ass. Easy, right? :) We also had some housekeeping to do to make sure our Terms of Service is up to date (like including some language for Discord Nitro, which didn’t exist previously). Specifically, we now reference the Community Guidelines in our Terms of Service. Language has been added around payment (as mentioned above, due to Nitro). And… that’s pretty much it. Our Privacy Policy got altered a little bit more than these terms, so let’s dig into that. Much like our Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy underwent some housekeeping. The following is a non-legally-binding summary of the changes, mostly: First, we added a specific note about Transient Voice Data (stuff we need to transmit data, not literal audio content) and how we use it to run our service. We added a section on Cookies — again, for how we use them to run our service as well as instructions about how to turn them off (in some cases) and how to bake the finest chocolate chip cookies ever. Oh wait, the lawyers made us remove that last bit :( The Advertisement section is added. Calm down it’s not what you think DEEP BREATH. Specifically, this section states that we do not run ads in Discord. However, it details that we do run ads FOR Discord on other services. Doing this requires some data but if you’d like you can opt out through programs listed in the policy. A section was added about developers using our SDK and API. It specifies that they are only allowed to use their end user’s information to provide functionality within their applications or service. Finally, you gotta be 13 to use Discord. Sorry tweens. — If you’d like to sink your teeth into the full text, check out the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Unfortunately, there’s a microscopic chance that a bug in Cloudflare, one of our service providers, leaked sensitive Discord data including passwords. Double unfortunately, this is affecting a lot of companies who use Cloudflare to keep you guys safe from the bad guys. If you want the longer version from our grandmaster code slinger aka our Chief Technical Officer aka Stan, read the message below. Moreover, if you forgot how to change your password, here’s how. Cloudflare disclosed today that they have fixed a bug reported by Google’s Project Zero that was very rarely exposing sensitive information in random requests (0.00003% of all requests) since September 2016. There was no way to target specific information and the exposed information was random. For those that are unaware Cloudflare is an internet proxy that protects website from malicious attacks such as DDoS. Discord and many other websites were affected by this vulnerability. You can find a full list of websites that are using Cloudflare here . The likelihood that your information was leaked on any of these sites is very low, but we highly recommend changing your password on Discord and any other sites you use that also use Cloudflare. If you develop against the API on any of the sites, it is also recommended to reset your API key. At the current time we do not believe performing a forced password reset on all of Discord is necessary given the incredibly low likelihood of impact, but we are continuing to evaluate as we wait for Cloudflare to provide us directly with the full level of impact. Stay safe on the internet! — UPDATE Feb 24, 2017: As the dust settles, its worth noting that Reddit is not affected .

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord indexes billions of messages", "author": ["Jake Heinz"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-indexes-billions-of-messages-e3d5e9be866f", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Millions of users send billions of messages on Discord every month . A way to search this history quickly became one of the most requested features we built. Let there be search! Cost Effective: The core user experience on Discord is our text and voice chat. Search is an accessory feature, and the price of the infrastructure needed to reflect that. Ideally this means search shouldn’t cost more than the actual storage of messages. Fast & Intuitive: All the features we build need to be fast and intuitive, including search. The search experience in our product needed to look and feel awesome to use too. Self-healing: We don’t have a dedicated devops team (yet), so search needed to be able to tolerate failures with minimal to no operator intervention. Linearly Scalable: Just like how we store messages, increasing the capacity of our search infrastructure should involve adding more nodes . Lazily Indexed: Not everyone uses search — we shouldn’t index messages unless someone attempts to search them at least once. Additionally, if an index fails, we needed to be able to re-index servers on the fly. In looking at these requirements, we asked ourselves two key questions: Q. Could we outsource search to a managed SaaS? (easymode) A. Nope. Every solution we looked at that did managed search would have blown our budget (by an astronomically high margin) for this feature. Additionally, the thought of shipping messages out of our datacenter did not sit well with the team. As a security conscious team, we wanted to be in control of the security of users’ messages, not trusting a third party to know what they are doing. Q. Is there an open source solution to search that we can use? A. Yeah! We looked around and the conversation internally quickly came to Elasticsearch vs Solr, as both could be an appropriate fit for our use case. Elasticsearch had the edge: Node discovery on Solr requires ZooKeeper. We run etcd, and did not want to have additional infrastructure specifically for Solr. Elasticsearch’s Zen Discovery is self contained. Elasticsearch supports automatic shard rebalancing, which would let us add new nodes to the cluster, fulfilling the linearly scalable requirement out of the box. Elasticsearch has a structured query DSL built-in, whereas you’d have to programmatically create a query string with Solr using a third party library. Engineers on the team had more experience working with Elasticsearch Elasticsearch seemed to have everything we wanted and our engineers had experience working with it in the past. It provided a way to replicate data across different nodes to tolerate the failure of a single node, scale up the cluster by adding more nodes, and could ingest messages to be indexed without breaking a sweat. Reading around, we heard some horror stories about managing large Elasticsearch clusters, and really none of our backend team had any experience with managing Elasticsearch clusters apart from our logging infrastructure. We wanted to avoid these cumbersome, large clusters, so we came up with the idea to delegate sharding and routing to the application layer, allowing us to index messages into a pool of smaller Elasticsearch clusters. This meant that in the event of a cluster outage only Discord messages contained on the affected cluster would be unavailable for searching. This also gave us the advantage of being able to throw away an entire cluster’s data should it become unrecoverable (the system is able to lazily re-index the Discord server the next time a user performs a search). Elasticsearch likes it when documents are indexed in bulk . This meant that we couldn’t index messages as they were being posted in real time. Instead, we designed a queue in which a worker grabs a bunch of messages and indexes them within in a single bulk operation. We decided that this small delay between when a message was posted and when it became searchable was a perfectly reasonable constraint. After all, most users search for messages said historically, not something just said. On the ingest side, we needed a few things: Message Queue : We needed a queue that we can put messages into as they are posted in real time (to be consumed by a pool of workers). Index Workers : Workers that do the actual routing and bulk inserts into Elasticsearch from the queue. We built a task queuing system on top of Celery already, so we leveraged it also for our historical index workers. Historical Index Workers : Workers responsible for iterating through the message history in a given server and inserting them into the Elasticsearch index. We also needed a quick and easy mapping of which Elasticsearch cluster and index a Discord server’s messages would reside on. We call this “cluster + index” pair a Shard (not to be confused with Elasticsearch’s native shards within an index). The mapping we created comes in two layers: Persistent Shard Mapping : We put this on Cassandra, our primary data store for persistent data, as the source of truth. Shard Mapping Cache : When we’re ingesting messages on our workers, querying Cassandra for a Shard is a slow operation. We cache these mappings in Redis, so that we can do mget operations to quickly figure out where a message needs to be routed to. When a server is being indexed for the first time, we also needed a way to select which Shard to hold a Discord server’s messages on. Since our Shards are an application layered abstraction, we can be a bit smart about how to allocate them. By harnessing the power of Redis, we used a sorted set to build a load aware shard allocator. Shard Allocator : Using a sorted set in Redis we keep a set of the Shards with a score that represents their load. The Shard with the lowest score is the shard that should be allocated next. The score gets incremented with each new allocation, and each message that is indexed in Elasticsearch has a probability to increment the score of its Shard too. As Shards get more data in them they have a less likely chance of being allocated to a new Discord server. Of course, this entire search infrastructure would be incomplete without a way to discover clusters and the hosts within them from the application layer. etcd: We use etcd for service discovery in other parts of our system, so we also used it for our Elasticsearch clusters. Since nodes in a cluster can announce themselves onto etcd for the rest of the system to see, we don’t have to hardcode any Elasticsearch topologies. Finally, we needed a way for clients to be able to actually search things. Search API : An API endpoint that clients can issue search queries to. It needed to do all the permission checks to make sure that clients are only searching messages they actually have access to. At a really high level, in Elasticsearch, we have the concept of an “index,” containing a number of “shards” within it. A shard in this case is actually a Lucene index . Elasticsearch is responsible for distributing the data within an index to a shard belonging to that index. If you want, you can control how the data is distributed amongst the shards by using a “routing key.” An index can also contain a “replication factor,” which is how many nodes an index (and its shards within) should be replicated to. If the node that the index is on fails a replica can take over (Unrelated but related, these replicas can also serve search queries, so you can scale the search throughput of the index by adding more replicas). Since we handed all of the sharding logic in the application level (our Shards), having Elasticsearch do the sharding for us didn’t really make sense. However, we could use it to do replication and balancing of the indices between nodes in the cluster. In order to have Elasticsearch automatically create an index using the correct configuration, we used an index template, which contained the index configuration and data mapping. The index configuration was pretty simple: The index should only contain one shard (don’t do any sharding for us) The index should be replicated to one node (be able to tolerate the failure of the primary node the index is on) The index should only refresh once every 60 minutes (why we had to do this is explained below). The index contains a single document type: message Storing the raw message data in Elasticsearch made little sense as the data was not in a format that was easily searchable. Instead, we decided to take each message, and transform it into a bunch of fields containing metadata about the message that we can index and search on: You’ll notice that we didn’t include timestamp in these fields, and if you recall from our previous blog post , our IDs are Snowflakes , which means they inherently contain a timestamp (which we can use to power before, on, and after queries by using a minimum and maximum ID range). These fields however aren’t actually “stored” in Elasticsearch, rather, they are only stored in the inverted index . The only fields that are actually stored and returned are the message, channel and server ID that the message was posted in. This means that message data is not duplicated in Elasticsearch. The tradeoff being that we’ll have to fetch the message from Cassandra when returning search results, which is perfectly okay, because we’d have to pull the message context (2 messages before & after) from Cassandra to power the UI anyway. Keeping the actual message object out of Elasticsearch means that we don’t have to pay for additional disk space to store it. However, this means we can’t use Elasticsearch to highlight matches in search results. We’d have to build the tokenizers and language analyzers into our client to do the highlighting (which was really easy to do). We decided that a microservice for search was probably not required, and instead we exposed a library that wrapped our routing and querying logic to Elasticsearch. The only additional service we needed to run is the index workers (which would use this library to do the actual indexing work). The API surface area exposed to the rest of the team was also minimal, so that if it did need to be moved to it’s own service, it could easily be wrapped in an RPC layer. This library could be imported by our API workers as well to actually execute the search queries and return results to the user over HTTP. To the rest of the team, the library exposed a minimal surface area for searching messages: Queueing a message to be indexed or deleted: Bulk indexing (roughly) real time messages within a worker: For indexing a server’s historical messages, a historical index job which would perform a unit of work and return the next job that needed to run to continue indexing that server. Each job represents a cursor into a server’s message history and a fixed unit of execution (in this case defaulting to 500 messages). The job returns a new cursor to the next batch of messages to be indexed or None if there is no more work to be done. In order to return results quickly for a large server, we split the historical indexing into two phases, an “initial” and “deep” phase. The “initial” phase indexes the last 7 days of messages on the server and makes the index available to the user. After that, we index the entire history in the “deep” phase, which executes at a lower priority. This article shows what it looks like to the user. These jobs are executed in a pool of celery workers, allowing for scheduling of the jobs amongst other tasks that the workers run. This roughly looks like: After coding this up and testing it on our development environment, we decided it was time to see how it’d perform on production. We spun up a single Elasticsearch cluster with 3 nodes, provisioned the index workers, and scheduled 1,000 of the largest Discord servers to be indexed. Everything seemed to be working, however when looking at the metrics on the cluster, we noticed two things: CPU usage way higher than expected. Disk usage was growing way too fast for the volume of messages being indexed. We were pretty confused, and after letting it run for a while and use up way too much disk space, we cancelled the index jobs and called it for the night. Something wasn’t quite right. When we came back the following morning we noticed that disk usage had shrunk by A LOT. Did Elasticsearch throw away our data? We tried issuing a search query on one of the servers that we indexed that one of us was in. Nope! The results were being returned just fine — and fast too! What gives? Disk Usage Growing Fast then Tapering Off CPU Usage After doing some research, we came up with a hypothesis! By default, Elasticsearch has its index refresh interval set to 1 second. This is what provides the “near real-time” search ability in Elasticsearch. Every second (across a thousand indexes) Elasticsearch was flushing the in-memory buffer to a Lucene segment, and opening the segment to make it searchable. Over night, while idle, Elasticsearch merged the massive amounts of tiny segments it generated into much larger (but more space efficient) ones on disk. Testing this out was pretty simple: We dropped all the indexes on the cluster, set the refresh interval to an arbitrarily large number, and we then scheduled the same servers to be indexed. CPU usage was down to almost nothing while the documents were being ingested, and disk usage was not growing at an alarmingly high rate. Huzzah! Disk Usage After Decreasing the Refreshing Interval CPU Usage Unfortunately, however, turning off the refresh interval doesn’t work in practice… It had become apparent that Elasticsearch’s automatic near real-time index availability wouldn’t work for our needs. Chances are a server could go hours without needing to execute a single search query. We needed to build a way to control the refreshing from the application layer. We did this through an expiring hashmap in Redis. Given that servers on Discord are sharded into shared indexes on Elasticsearch, we can build a quick map that is updated alongside the index, tracking if an index needs to be refreshed — given the server you are searching in. The data structure was simple: the Redis key storing the hashmap was prefix + shard_key to a hashmap of guild_id to a sentinel value saying that it needed to be refreshed. In retrospect, this could have probably been a set. The indexing lifecycle thus turned into: Take N messages from the queue. Figure out where these messages should be routed to by their guild_id . Execute bulk insert operations to the relevant clusters. Update the Redis mappings, signifying that the shard and the given guild_id s within the Shard that were updated are now dirty. Expire this key after 1 hour (as Elasticsearch would have auto-refreshed by then). And the search lifecycle turned into: Look up the Shard that needs to be queried for the guild_id . Check the Redis mapping to see if the Shard AND guild_id is dirty. If dirty, do a refresh of the Shard’s Elasticsearch Index, and mark the entire Shard as clean. Execute the search query and return results. You may have noticed that even though we now explicitly control the refreshing logic on Elasticsearch, we still have it auto-refresh the underlying index every hour. If data-loss occurs on our Redis mapping it’d take at most one hour for the system to correct itself automatically. Since deploying in January, our Elasticsearch infrastructure has grown to 14 nodes across 2 clusters, using the n1-standard-8 instance type on GCP with 1TB of Provisioned SSD each. The total document volume is almost 26 billion. The rate of indexing peaked at approximately 30,000 messages per second. Elasticsearch has handled it without a sweat — remaining at 5–15% CPU throughout our roll-out of search. So far, we’ve been able to add more nodes to the clusters with ease. At some point, we will spin up more clusters so that new Discord servers being indexed land on them (thanks to our weighted shard distribution system). On our existing clusters, we’ll need to limit the number of master eligible nodes as we add more data nodes to the cluster. We’ve also stumbled upon 4 primary metrics that we use to decide when the cluster needs to be grown: heap_free: (aka heap_committed — heap_used) When we run out of free heap space, the JVM is forced to do a full stop-the-world GC to quickly reclaim space. If it fails to reclaim enough space, the node will crash and burn. Before then, the JVM will get into a state where it’s doing stop-the-world GCs constantly as the heap fills up and too little memory is freed during each full GC. We look at this along with GC stats to see how much time is spent garbage collecting. disk_free: Obviously when we run out of disk space, we’ll need to add more nodes, or more disk space to handle new documents being indexed. This is very easy on GCP as we can just grow the size of the disk without rebooting the instance. Choosing between adding a new node or resizing disks depends on how the other metrics mentioned here look. For example, if disk usage is high, but the other metrics are at acceptable levels, we’ll choose to add more disk space rather than a new node. cpu_usage: If we reach a threshold of CPU usage during peak hours. io_wait: If the IO operations on the cluster are getting too slow. Heap Free (MiB) Time Spent GC/s Heap Free (GiB) Time Spent GC/s It’s now a little over three months since we’ve launched the search feature, and so far this system has held up with little to no issues. Elasticsearch has shown stable and consistent performance from 0 to 26 billion documents across around 16,000 indices and millions of Discord servers. We’ll continue to scale by adding more clusters or more nodes to existing clusters. At some point, we may consider writing code that allows us to migrate indices between clusters as a way to shed load from a cluster or give a Discord server it’s own index if it’s an exceptionally chatty server (though our weighted sharding system does a good job of making sure large Discord servers usually get their own shards currently).

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord stores billions of messages", "author": ["Stanislav Vishnevskiy"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-stores-billions-of-messages-7fa6ec7ee4c7", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Discord continues to grow faster than we expected and so does our user-generated content. With more users comes more chat messages. In July, we announced 40 million messages a day , in December we announced 100 million , and as of this blog post we are well past 120 million. We decided early on to store all chat history forever so users can come back at any time and have their data available on any device. This is a lot of data that is ever increasing in velocity, size, and must remain available. How do we do it? Cassandra! The original version of Discord was built in just under two months in early 2015. Arguably, one of the best databases for iterating quickly is MongoDB. Everything on Discord was stored in a single MongoDB replica set and this was intentional, but we also planned everything for easy migration to a new database (we knew we were not going to use MongoDB sharding because it is complicated to use and not known for stability). This is actually part of our company culture: build quickly to prove out a product feature, but always with a path to a more robust solution. The messages were stored in a MongoDB collection with a single compound index on channel_id and created_at . Around November 2015, we reached 100 million stored messages and at this time we started to see the expected issues appearing: the data and the index could no longer fit in RAM and latencies started to become unpredictable. It was time to migrate to a database more suited to the task. Before choosing a new database, we had to understand our read/write patterns and why we were having problems with our current solution. It quickly became clear that our reads were extremely random and our read/write ratio was about 50/50. Voice chat heavy Discord servers send almost no messages. This means they send a message or two every few days. In a year, this kind of server is unlikely to reach 1,000 messages. The problem is that even though this is a small amount of messages it makes it harder to serve this data to the users. Just returning 50 messages to a user can result in many random seeks on disk causing disk cache evictions. Private text chat heavy Discord servers send a decent number of messages, easily reaching between 100 thousand to 1 million messages a year. The data they are requesting is usually very recent only. The problem is since these servers usually have under 100 members the rate at which this data is requested is low and unlikely to be in disk cache. Large public Discord servers send a lot of messages. They have thousands of members sending thousands of messages a day and easily rack up millions of messages a year. They almost always are requesting messages sent in the last hour and they are requesting them often. Because of that the data is usually in the disk cache. We knew that in the coming year we would add even more ways for users to issue random reads: the ability to view your mentions for the last 30 days then jump to that point in history, viewing plus jumping to pinned messages, and full-text search. All of this spells more random reads!! Next we defined our requirements: Linear scalability — We do not want to reconsider the solution later or manually re-shard the data. Automatic failover — We love sleeping at night and build Discord to self heal as much as possible. Low maintenance — It should just work once we set it up. We should only have to add more nodes as data grows. Proven to work — We love trying out new technology, but not too new. Predictable performance — We have alerts go off when our API’s response time 95th percentile goes above 80ms. We also do not want to have to cache messages in Redis or Memcached. Not a blob store — Writing thousands of messages per second would not work great if we had to constantly deserialize blobs and append to them. Open source — We believe in controlling our own destiny and don’t want to depend on a third party company. Cassandra was the only database that fulfilled all of our requirements. We can just add nodes to scale it and it can tolerate a loss of nodes without any impact on the application. Large companies such as Netflix and Apple have thousands of Cassandra nodes. Related data is stored contiguously on disk providing minimum seeks and easy distribution around the cluster. It’s backed by DataStax, but still open source and community driven. Having made the choice, we needed to prove that it would actually work. The best way to describe Cassandra to a newcomer is that it is a KKV store. The two Ks comprise the primary key. The first K is the partition key and is used to determine which node the data lives on and where it is found on disk. The partition contains multiple rows within it and a row within a partition is identified by the second K, which is the clustering key. The clustering key acts as both a primary key within the partition and how the rows are sorted. You can think of a partition as an ordered dictionary. These properties combined allow for very powerful data modeling. Remember that messages were indexed in MongoDB using channel_id and created_at ? channel_id became the partition key since all queries operate on a channel, but created_at didn’t make a great clustering key because two messages can have the same creation time. Luckily every ID on Discord is actually a Snowflake (chronologically sortable), so we were able to use them instead. The primary key became (channel_id, message_id) , where the message_id is a Snowflake. This meant that when loading a channel we could tell Cassandra exactly where to range scan for messages. Here is a simplified schema for our messages table (this omits about 10 columns). While Cassandra has schemas not unlike a relational database, they are cheap to alter and do not impose any temporary performance impact. We get the best of a blob store and a relational store. When we started importing existing messages into Cassandra we immediately began to see warnings in the logs telling us that partitions were found over 100MB in size. What gives?! Cassandra advertises that it can support 2GB partitions! Apparently, just because it can be done, it doesn’t mean it should. Large partitions put a lot of GC pressure on Cassandra during compaction, cluster expansion, and more. Having a large partition also means the data in it cannot be distributed around the cluster. It became clear we had to somehow bound the size of partitions because a single Discord channel can exist for years and perpetually grow in size. We decided to bucket our messages by time. We looked at the largest channels on Discord and determined if we stored about 10 days of messages within a bucket that we could comfortably stay under 100MB. Buckets had to be derivable from the message_id or a timestamp. Cassandra partition keys can be compounded, so our new primary key became ((channel_id, bucket), message_id) . To query for recent messages in the channel we generate a bucket range from current time to channel_id (it is also a Snowflake and has to be older than the first message). We then sequentially query partitions until enough messages are collected. The downside of this method is that rarely active Discords will have to query multiple buckets to collect enough messages over time. In practice this has proved to be fine because for active Discords enough messages are usually found in the first partition and they are the majority. Importing messages into Cassandra went without a hitch and we were ready to try in production. Introducing a new system into production is always scary so it’s a good idea to try to test it without impacting users. We setup our code to double read/write to MongoDB and Cassandra. Immediately after launching we started getting errors in our bug tracker telling us that author_id was null. How can it be null? It is a required field! Cassandra is an AP database which means it trades strong consistency for availability which is something we wanted. It is an anti-pattern to read-before-write (reads are more expensive) in Cassandra and therefore everything that Cassandra does is essentially an upsert even if you provide only certain columns. You can also write to any node and it will resolve conflicts automatically using “last write wins” semantics on a per column basis. So how did this bite us? In the scenario that a user edits a message at the same time as another user deletes the same message, we ended up with a row that was missing all the data except the primary key and the text since all Cassandra writes are upserts. There were two possible solutions for handling this problem: Write the whole message back when editing the message. This had the possibility of resurrecting messages that were deleted and adding more chances for conflict for concurrent writes to other columns. Figuring out that the message is corrupt and deleting it from database. We went with the second option, which we did by choosing a column that was required (in this case author_id ) and deleting the message if it was null. While solving this problem, we noticed we were being very inefficient with our writes. Since Cassandra is eventually consistent it cannot just delete data immediately. It has to replicate deletes to other nodes and do it even if other nodes are temporarily unavailable. Cassandra does this by treating deletes as a form of write called a “tombstone.” On read, it just skips over tombstones it comes across. Tombstones live for a configurable amount of time (10 days by default) and are permanently deleted during compaction when that time expires. Deleting a column and writing null to a column are the exact same thing. They both generate a tombstone. Since all writes in Cassandra are upserts, that means you are generating a tombstone even when writing null for the first time. In practice, our entire message schema contains 16 columns, but the average message only has 4 values set. We were writing 12 tombstones into Cassandra most of the time for no reason. The solution to this was simple: only write non-null values to Cassandra. Cassandra is known to have faster writes than reads and we observed exactly that. Writes were sub-millisecond and reads were under 5 milliseconds. We observed this regardless of what data was being accessed, and performance stayed consistent during a week of testing. Nothing was surprising, we got exactly what we expected. In line with fast, consistent read performance, here’s an example of a jump to a message from over a year ago in a channel with millions of messages: Everything went smoothly, so we rolled it out as our primary database and phased out MongoDB within a week . It continued to work flawlessly…for about 6 months until that one day where Cassandra became unresponsive. We noticed Cassandra was running 10 second “stop-the-world” GC constantly but we had no idea why. We started digging and found a Discord channel that was taking 20 seconds to load. The Puzzles & Dragons Subreddit public Discord server was the culprit. Since it was public we joined it to take a look. To our surprise, the channel had only 1 message in it. It was at that moment that it became obvious they deleted millions of messages using our API, leaving only 1 message in the channel. If you have been paying attention you might remember how Cassandra handles deletes using tombstones (mentioned in Eventual Consistency ). When a user loaded this channel, even though there was only 1 message, Cassandra had to effectively scan millions of message tombstones (generating garbage faster than the JVM could collect it). We solved this by doing the following: We lowered the lifespan of tombstones from 10 days down to 2 days because we run Cassandra repairs (an anti-entropy process) every night on our message cluster. We changed our query code to track empty buckets and avoid them in the future for a channel. This meant that if a user caused this query again then at worst Cassandra would be scanning only in the most recent bucket. We are currently running a 12 node cluster with a replica factor of 3 and will just continue to add new Cassandra nodes as needed. We believe this will continue to work for a long time but as Discord continues to grow there is a distant future where we are storing billions of messages per day. Netflix and Apple run clusters of hundreds of nodes so we know we can punt thinking too much about this for a while. However we like to have some ideas in our pocket for the future. Upgrade our message cluster from Cassandra 2 to Cassandra 3. Cassandra 3 has a new storage format that can reduce storage size by more than 50%. Newer versions of Cassandra are better at handling more data on a single node. We currently store nearly 1TB of compressed data on each node. We believe we can safely reduce the number of nodes in the cluster by bumping this to 2TB. Explore using Scylla , a Cassandra compatible database written in C++. During normal operations our Cassandra nodes are actually not using too much CPU, however at non peak hours when we run repairs (an anti-entropy process) they become fairly CPU bound and the duration increases with the amount of data written since the last repair. Scylla advertises significantly lower repair times. Build a system to archive unused channels to flat files on Google Cloud Storage and load them back on-demand. We want to avoid doing this one and don’t think we will have to do it. It has now been just over a year since we made the switch and, despite “the big surprise,” it has been smooth sailing. We went from over 100 million total messages to more than 120 million messages a day, with performance and stability staying consistent. Due to the success of this project we have since moved the rest of our live production data to Cassandra and that has also been a success. In a follow-up to this post we will explore how we make billions of messages searchable. We don’t have dedicated DevOps engineers yet (only 4 backend engineers), so having a system we don’t have to worry about has been great. We are hiring, so come join us if this type of stuff tickles your fancy.

See teasers of all these upcoming features here . FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, any newly uploaded Avatars and Icons will have improved image quality. LET IT BE KNOWN. Right click any text message to search Google for those same words. Be careful with this one. View your recent mentions and feel the disappointment when it was just an @everyone (you can filter those out though, after the initial sadness). Adjust pins and permissions on a per channel basis with ease and finesse. It’s like doing yoga with your fingers. Long press to pin a message. “Long Press” also sounds like a yoga pose. Access channel settings from the server menu for an optimized and efficient approach. Keep lean. Server ownership can now be transferred on mobile. FROM ONE LEADER TO THE NEXT, THY SERVER IS YOURS. Reactions now exist. You can interact with them. Baby steps. Re-order channels through channel management. Sorting powers, activate! Muted channels are done being hermits and now show in the channel list. Fixed a voice chat bug on browser where people couldn’t hear each other. Hey that’s pretty good. Fixed the legendary message duplication bug by chucking 100 master balls at it. Hopefully we’re done here. Fixed ghost notification badges on channels you can no longer read because too spooky. Fixed a bug where role colors were incorrect matched with the selected role. We need order in this chaos. Fixed not being able to delete a server with 2FA on. Security too stronk. Fixed typing indicators sometimes not appearing. Maybe they were hanging out with Android’s muted channels. Fixed invalid @ everyones causing notifications to be silly.

We grew from a little hangout to a place that 25 million people use to play games with their friends. We also found a CRT on the sidewalk so we could play Melee without lag. Big year for us. Time doesn’t stop though and neither does our desire to keep building Discord into the sun. To get there, our engineers are back in the lab cooking us up some tasty things for 2017. The marketing team staged a heist and stole this heavy and slightly wet top secret folder from their lab. We barely made it out of there with the treasure in tow. Let’s take a look inside… Note that everything you see here is subject to change. Except Search, that’s pretty much done. With search, you’ll be able to browse through history using numerous qualifiers. You can even combine these qualifiers to narrow searches down. Trying to search for a specific YouTube video your friend DumplingButter posted in #memejabs sometime in November before the 19th? We got you. Trying to develop a hobby game in Unity and need some level design inspiration? Check it: As you can see, the search results will populate the right side column. You can browse them, expand them to see context, and even jump to them in the main chat to get full context. All of this runs super smooth like triple-filtered coconut oil (which is a great aftershave by the way). Anyway, search is really, really close. Some of you may even magically have it in your app before it’s officially live while we iron out the last bits. You read that correctly. Screen share and video chat are who am I kidding you don’t care about these words you’re already staring at the pictures. Just keep looking. Each person in the group can decide to share their screen or their video camera feed. If only one person is screen sharing, that feed will default to the main view. Otherwise, whoever’s talking will take priority. You’ll also be able to select who you want to view by clicking on their feed. These behaviors should be pretty familiar to other screen sharing platforms. But of course, we’re gonna juice this up with some secret sauce of our own. You’ll have to wait and see, though ~ mystery ~ Wanna know who kicked BigBootieTootie2? Wait, what was the topic changed to? WHO GAVE BRIAN THE BAD LUCK ROLE!?!? Audit logs will show a record of all administrative action to those who have access to server settings. You can also filter by action and user to drill down to whatever it is you’re snooping for in the logs. Here are the events you’ll find: Server edits Channel creation, update, and deletion Role create, update, deletion Kicks and bans (with reasons) Nickname update “Discord you have a new haircut!” Yea our server settings are getting a revamp too. They’ll be full-screen, and super hot. I’ll save the full picture for your imagination though ;). Note that this is the least developed feature here. Very subject to change. Did you know that people like to type to each other on the internet? And they like to do it in an organized fashion? To calm these crazy folk down, we’re adding the ability to organize both your voice and text channels into collapsible categories. The “Play Testing” and “Music” categories in the image below are currently collapsed. This allows server owners to better organize their channels and it allows server members more focus on what they care about. You can also apply permissions at a channel category level, which will apply to any channels in that category. Efficient :ok-hand: Well, that’s quite the smorgasbord lined up for you guys in early 2017. We’re stoked to show these off and I hope you’re as hype as we are to actually use them in the soon™ future. Soonture . New word. Nevermind I hate it. As always, please let us know what you think about our features (not my horrible jokes please spare me) by dropping a tweet to @discordapp or dispatching an email to support@discordapp.com.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how discord handles push request bursts of over a million per minute with elixirs genstage", "author": ["Jesse Howarth"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-handles-push-request-bursts-of-over-a-million-per-minute-with-elixirs-genstage-8f899f0221b4", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Discord has seen tremendous growth. To handle this growth, our engineering team has had the pleasure of figuring out how to scale the backend services. One piece of technology we’ve seen great success with is Elixir’s GenStage. This past summer, our mobile push notification system started having a struggle. /r/Overwatch’s Discord had just passed 25,000 concurrent users, Pokémon GO Discords were popping up left and right, and burst notifications became a real issue. Burst notifications brought the entire push notification system to a slow and sometimes a halt. Push notifications would arrive late or not arrive at all. After a bit of investigation, we determined the main bottleneck was sending push notifications to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging service. We realized we could immediately improve the throughput by sending push requests to Firebase via XMPP rather than HTTP. Firebase XMPP is a bit trickier than HTTP. Firebase requires that each XMPP connection has no more than 100 pending requests at a time. If you have 100 requests in flight, you must wait for Firebase to acknowledge a request before sending another. Since only 100 requests can be pending at a time, we needed to design our new system such that XMPP connections do not get overloaded in burst situations. From an initial glance, it seemed that GenStage would be a perfect fit for our problem. So what’s GenStage? GenStage is a new Elixir behaviour for exchanging events with back-pressure between Elixir processes. [0] What does that mean, really? Basically, it gives you the tools needed to make sure no part of your system gets overloaded. In practice, a system with GenStage behaviours normally has several stages. Stages are computation steps that send and/or receive data from other stages. When a stage sends data, it acts as a producer. When it receives data, it acts as a consumer. Stages may take both producer and consumer roles at once. Besides taking both producer and consumer roles, a stage may be called “source” if it only produces items or called “sink” if it only consumes items. [1] We split the system into two GenStage stages. One source and one sink. Stage 1 — the Push Collector: The Push Collector is a producer that collects push requests. There is currently one Push Collector Erlang process per machine. Stage 2 — the Pusher: The Pusher is a consumer that demands push requests from the Push Collector and pushes the requests to Firebase. It only demands 100 requests at a time to ensure it does not go over Firebase’s pending request limit. There are many Pusher Erlang processes per machine. GenStage has two key features that aide us during bursts: back-pressure and load-shedding. In the Pusher, we use GenStage’s demand functionality to ask the Push Collector for the maximum number of requests the Pusher can handle. This ensures an upper bound on the number of push requests the Pusher has pending. When Firebase acknowledges a request, the Pusher demands more from the Push Collector. The Pusher knows the exact amount the Firebase XMPP connection can handle and never demands too much. The Push Collector never sends a request to a Pusher unless the Pusher asks for one. Since the Pushers put back-pressure on the Push Collector, we now have a potential bottleneck at the Push Collector. Super-duper huge bursts might overload the Push Collector. GenStage has another built-in feature to handle this: buffered events. In the Push Collector, we specify how many push requests to buffer. Normally the buffer is empty, but about once a month in catastrophic situations it comes in handy. If there are way too many messages moving through the system and the buffer fills up then the Push Collector will shed incoming push requests. This comes for free from GenStage by simply specifying the buffer_size option in the init function of the Push Collector. With these two features we are able to handle burst notifications. Below is example code of how we set up our stages. For simplicity, we removed a lot of failure handling for when connections go down, Firebase returns errors, etc. You can skip the code if you just want to view the results of the system. An example incident Below is a real incident the new system handled. The top graph is the number of push requests per second flowing through the system. The bottom graph is the number of push requests buffered by the Push Collector. Note: These graphs are taken from the first incident after we deployed the new system. Our pushes per second have more than doubled since then. Also, we only send pushes when users are not active on the application. Order of events: ~17:47:00 — The system is nominal. ~17:47:30 — We start receiving a burst of messages. The Push Collector has a small blip in its buffer count as the Pusher’s react. Shortly after, the buffer goes down for a little bit. ~17:48:50 — The Pushers cannot send messages to Firebase faster than they are coming in, so the buffer in the Push Collector starts filling up. ~17:50:00 — The Pusher Collector buffer starts peaking and sheds some requests. ~17:50:50 — The Pusher Collector buffer stops peaking. ~17:51:30 — The requests peak then slow down. ~17:52:30 — The system is completely back to normal. During this entire incident there was no noticeable impact to the system or users. Obviously a few notifications were dropped. If a few notifications weren’t dropped, the system may never have recovered, or the Push Collector might have fallen over. We find this to be an acceptable compromise for something like notifications. At Discord we have been very happy using Elixir/Erlang as a core technology of our backend services. We are pleased to see additions such as GenStage that build on the rock solid technologies of Erlang/OTP. We are looking for brave souls to help solve problems like these as Discord continues to grow. If you love games and these types of problems make you super excited, we’re hiring!

Beginning with a short narrative and ending with a dense reference, you’ll learn how Pocketwatch Games uses Discord to develop their community alongside their newest indie game, Tooth and Tail. We’re particularly impressed by the matchmaking and game-key solutions, as they offload developer hours to the community which gives the Pocketwatch team more time to build the great game that brings the community together! Oh, and “The Crown” is one of the best community engagement ideas we’ve seen Discord used for. Now, for Andy…. Engaging with online communities is so important for gamers like me. In many ways, they become a digital family. This is where I’ve met new friends, learned new games, and become who I am today. Previously, I was using Ventrilo, Teamspeak, IRC, or other things that would require Server IPs, ports, and other nonsense. A lot has changed since then, and boy am I glad we have what we have now. We use Discord to automate giving out game keys , help our players find matches faster , create engagement and competition between community members with games like “The Crown,” and so much more. My name is Andy Nguyen, and I’m a Producer/Designer at Pocketwatch Games , and we are working on a fast paced Real Time Strategy game called Tooth and Tail. Tooth and Tail is a Real Time Strategy game that aims to be deep and competitive without the heavy handed APM (Actions per Minute) and multi-tasking that can exhaust many players. With short rounds, fast action, and playable on controller or keyboard and mouse, our most hardcore members have upwards to 1,000 hours of playtime and it’s still in Alpha. We’re the same team behind Monaco: What’s Yours is Mine , powered by the same designers, the same artist, and the Grammy nominated composer Austin Wintory. Tooth and Tail is an online multiplayer game and one that thrives on having an active, friendly community. We knew we needed something to help us grow this community and Discord gave us the tools to grow in ways that would have never been possible before. It all began in about 2014, when we first started the Tooth and Tail open alpha. We wanted to chat directly with the community to get away from the formal nonsense of PR-style emails and canned forum replies. An active, real time dialogue is what we wanted to get to the core of what our players were thinking day to day so we could make the best game possible. The simplest option we had to make a chat room was IRC. This dinosaur of a system existed since before I was born, probably, but we chose it because it was the only chat room we knew. There was one tiny feature, however, that laid the foundations of how we built our community going forward. It started in IRC but Discord would take it to new heights. The first time I ever joined an IRC channel, I noticed there were these little plus signs next to people’s names. What was that all about? They seemed so special. I wanted one. I needed one. That plus sign had nothing to do with anything really. It was meant for a different function entirely, but communities used it to recognize special contributors. Anytime we felt like a community member made a big contribution to the community, we rewarded them with a plus. It’s like a gold star by their name. Simple. Awesome! One of the best days in Tooth and Tail’s development was completely unplanned. Two of the most important community contributors to Monaco’s development were Durgrobach and Mastastealth. These evangelists would continue to help us on Tooth and Tail, this time with something as simple as saying “Use this program instead of IRC, it’s called Discord, it’s better.” “Why?” I asked, old in my ways. “IRC works. It’s chat.” “It looks better” was their reply. You got me, valid point. So, I made an account. I gave it a shot. It looked better. A personality is hard to convey over the internet. When it’s just text, there’s only so much we can know about someone. Avatars immediately helped us fill in who was who. This was the start of getting to know our community so much better and we, as developers, even had fun with this by giving ourselves unique Monaco-themed Avatars. Avatars helped create personality amongst the community, but the single most important feature for our development of Tooth and Tail through Discord is the Roles feature. The simplest way to leverage Roles as a tool is to use it to create ranks and recognition within your community. Giving commendations to Superstars who contribute to the game means a lot to people who are passionate about your project. Simply having your name in a different color in chat makes a big difference and that appreciation goes straight back to you. But that’s Level One stuff. To understand how much we leverage Discord’s tools, you gotta check out our bots, built by our epic community. Level Two, begin. Being so early in development, there was a period of time when we didn’t have a way for people to pair up and get a game going. Without chat, your option was to open a game lobby and wait. This was not going to work. Instead, we used Discord for our matchmaking. The bot lets you use !ready and !unready to mark yourself as “Looking for Game”. The bot then changes your name to a bright ready color and moves it up the member list so everyone can see that you are “Looking for Game”. If you are looking for someone to play against, you could even type !games and the bot will list all players who are marked as “Looking for Game”. Furthermore, Discord has this sweet notification system that immediately pings people who may not be focused on chat, alt-tabbed, or in another game entirely. It really saved our butts. People could find matches quickly and easily now without us having to spend dev hours and build an internal matchmaking system off the bat. So here’s the grindy way of doing an Alpha, tested by us: have a simple form, people fill it out, and go through the list and send people keys for the game. Slow, boring, lame, like a really really bad MMO. We did it that way because it was important for us to get to know players before we add them. We only want alpha members who want to play the game, provide feedback, and contribute to the community in a positive way. When Discord came along, this process practically fixed itself. First, we routed all people interested in Tooth and Tail to Discord. Second, Discord would by default list a new member’s name in white. Then, we could then type !key (name) and the bot would PM that person a key from a database. Finally, the bot would change their Role to a member, changing their display name to green. Now we know who has a key and who doesn’t. This is great because as the key givers, we can identify who deserves a key and who already has one. So, Discord really was better looking and it worked! The community started to grow and grow but we couldn’t spend time moderating chat and seeing who deserved a key. We developed a process to allow for adding members to the alpha without any developer interaction whatsoever. The ultimate pro-team of passionate Tooth and Tail fans, our amazing moderators, have been with us for years. The system works as follows: Our moderators now monitor chat and can !vote on new members (white names). Voted members get a point, and once that prospect gets 4 votes, that person is immediately privately messaged a key by our bot. The mods understand what the developers want out of a community member. As community members themselves, they know what they want out of an Alpha member too. Participation and positive attitudes is all we ask for. This process helped perpetuate our community’s culture of positivity, and we’ve been able to add new players to the Alpha without any developer interaction whatsoever. Now, we can spend more time building the game that brings this community together! As game developers, we couldn’t help ourselves but design a game, this time inside Discord itself. We called this game “The Crown” Competition is founded in recognition and commendation which we easily achieved through the Role system. We made a game mode around this with the help of the bot. Any player can fight for the Crown. In order to take the Crown, anyone can issue a challenge once per day. The current Crown holder will be notified by our bot to arrange a match. Whoever wins the match will receive the Crown and the Role that comes with it. Again, all of this is handled by simple bot commands. This process repeats and creates a new way to play the game inside Discord. We also saw that it enabled discussion among the community with a lot of friendly competition. With the rate the community is growing, we have to constantly expand our Discord development to accommodate rapid changes. Here’s some examples of questions we ask ourselves daily. How can we improve the new member experience? Where do members go if they want to have certain questions answered? How do we accommodate for the rapidly growing size of the community? How can we consistently respond to frequently asked questions? As a developer, these are all problems you will have to face if you are growing your Discord channel. The good news is they are all solvable problems. Here’s how we address them. Here’s a collection of channel based tricks you can do in Discord to better your community. Consider making a chat room that disables chat for all members, except for the Developers. This allows you to create a channel where members can go to get all important information, free of spam, emotes, and dongers. They can still react to posts though, and show how they feel about the post. Here’s some examples of what we have: Announcements A channel for all important game development announcements. Rules A channel that establishes rules like how to participate, what is unacceptable, and FAQs. Hall of Fame a place where we can recognize previous tournament winners, complete with ranks, dates, and VODs. We created multiple channels within our Discord for the purposes of coordinating different community teams to help build upon the game. Here are some examples of our strike teams: Tooth and Tail Wiki Collaborative effort among interested community members to talk about which aspects of the wiki need to be updated and who is responsible for each section. Tech Support Most of the technical support questions are easily answered by veteran players of the community. We separated these conversations out so players knew exactly where to go. As developers, this is a huge load of work that is relieved from us. Mod Development Modding and Real Time Strategy games have a massive history, from DotA to Tower Defense. As developers, we are inspired to give players the tools to make their own creations. Modding requires a lot of discussion and teamwork, so we created a place for interested parties to discuss. Balance Players love to endlessly debate over what is OP or UP. To support these conversations and to help developers fine tune the game, we’ve separated these debates out into another channel. A small team can now have the help of the entire community to balance a complex strategy game. Tournament Coordination Using Challonge, we used to make brackets and stream tournaments of Tooth and Tail. As the community took on a life of its own, a few members started coordinating their own tournaments. This coordination is a huge task, since there can be a lot of downtime as people wait through matches. This channel is for conversation about how to get these tournaments to run as smooth as possible. These are a few ways you can utilize Roles and permissions to boost community members. We make use of assigning color to member names and their priority on the member list to highlight positive contributing members. We think of this as a dynamic community spotlight, or a featured list. Here’s how to do it: Create a new role, of any title of your choice. Rank the new role above other player roles by dragging it. Assign a unique color to this role. Under Role Settings, check “display role members separately from online members.” Assign your new role to the Superstar of your choice and voila! Once we began hosting tournaments, the results became a popular topic of discussion among the community. We used the same system as the Superstar system mentioned earlier and created a new role for the Champion. Now, when the Champion speaks, everyone knows that he or she is the best at Tooth and Tail. Bragging rights are OP. As the community grew, there was no way to we could moderate it on our own. The next logical step was to seek outside help. Luckily, there are a lot of people willing to help out the development since they love the game. We started by identifying fans of the game who were consistently present in our community. Within those fans, we identified those who shared the community’s culture and vision. There are people who are born to moderate based on their experience as gamers and their maturity as people. We found that these people are more than willing to moderate. It’s a very rewarding privilege. A moderator is in essence, no different from a regular member except they can Kick, Ban, and Mute other members. These functions are last resorts however, and in our time of running a community through Discord they have only been used a handful of times. The true power of a moderator is to be able to set the tone and culture of the chat. One massive bot was built by the help of several community members that expands the functionality of Discord to whole new levels. They named it Pocketbot, and it has many functions. Here are some examples of what Pocketbot can do: When a Developer pops into Discord, Pocketbot sends a greeting message to the general chat. This let’s everyone know that a developer has logged on. This increases our community engagement as our passionate fans have a lot they want to tell us (and we like listening)! Pocketbot scans the most recent version of the game and extracts important data. Once this is done, the bot can display Tooth and Tail unit data at any time. If people are curious about the stats of a certain unit, they can type a specific command and the information on that unit is displayed in chat. This feature encourages so much discussion about game balance. We rapidly iterate on the game thanks to community feedback. Sometimes we can fix a bug in minutes and throw it online. Sometimes we will even test out a balance change for fun. This development style requires a lot of patches, sometimes more than five a day. However, the game won’t run properly if players are on different versions. We gave Pocketbot a !verify command that will return a simple link which allows players to update their version of Tooth and Tail to the latest patch with one click. With our powers combined, we are… We started building our community off of weekly development streams. Naturally, many of our members stream themselves, due Tooth and Tail’s infinite replay-ability and spectator features. Discord promotes a stream culture by showing who’s streaming at any given time. As a result, there’s constant content for people to consume, which is important for when we aren’t streaming ourselves. We’ve created custom GIFs and emotes for our server. These emotes have taken on a life of their own, creating cultural responses to common scenarios. We even have our own Kappa style emotes based on the developers’ faces. Our channel now has personality, complete with memes of our own. It’s incredibly hilarious and very entertaining. Having inside jokes and shared memes tightens the bond between the community. As a result, people became more invested with each other and the game. It wouldn’t be a community blog post if the post itself wasn’t supported by the community. Many members even helped me write this very post itself, with a special thanks to Lacante and Gaming Mistress! Additionally, the person who first told me about Discord, Brian Franco , aka Mastastealth, has contributed all the art to this post. The community has even offered to place all their tools readily available on gitlab for anyone to look at. I also want to thank our moderators, our Superstars, and all our fans. Deadbones for having over 1,000 hours playing the game and teaching us more about Tooth and Tail than we knew ourselves. CaptnFog for managing the tournament scene known as Clash of Comrades . Durgrobach and Mastastealth for knowing all of the intricacies Discord has to offer. AVUltima, Zenoakoop, Lacante, and many more for creating helpful video tutorials and guides. There’s so many more I wish I could get to, thank you all very much.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "we care about your voice engineering special", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/we-care-about-your-voice-engineering-special-c6348d7dc068", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com O ver the last four months, a couple of our engineers tucked themselves into a cave and coded some incredible backend voice chat infrastructure improvements. These are the kind of fixes that just make Discord work better. You’ll never notice them because… well, that’s the point. Your voice experience should just be smoother than ever. We want to provide some insight into what we actually did so you can understand how much we care about making sure your voice chat experience is as painless as possible. This kind of work isn’t the sexiest stuff but it’s some of the most important work we do here. With an expert three-pronged approach, two of our engineers, Jesse and Andrei, were able to greatly reduce voice issues and improve performance across the board. This was done by creating a curator, leveling up our infrastructure, and improving our client technology. Watch the video for a basic breakdown from our engineers Jesse and Andrei. Then, read below for further details. Server health is important. If you’re connected to a server that’s experiencing issues for whatever reason, you might encounter things like robo voice or even disconnects (which is, clearly, the last thing we want our users to experience). Maintaining connection in the middle of a gank can be the defining factor between success and failure. The curator detects and removes bad servers. It does this by sending all servers some network data similar to the voice data that users send. The curator then inspects the return traffic. If it’s not healthy, it alerts the clients that the server is bad and the server is removed. Discord engineers can also manually blacklist bad servers, providers, and regions when issues arise. Another sweet feature of the curator is that it improves our ability to roll out updates without disturbing our users. Most of the time we can update our voice servers while users are on them. Sometimes though, an update requires us to take the server offline. The curator can mark a server as “draining”, allowing currently connected users to finish up their voice session on the server. However, new sessions will be started on non-draining servers. Once all the sessions on the server have finished, we take the server offline and do the update. One of the key things that Discord provides over self-hosted alternatives is something called “failover.” When issues arise with one particular provider or data center, Discord will move users connected to these servers to healthier servers. This happens seamlessly on our end — as a user, you’ll never notice this occurs (unless you’re staring mindlessly at your voice connection information for some reason). We improved this process in a few ways. First up, we added multiple providers and data centers to almost all of our regions so we can have more options. Second up, we increased the number of servers in each region. Increased capacity means more, more, and more options. Finally, we consolidated servers in some regions to provide cleaner and less confusing server options. Overall, this means our backend has a lot more flexibility to maintain connection for our users. The last bastion of these improvements is our client itself. The client is now much more resilient to spotty internet and will resume connections without losing any voice traffic. Network changes, Wi-Fi blips, IP changes, and short internet outages are now recognized quickly and our voice reconnection responds just as fast. In practice, you’ll notice far less connection issues when experiencing these things. As we said in the beginning, the key with these improvements is that you will never notice them taking effect. We do all the heavy lifting behind the scenes and we do it all seamlessly so you can do the thing you’re trying to do — play games with a stable, high quality voice connection. If you have a friend who may have had an issue connecting with Discord in the past, now would be a great time to have them give Discord another shot. May your connections be strong and your ganks successful. Wanna be a part of our next engineering endeavor? Check out our job listings here.

Here at Discord, security is a primary focus. Discord should be a place you feel comfortable. It should feel like a soft cushy bed filled with every feathery quilt you own so its like a wavy pile of air. Also your bedroom door is hella locked. Let’s review what Discord does to keep your experience safe and a new feature we’re adding to the family. Because Discord uses a client-server architecture for all voice and text communication, your IP is kept securely locked down and out of sight from any bad guys. This means you’re safe from DDOS attacks. Furthermore, all image and link previews people post are proxied through our system, which means your IP address is double safe. Woa! We’ve been visited by the security ghost! He’s come to warn us — If you leave Discord by clicking on a link that brings you to an external site, the external site will see your IP. We can’t protect you out on the wild wild web, sorry fam. Once you’ve verified your account , we will require that you confirm via email any log-in attempts from different IP’s than you actually use. It’s kinda like having a security pup alerting us when you smell different than usual. The big daddy in security features, two-factor authentication (2FA) requires you to authenticate your log-in by entering a code available on a separate phone or device. Furthermore, servers can require all their moderators to have 2FA enabled. This prevents the bad guys from getting into an admin’s account and messing around. With 2FA enabled amongst everything previously listed, your account is heavily secured. To log in, you’ll need to: Know your username Know your password Log in from a familiar address (or verify a change) Enter a code from a phone or other device. All this with a tasty creamy layer of client-server architecture protecting you from the get go. Discord loves streamers, so we previously implemented Streamer Mode , which automatically detects when you open OBS or XSplit and hides sensitive information within Discord’s UI — like your email, Discord tag, and invite links. This can also be turned on manually in your user settings. In summary, we have a whole squad to protect you. There is always room for improvement. For those of you who have used Discord for a change log or two, you’ve noticed how we strive to make Discord better all the time. We will soon level up security even further by introducing the newest member to our security feature family — File Warnings. Specifically, we will warn you when a file you’re about to download looks like an executable or zip. This sounds minor, but its a big step in helping every Discord user be a little bit safer. We also added Virus Scanning, which will automatically scan uploaded executables and archives to make sure they’re safe. While we will always try our best to make Discord safe, you must also be aware that Discord is still the internet. Clicking unfamiliar links, downloading unfamiliar files, and talking to unfamiliar people can lead to a bad time, mmk. As a final reminder, never share your password or other personal information on text or voice chat. Discord employees will never ever forever never ask you for this information. That’s it for this PSA. I’m Safety Jim, and I hope that your communication remains safe and sound. Until next time.

Bearing your heart and soul on digital display is hard enough and then there’s the task of making a living from it. How do you break through the noise? How do you build a following? How can you follow your passion? Step into this red telephone booth with me as we travel back in time for a radical history lesson… In the medieval and Renaissance period, artists were commissioned by nobility, religious organizations, and wealthy individuals to create specific works of art. This is called “patronage.” As Wikipedia describes it, “patronage is the support, encouragement, privilege, or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows to another. In the history of art, arts patronage refers to the support that kings, popes and the wealthy have provided to artists such as musicians, painters, and sculptors.” So basically, people with a lot of money wanted some sweet art slapped on their domes and they commissioned some dope artists to do the work. Not until the mid-19th century did European culture move away from this patronage system to more contemporary mass consumption that has allowed artists to make a living from lots of people buying their stuff. Fast forward many moons to May 2013 when Patreon launches. Patreon (who’s name comes from the aforementioned Patronage), aims to recreate, to an extent, the old-school style of patronage in a modern format. Fans are “patrons” and pay the creators for producing art. Furthermore, as Discord is already being used as a community tool for content creators, it made sense to hook up the two services. Brent Horowitz, the VP of Business and Corporate Development at Patreon said to me in an email, “At Patreon, we are all about helping creators build close-knit communities with their top fans. Enabling Discord roles via Patreon rewards does just that by giving gaming fans an exciting and relevant way to engage with their favorite streamers. And just as cool — this partnership with Discord gives creators more tools to make a living doing what they love.” We love Patreon’s passion and enthusiasm for connecting creators with their fans and are glad to share this new StreamKit integration. At it’s core, this integration allows content creators to offer Discord-specific perks to their patrons through rewards. Not only that — it’s super duper double dimple simple to set up. Check it: To set up the perks as a creator is straightforward. First, on Patreon, head over to the creator page settings. Click the purple button of destiny and it’ll pop up this screen (or it’ll ask you to log in first): Choose the server you’d like and select Authorize to get the integration going. Now you can add Discord roles as a perk to any of your reward tiers. Edit a reward and you’ll see this box in the settings: For this to properly work, the Patreon role in your Discord server must be above any roles it’s controlling. Check out Patreon’s support article if you’re having issues setting any of this up. As a patron, connecting Discord is simple dimple too. Head over to your account settings and sync things there. The Patreon bot will automatically assign the appropriate roles to users. We’re excited to see the relationship between creator and fans get tighter as well as communities get stronger as content creators live their dream.

Grab the mobile app so your friends can make your pocket buzz. Android Attachments can now be sent with love letters… like the desktop client. A fancy schmancy BOT tag is now shown on some of the bots available around Discord Town. We added ​ even more ​ server capacity in all regions! Can’t stop. Fixed a super obscure bug that caused channel names to flicker on hover. [Android] Keyboard bug for tablets in landscape mode not adjusting the view to fit. [Android] Read states for DMs would get wacked out. Now they should get less wacked out. The Linux build is under active development… thanks primarily to a gentleman named Chris. We’ve started designing a whole bunch of fancy highly requested features like SUB CATEGORIES ERMAHGERD. Phase 2 of the friends list is on deck. What could that BOT tag mean?

A noise echoing. A wish to begin again. What is the mystery behind airhorn bot? What is it’s secret purpose? What is behind this mask of justice? What is behind this sound of truth? These questions, and more. But before we seek to uncover the truth, we must take a journey. A journey… into the past. Last December, we published a blog post detailing the community-driven reverse engineering of our API. A bunch of awesome bots have been roaming around the Discord ecosystem providing everything from moderation tools to music bots to a shitpost bazooka. Today, we’re announcing the initial launch of Discord’s official API. This includes documentation, application support, bot users, basic OAuth, and the level of juice you expect from Discord. We’ll be rolling out the full API in the future. Check out the official Discord API documentation here. Go ahead, celebrate with a crisp glass of sugar sweet orange juice. As stated above, we’ll be launching part of the official API today. We want to get you guys rolling with our API now than wait for the entire project to be completed. Also we’re just excited we get excited pretty often I’m excited are you excited!?!?!? We plan on releasing the above API features in the following order: Outgoing webhooks and incoming webhooks. Slash commands with autocomplete. Granular OAuth. Built-In Integrations. On April 1st, we announced the revolution in communication: Airhorn Solutions . Since the launch we’ve had more than 500,000 airhorns bellowing amongst Discord servers. Why would we unleash such a creation upon the world? Chaos? Calamity? Sanctuary? What is the secret of airhorn bot? Well, dear time traveller, the airhorn bot’s secret is that it’s an open-sourced bot built with our initial release of API tools. You can check out the source code on our Github page . Please enjoy safely and use ear protection. We look forward to seeing what kinds of bots make their ways onto Discord. If you’re looking to chat and hang with other devs working on Discord bots, check out the unofficial Discord API Server . We look forward to seeing what is made with these tools… and we may even have something competitive in the future. That, my friends, is the real secret here.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "upcoming feature preview friends list", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/upcoming-feature-preview-friends-list-5096afe74ce5", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com Edit: Images of the app in here may be out of date. For the majority of the people who work at Discord, our best relationships and friendships have been the result of playing games together. What better way to bond with someone than murdering zombies together? This is one of the core philosophies driving Discord (no, not murdering zombies although we’re definitely proponents of a zombie-free world). It’s a desire to create that hype feeling of playing Super Smash Bros in the same room, yelling and laughing with friends or battling through a long enduring session of hardcore Diablo trying your best to stay alive together. Even our CEO/Founder and myself are brothers who grew up gaming side by side. Pretty sure my controller is unplugged #YoungerBrotherProblems. He’s just salty because I wreck him at Smash now. If you look at our feedback page, you’ll see that a friends list is one of our most highly requested features. Look at all these upboats: Well, we’ve heard you fam. The first part of our friends list feature will be added within the upcoming weeks and the other two pieces in due time. What’re these pieces? Check it: Let’s dig into each of these and what they entail. Have I told you how cool lists are? Because lists are so in right now. They’re so cool, that our friends list means you no longer have to share a server with someone to interact with them or to see their online status. Here’s an overview screenshot of the friends list: The friends list screen is found by clicking the Friends button at the top of your direct messages. There are four tabs in the friends list screen. Notice that “blocked” tab? Yeah, you can block those annoying people now. #blessed Moreover, you can choose who is allowed to send you direct messages: Friends only. Friends and people you share a server with. For those of you wondering, the server-based interactions that you’ve come to know and love on Discord remain the same. The friends list is neatly tucked away if you choose not to use it. So how do you actually add someone to your list of friendship? You’ll need to know their username and Discord tag. For example, it’ll look something like “MobBarley#1592.” You can find your tag by looking in the bottom left under your avatar and username. It’s also in your user profile to the right of your username as seen below. You can even send a friend request by clicking on the big ol’ green send request button in another persons profile. (Psssst, in case you didn’t know, you can access profiles by clicking someone’s username or avatar in a server and then choosing the profile option). You can also type this into the top-left part of the friends tab to send a request. The next friends list update will bring with it group chat and calls. The point of group chat is to create temporary, spontaneous, and free-form communication spaces in situations where making an entire server would seem heavy-handed. Wanna grind some dailies with that healer and tank you just met in a popular server? Start up a group chat and get questing. If you then run into a charming DPSer you want to include, they can hop right into the group with you two. Furthermore, you can now technically do one on one calls for that salty “1v1 mid bro” you just got yourself into. Here’s what an incoming group call looks like: The ultimate in “I can finally delete Skype off of my computer features,” our third friends list update will include the much sought after and asked for video chat and screen sharing. This is literally our top most requested feature at the time of writing: Here are some preliminary mocks of what this feature will look like: Our video chat design is still in early development so keep your eyes peeled for upcoming announcements on this in the future. The one thing I can tell you is that video chat will only be useable with people you have on your friends list. And yes, friends list is on mobile. Mobile will roll out alongside the desktop release of our friends list, so go download Discord on your phone (aka your mobile-reddit-viewing-device that also takes phone calls). We actually just released Discord on iPad about a week ago so if you’re a tablet star you should definitely hook yourself up. You gotta treat yourself sometimes you know? Friends list is a feature we’ve been talking about releasing for far too long so I’m sooooooooooo excited we’re finally here to drop it like Skrillex or any other overused EDM joke. Friends list will bring server-independent interactions as well as added privacy and safety settings. Group chat and calls will allow for flexible communication. Video and Screen Sharing will let you delete Skype. And remember, friends list is tucked away so if you’re a server fiend your experience remains unchanged. I look forward to more laughing, saltiness, and triumphs that come from playing with friends and family. Imagine a Place 65 4 Social Media Snapchat 65 claps 65 4 Written by Chief Robot Hamster.

Easily see what servers you share with someone. A lot more to come with this one… The Direct Message tab has a fancy search feature that is actually useful. We tossed the old one out with the trash. Muted Servers are now sorted towards the bottom of your server list because you probably don’t care about them too much. A Silence warning bar pops up if we think you’re trying to talk but don’t hear your soft, caring voice. Downloads page at discordapp.com/download has received a super epic juice pass. Can’t stop the sparkles. DDoS Hardware protection has been deployed for the Frankfurt and London regions. Major Bandwidth reductions and server speed improvements due to a shiny new binary protocol. US Central voice server region is live in Chicago. These servers get extra puffy winter jackets and beefalo hats. Steam Protocol links are now clickable in chat. US South voice server region is live in Dallas. Someone please send me some barbeque. Added a new debug panel under the connect info popout to help diagnose voice issues. Check this out if you’re having weird stuff happen. For our friends with OCD, the Windows taskbar icon will now only flash when a notification appears. @ mentions in channel topics no longer look ridiculous in the dark theme. Runaway message scrolling has calmed down on the new version of Chrome and Firefox. The ping indicator used to be kind of wonky. So we made it less wonky. We met Itaku at PAX. He was disappointed that ¯_(ツ)_/¯ didn’t work. Now it does. The channel UI no longer accidentally hides users who are in a voice channel. Sorry about that one. The iPad app has been submitted to Apple along with a new iPhone update. Ohhhh boy! We’ve redone the in-game overlay tech and it’s available today in the Discord PTB. Grab it from the download page! Friends List development is underway and we’ve already started releasing pieces incrementally. Higher configurable bit rates for voice channels… because Music Bots. Yes yes. Really.

Unfortunately, the tech behind this was a bit clunky. We had to constantly update it and add games being played that weren’t in our system. Thankfully, one of our engineers, Chris, had ENOUGH with this. With theatrical force, he concocted game detection 2.0. After the chaos, another engineer of ours, Shadi, took the mess and created a beautiful new interface out of it. Game Detection 2.0 was born. To access this, go to your User Settings by clicking the cog in the bottom left near your username. Then go to the Games tab. In here, you can choose to display your currently running game or not. Privacy options for the win. We’ll also still auto-detect a bunch of games, but if we don’t catch the one you’re playing you can add it by selecting an already running process and adjusting it’s name. We think you’ll have stupid fun with this feature like I’ve had… If you’re feeling edgy and running Windows, you can grab our Public Test Build (click where it says Public Test Build above the download button) and mess around with the latest overlay feature per-game in this menu.

Sound like a tin can (8kbps) a telephone (64kbps) or Professor X (96kbps). FYI Discord is 64kbps by default. Desktop and Chrome clients only! Everyone must be on the latest version of too. Drag ‘n Drop has been overhauled with a fancy new confirmation modal. No more accidentally dropping your… umm… homework into a Discord chat by accident. Create Server now auto selects the closest voice region to your mouth. It used to be random because we’re lazy. The iPad App is live with support for landscape, slide over, and split view. Say goodbye to your home button. Use Twitch partner emoji from your iPhone or iPad. No kappa yet though. We’re still working on that. Android Tablets now have a super legit UI. It’s like our iPad UI but powered by green robots. Android can now upload your finest photographs from your phone’s image gallery using the latest in high technology. It’s developed instantly and shared with your friends! Wow! Android Channel Settings can now be changed by users with Manage Channel permissions instead of running to your computer like a maniac. Notification Settings can be customized from your Android device. ‘Bout time. Fixed /me breaking with certain sentences (thanks /u/Always_Helpful). That really annoying microphone mute banner does not show up if we have ever detected voice in this session. Also the microphone mute banner can now be permanently disabled. Thank the heavens. The chat linkifier used to reveal your precious secrets by linkifying private text channels. Now it doesn’t. Clicking Save when editing a message now saves the message instead of obnoxiously losing your edits. Long channel names no longer cause the invite and setting icons to get flustered. Playing embedded videos no longer screws up your scroll position. Sub-pixel discoloration around server icons has been sub-scrubbed. Channel name, Invite, and Settings buttons on muted channels are no longer impossible to see on hover. The file upload in-progress indicator got a make over. If you try to upload a file that’s too large Discord will let you know it’s unhappy instead of just ignoring you. Copy and pasting into upload disabled channels no longer pretends to upload something. Chrome now defaults to 64kbps for voice channels just like the Discord Desktop app. Many app images have been compressed resulting in about ~10% file size reduction for image assets. Fixes a bug where clicking on a ridiculously large image would cause the desktop app to restart on Windows. Improves the way images are loaded when clicking on them by showing a loading indicator instead of a partially loaded image while it’s being loaded. Fixed a bug where servers would sometimes get stuck waiting around for endpoints. Message rendering has been disciplined and will be less wonky. Fix action sheet behind keyboard bug. Fix crash of an extra empty line. Fix crash of deleting server when the user is in AFK channel. Fix crash of joining server. Disable the text input bar if the channel is read-only. Drawer optimization. Added show password icon in authentication fields. Color theme is now properly sync’d across all your clients. Fixed static when speaking on certain devices. Fixed retry button on failed messages not working. Fixed bugs with relative time. Fixed text share intents (eg: YouTube links) not working. Fixed accounts incorrectly showing as unverified occasionally. Fixed a bug where empty chats showed previously selected channel messages. Fixed notifications not always being displayed. Fixed private messaged users incorrectly displayed as online. Fixed game playing status not showing up. Fixed missing broadcast sticky permission for devices that require it.

Increased capacity in Amsterdam, US-East, US-West, and London to support all the peoples doing all the talking. 20x Performance improvement to the user interface on desktop clients.

It’ll have split view and slide over support too. Great for Hearthstone. Friends List! We’ve been working on it for a while but woooweee it’s gunna be great.

{"website": "Discord", "title": "whats going down in discord town", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/whats-going-down-in-discord-town-40415149018c", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com L ast year we set out on a journey to modernize communication apps for gamers. We were frustrated with how difficult it was to get our friends into a VOIP group for a raid or a game of League and started wondering… why? We quickly realized there wasn’t a good answer. We wanted a VOIP app that was modern, easy to use, and heartfelt. A passion driven communication platform. So, we began building Discord. Early on, we shared Discord with friends in the Final Fantasy XIV community. It started spreading slowly, guild to guild. One day in May a Discord user named Chrees (hey!) posted about our app in the Final Fantasy XIV subreddit. Lots of people were curious and gave us a look: 600 that day to be exact. We were freakin’ blown away. We had a team lunch and celebrated and danced around in circles. That was an elating experience and as a team we often look back at that day as a marker from where we’ve come. Fast forward to today and over three million people have tried Discord. One million people are joining up every single month now. That’s about 34,000 people every single day (or about 1.9 Staples Centers a day). I literally do not believe this is happening, but our team happily reminds me all the time. It’s unreal. We could not have made it here without your incredible support. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken it upon themselves to spread the Discord word. We’ve seen support from streamers including the infamous Lirik and summit1g. We’ve seen support from game devs like Cloud Imperium Games. We’ve seen support from dozens of reddit communities. We don’t even have an official API yet but there are an enormous amount of bots built in so many different languages by the community. Things like dice bots, auto-moderation bots, and music channels. Mind boggling. Best of all are the tweets. I love your tweets. I love all the messages we receive directly from you sharing your experiences and ideas about how to improve Discord. As a result of how fast Discord is spreading we’ve closed an investment of almost twenty million dollars from investors with experience building great companies like Riot, Snapchat, and Twitter. This gives us enormous resources to keep doing what we’re doing (which is a requested feature by the way https://feedback.discordapp.com/forums/326712-discord-dream-land/suggestions/10327557-keep-doing-what-you-re-doing ). The speed at which we’ve been able to innovate is a testament to our awesome team. Some of us have worked together for years, but most of us are new friends. What brought us together is a passion for gaming and how it’s shaped each of our lives. It’s the magical fuzzy thing that drives everyone on this team to really give a shit. And working with a team of people who genuinely care is a recipe for making amazing stuff. We have an incredible suite of features planned to launch over the coming months, which we’ll be sharing on twitter @discordapp along with other shenanigans. If you’re at PAX South this weekend come by our lounge and say hello (also schwag!). Thank you so much for giving us a chance to make playing games a little bit better. #dontbeabroom Jason Founder & CEO Discord P.S.

Well no, but a dedicated group of ballers have reverse engineered our API to create what we’re calling the official unofficial Discord API. In other words, if you’re a developer, you can make some bots right now, today. We will still be supporting an official API in the future (which you can see details on at the bottom of this post) but if you’re fiending for some tasty Discord modding, whet your appetite right now. Here’s some bots we’ve seen already: Looking for some automated tunes in your rooms? SexualRhinoceros’s Music Bot rocks the mic. Seeking for some randomly generated integers? Kwoth’s NadekoBot chances fate. Wow. Such bot. Much server. Gravebot brings the dank. There’s more to be done than just bots. For example, this ended up on our radar recently and is so freaking cool: It’s called D-Zone. “An ambient life simulation driven by the user activity within a Discord server.” How cool is that!? Damn son, and those pixels!? Mm, tasty. To get started, check out this list of libraries you can use to develop with. I’ve included the developers name who created them.

That’s right boys and girls — YouTube Gaming streamers will be able to manage sponsor-only channels by having Discord automatically apply permissions to sponsors. You can even have multiple streamers doing this on a single server for a co-op version. Before you begin your journey, you’ll want to have permissions set up in your server (or at least understand them). If you haven’t explored the permissions feature of Discord, check out this article to get the knowledge. To get started head over to User Settings > Connections > YouTube. Once you’re connected, you have the ability to sync your YouTube Gaming sponsors with Discord in Server Settings > Integrations. If you have permissions on several YouTube accounts you will see more than one in this list. Once synced, Discord will auto create a special Sponsor Role for each streamer account (where you have the Manage Roles Permission). At this point, you can rename the role and manage permissions in the Roles tab of your Server. Now that you have a proper sponsor group with the right permissions, we will auto-detect who currently sponsors you and manage access. You can also adjust the expiration grace period depending on how benevolent you are. This, of course, makes your sponsors happy too. They just go to User Setting > Connections > YouTube to connect, then hit join on your server! No more monthly emails with new server credentials — just unabated Discord community love ❤. We hope to help you become the very best that no one ever was. To sync them is your real test — to entertain them is your cause. Good luck, streamer!

{"website": "Discord", "title": "how to get the most out of your community server", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-community-server-a049d126f2ac", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com If you’re a Twitch or YouTube Gaming partnered streamer, go sync your account in Discord before reading this. Here’s how to do it. D iscord is being used by communities of all shapes and sizes (even you, rhombus)! As we dive into this post, we will be using Twitch Streamers as the lens through which we explore community server set up. Any type of community can benefit from the ideas in here, though! So now, beloved community leader, you hopefully have a Discord server. If not, stop being a broom and get your community in there! The question is then, “how do I best set up my Discord server” and then “how can I best use Discord to interact and engage with my community?” Astute questions! In this post, we’ll explain how to set up your server with a Welcome Channel and Announcements Channel to help ease new recruits in to the Discord experience. We’ll also suggest ways to tell your audience about your shiny new Discord server. Finally, we’ll share some sexy ways we’ve seen streamers use Discord to illustrate how to engage with your community. Note: a lot of the below screens are heckin’ old! Discord’s gotten quite the makeover since. We’ll stop being lazy and update these one day :^) Before we jump into designing your servers, we recommend setting a Verification Level and adjusting your Default Notification Settings to secure things. Get going with a safe start. For a public server, we recommend at least setting your Verification Level to Low . We highly recommend setting the Default Notification Settings to Only @mentions though. Loading up Discord and slapping channels together willy-nilly is some bronze-tier stuff. To be a shining diamond, you’ll want to set up your server with some intent. Here’s a baller server designed by streamer TKBreezy and his power mod, Mudkip. Let’s run down the smart ways TK has set up his server. TKBreezy promotes his server with an instant invite link from his #welcome channel. As a result, any newcomers will land in this channel first. In here, they are shown some information that eases them into the server experience. They also include some basic Discord tips for those new to the software. Specifically, the instructions here guide newcomers to add a profile picture. They also suggest the newcomer uses Push-To-Talk as a default voice configuration. Here’s how to make a room like this: Create the welcome channel Deny @everyone the Send Messages permission. Give a mod or yourself the Send Messages permission. By denying @everyone the ability to Send Messages, you can control the room and only post content in there you want. Then, by giving a trusted mod or yourself the green check box, you now have permissions to post in here and craft the warm welcome message. Much like a welcome room, the announcements channel is a place where you can constantly update your Discord homies. Make a post when you’re gonna go live with an @everyone mention or post some updates to your server, stream schedule, or whatever you want! This channel has the same permission set-up that the welcome channel above has. Follow the above GIF to set it up. These two rooms are great if you want to add some design and structure to your initial Discord experience. Below is a grid of further channel suggestions. Be wary not to add too many channels or people will get overwhelmed and the activity between them all will lessen. That said, don’t be afraid to add new channels and see if your community adopts them! This begs the question… how do I get my viewers to join my Discord community in the first place!? Well, duh… but if you don’t let your viewers know that you have a Discord server they won’t know to join it! As I said above, you can’t just slippity slap together a Discord and hope people come. Here are some ways we’ve seen other people talk about their Discord spice: Make a YouTube video explaining how to join the community server. Post on your communities official Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, or other social media platform. Show and talk about your Discord server on stream. You can even have a chat bot post it in your Twitch Chat and a panel below your stream that links to your server with a description. For sub servers, where you describe Sub benefits, put something like “VIP access to the sexiest Discord lounge known to mankind.” Here’s an example of Discord as a panel below a Twitch stream from Biinny. He made his own custom panel but at the bottom of this post we’ve supplied some images you can use for your own Twitch page! Don’t forget to include the Instant Invite link in all of these methods! You can even set a permanent invite link that never expires. Check it out in this EXCLUSIVE DISCORD PRO TIP. Last but not least, you can hook up a Discord widget onto your community website. Here’s how TEST Squadron , one of Star Citizen’s top organizations, use the Discord widget. You can find the code needed to hook this up on your website in the Widget tab in your Server Settings. Make sure to check the Enable Widget box! Look at you. You’ve got people hanging out in your server and visitors checking it out regularly. I am just so proud of you. You’ve grown up so fast. Now, you gotta be active if you want to keep your fans engaged. Newton’s Third Law of Communities says “Your community gives back what you give to it.” You gotta give love to get love. What are some ways that you can engage your community and give them a reason to hang around your Discord? How can you get people to stop wandering in and out and root down? Here’s some strategies that we’ve seen work pretty well for some Discord badasses. As you’re wrapping up your live stream, let your viewers know that you’ll be spending some time hanging out in your Discord server afterwards. In fact, making this a regular occurrence gives people even more reason to stick around. Play bingo, tell jokes, or just individually say each person’s username and call them your favorite sub. Notice them all, sempai. Speedrunner and Mario Maker Extraordinaire, Trihex , has a Discord text channel called #asktri. Most of the time, this channel is locked and people are not allowed to send messages (similar to how we have the welcome channel set up earlier in this article). At times, he’ll open up the channel for people to ask him questions for a short period of time. He then hangs out and answers questions before locking it again, creating an ever-evolving and archived AMA for his fans and followers. If you’re an artist/streamer, consider having a channel inside your server dedicated to feedback on your viewers’ art. They can request feedback from other members and yourself. This is a dope way to keep people stuck and engaged. Chibi-conjuror, Rin the Yordle , has a Discord server focused around her art stream. In the #critiquecorner channel, people post their works-in-progress and get live feedback from other members and Rin herself. Beyond art, your gaming community can have a “game reviews” channel where users post reviews of games they’ve played? The meta point here is to share and discuss content with each other. For streamers, if the game you play allows for multiplayer, you should absolutely consider playing with your community. Shiny-headed Destiny streamer Professor Broman and his royal compadre King Gothalion run viewer raids with their community using Discord. Discord makes getting all the selected viewers into voice chat rooms super slick with instant invite links. Furthermore, you could even have people in a “Queue” or “Waiting Room” voice channel to let you know who’s ready-to-go for some live gameplay. Less downtime, more headshots (or kill-stealing). You can see an example of a waiting room channel in Broman’s server below, titled “Interested In Raid?” Furthermore, Discord keeps your IP secure so it’s safe to use and play with other people. No fear of DDOS! Making a Discord server and just expecting your community to be active and lively is a fools game. While some of your die-hard fans will hang out in there and some extremely community focused members will remain, you have to interact in there. Hop in and out. Post messages frequently. This community orbits you. Consider yourself a host here. Your server is your auditorium. Everyone else is a visitor, a regular, a stage-hand helping set things up. You are the center piece, the actor on stage who everyone looks at when they speak. You are the reason they are there. So, be there! By being active and fostering a Discord server, you tighten the bonds of your community. If you do it right, your community will be more engaged than ever. We hope that Discord provides an awesome platform for you to level up your community interactions and have more old fashioned good times and vibes. If you’re interested in seeing how to make an even more advanced server structure, check out this article. Below are Discord assets. Feel free to rip them and use them!

Look we were excited. Even Lirik and Summit1g gave us props! Fanboy heaven . Then a few weeks later Twitch broke Discord. The hamsters fell off the server wheel. Poor little fur balls… Want to hear more? Watch the video: Eventually we fixed it and the hamsters are now better. Faster. Stronger. Anyways…I’m sure you’re wondering what all this Twitch integration coolness is about. I’m here to provide accurate details. For those with hamster-like attention spans here’s the TL;DR: Twitch streamers can now manage sub-only channels by having Discord automatically apply permissions to their subs. You can even have multiple streamers doing this on a single server! How? Our newly minted Robo Hamster Army!! (couldn’t stay away from those cute little furballs too long and now they have robot parts too, yeah ROBOT parts). Before you get into this new feature, you have to set up your permissions. Now, this isn’t a new feature but it’s a little advanced so if it’s new to you read this help article from our very own Community and Support Guru Discord Dan. Definitely get familiar with this set up first, plus we just released colors so now you can express yourself artistically too! Step one is super easy: User Settings > Connections > Twitch. Robo. Hamster. Power! Once you’re connected, you have the ability to Sync your Twitch Subs with Discord in Server Settings > Twitch Integration. If you have permissions on several Twitch accounts you will see more than one in this list. Once synced, Discord will auto create a special Twitch Subscriber Role for each streamer account (where you have the Manage Roles Permission). At this point, you can rename the role and manage permissions in the Roles tab of your Server. Now that you have a proper sub group with the right permissions, we will auto-detect who is currently subscribed and manage access. You can also adjust the expiration grace period (because not everyone re-subs literally on the month. Show some mercy). Or you could force them to watch Footloose if they are slow. Because…80s!! This, of course, makes your Subs happy too. They just go to User Setting > Connections > Twitch to connect, then hit join on your server! No more monthly emails with new server credentials — just unabated Discord community love ❤. We now have the ability to add new integrations, so Twitch is the first of many…stay tuned! The Robo Hamsters are hard at work. Crank! Crank! Imagine a Place 187 9 Twitch New Features 187 claps 187 9 Written by Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses.

They were early fans and after some time we decided to work with them and collaborate where it made sense. A few others have done it as well so we’re excited to see Technic join the crew. Discord would not be where it is today without the support of amazing game communities like Technic , so we appreciate their support and we hope you check them out and use them if you’re into top tier Minecraft mods. So what does it mean for you as a Mod pro? You should visit the Technic blog for all the details. Our personal favorite excerpt comes from the end: “These days, it’s hard to take endorsements seriously- it seems like every time one group is talking up another on the internet, some money exchanged hands or there’s some kind of business deal in the works. For that reason, I want to draw attention to something: we’re not in any sort of partnership with Discord. No money has changed hands, we’re not getting anything in return for adding this integration or talking them up. We just really, really, really like Discord. We think it’s going to make Minecraft more fun to play. And as a result, we think that if we add integration, you’ll like Technic better and play us more. That’s all there is to it. We hope you enjoy playing with Discord and we hope that we can add a lot more integration over the weeks and months to come, so that you can get the most out of your Discord Server!” Awwww shucks!

This was built for people who can’t get enough Discord in their lives and need access to it while on those inevitable 12-hour raid sprees. Now people have been asking: What does it look li k e? How will it work? Why is Rocket League so amazing? Who is Mr. Robot? We will attempt to answer all of these questions for you through the following post. Here’s the basic view of overlay. You’ll see a list of the people in the v o ice channel you are currently connected to that hovers over your gameplay. You can click on Discord dude and move this around the screen so it shows up in a n area that doesn’t disrupt your gameplay. More on settings stuff below. You do h a ve the option to turn this off but should you chose the dark side of the force this amazingness will show up while playing ga m es. Clicking on the Discord logo w i ll bring up an expanded Discord view so you can hop around without leaving your game. During those slow moments when you’re waiting for a match to start or need to respond to that pesky troll of a friend, you can quickly jump into Discord and yell at them Molly Ringwald style: Starting a new voice c hat, switching voice servers, and looking at the pretty windows are all options from this view. We’ve heard from several Discord users that alt+tabbing to sort out a loud friend sucks. Alas! All these v o ice settings are accessible here. For you MOBA (and Rocket League) fans breaking up into teams or grouping competitors into channels quickly is a breeze from this view. D on’t waste time getting organized for a match again! When building the Discord Overlay we realized we wanted to adjust the way it appeared depending on which game we were playing. So Andy “the super e ngineer” added a few options that allow you to adjust appearance on the fly. From this view you can choose Small or Large icons. I like Large most of the time except when I’m playing RTSs. You can also change the level of detail you see for each of your friends and tweak that based on voice activity. In summary, Rocket League is amazing because rockets+cars+soccer = DUH. Mr. Robot is not a person or a figment of someones imagination, he’s the dog and the dog can code like a pro. And finally, the overlay will make using Discord while playing games even tastier. Imagine a Place 104 Gaming Mr Robot 104 claps 104 Written by Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses.

So, I’m writing this post to help you maximize your LAN (party) setup and make sure you enjoy Discord even more. Wait…more?? Can it be? Yes, it is possible. We spoke to our LAN pro users and they all had one consistent tip: Set up in advance! For example you can smack talk early and brag after the event. Brilliant! Basically the more setup you do beforehand, the easier it is for everyone involved. So set-up that server, choose your channels, and get the word out asap. Since Discord is in the cloud/sky/atmosphere you can have everyone register and join well in advance. That way they’ll all know their way around before the gaming even starts. This is going to be especially helpful for BYOC events because Discord will be installed and running on everyone’s system before the event kicks off. And, the more time spent gaming, the better. You’ll also want to set up permissions/roles in advance. The larger the LAN the more unruly it can get. And who wants NSFW pics and text spam showing up in chat the whole time? Having a few mods in the server is probably a good idea as well. Our video on permissions can be found here and text version here . Discord is all about the player and making sure you have the BEST experience possible. So let’s talk best practices for voice setup. We recommend the use of push-to-talk for LAN tournaments (just head into your “User Setting”, then “Voice”, and choose Push To Talk as your input mode). It keeps latency low and ensures that everyone has the best talk experience regardless of event size. Using Discord locally is exactly like using it with your friends across the globe. So, at it’s core, it should feel just like home (except you won’t have your teddy bear to snuggle after getting your butt handed to you in League). For more information about push-to-talk settings, check out an article in our Help Center here . That was a whole lot of info so let me make it simple. I am happy to present The Big Discord Six ! Six tips and tricks (in one easy to download and print image) for getting the best out of Discord at your super LAN tournament Here’s the really good looking PDF version! So there you have it. All you need to get Lan-tastic! But you aren’t off the hook yet friends. Now that you are using Discord for your LAN tournament, we we want to hear about it! Send event pics and love by tweeting to @discordapp. Need help for an upcoming LAN tournament or possibly even swag?

{"website": "Discord", "title": "new feature colors mod tools magic", "author": ["Nelly"], "link": "https://blog.discord.com/new-feature-colors-mod-tools-magic-7c457d89208", "abstract": "Discord HQ App Updates Engineering & Design Community Policy & Safety Resources Discord.com For a while now we’ve consistently heard from the community you need more moderation features in Discord. A little history lesson here: we launched our Alpha in Mid-May and we had no idea large game communities would support Discord the way they have. It made us happy. It made us cry. It made us a little scared. Thanks to Stan, our expert server magician, the scared part went away quickly. So what to build? Colors. All the colors of the rainbow (almost) so you can easily identify who has what role in your server. If you don’t know much about roles and permissions read more here . Once you’ve set everything up, you can start picking colors. “That’s it!?” This is serious shizz people. Is an admin pink or red? Perhaps green? Or my favorite: Discord Blurple. Ok, ok, let’s get serious…there’s actually a lot more going on here… We (mostly Jason the CEO/Codemaster) built this so it’s easy to determine Roles visually. So yeah, Roles can have an optionally assigned color. When a color is assigned to a Role/User, their username will change (to that color) in chat and on the channel’s member list. If a user is SOOO important that they have multiple roles, we’ll choose the color from the highest priority one. This is great for showing off admins, mods, or server owners in a really obvious way directly in the chat window. So set up looks like this: And Presto Magico!: Even more awesome sauce is the option to separate out users by Roles on the channel member list sorted in the order you specify. No more asking ‘who are the mods!?” — now it’s just plain obvious. And of course, since you’ll inevitably be tweaking this setup, Roles can be drag ‘n drop re-ordered to determine which has priority at the top of your member list. Can you tell I’m a fan of the 80s? If not, read my other posts. Do you know which famous movie star came from TNKOTB? Yes? Gold Star. So our original kick/ban set-up just wasn’t cutting it and we poured over a lot of feedback to land on the new kick/ban permission heuristic initiative (Dev speak). So here’s the TL;DR version: If you can kick, you can’t be kicked and if you can ban you can’t be banned. Users with the Manage Roles permissions can kick or ban users with kick/ban but they can’t kick/ban each other. The Server Owner has super powers and can kick/ban everyone. It’s also a whole lot easer to kick/ban your trolling members than it was before. You no longer have to search that long list of members for the right name. You can just click on their avatar or username to see their user pop-out info. And the user pop-out info window will stay open even if they keep spamming! (that one is for you, fire). For you mobile users out there, don’t worry we haven’t forgotten about you. Remember, our first product was a tablet MOBA so we still love mobile…its just a pain to develop on. You’ll see much of this show up on iOS at release and slowly moving to parity for both iOS and Android over time. Imagine a Place 480 5 Gaming Twitch 480 claps 480 5 Written by Chief Robot Hamster.

We just released voice chat functionality on Discord’s iOS and Android apps! You’re gonna want to update your app or visit the App Store/Google Play Store to download it right now . Unlike some other mobile apps out there -cough- -cough- -TeamSpeak- Discord is completely free. Sorry, must have had something irritating my throat there. Voice chat on mobile is perfect for those of you in an FFXIV Free Company with both PC and PS4 players. You can now voice chat across platforms and no one will feel left out. We think it’s gonna be great for hanging out with people while playing mobile games like Clash of Clans too. Try it out and let us know what you think. Tapping a voice channel will bring up a prompt asking if you want to connect. After confirming, you can see at the bottom of the screen the channel you are connected to as well as disconnect or access your voice settings. You can even use Push-to-Talk! In the voice settings you can set whether you want to use PTT or Voice Activity Detection. With PTT enabled your mic will only transmit while your finger is pressed on the PTT button at the bottom of the screen. From the voice settings menu you can choose whether to use PTT or VAD, adjust your VAD sensitivity, raise or lower your output volume, and even optimize your audio quality with the voice processing toggles.

Since we are constantly alt-tabbing out of the game to search for things on XIVDB and Gamer Escape and then sharing links with our Free Company, we thought to ourselves: “What if you could search the database or wiki directly from Discord?” “Hey, that’s a good idea!” So, we called our friends at ZAM and GE and made it happen. Ta-da (well, it took a little more than waving a magic wand to integrate it, but you get the idea)! You can now search and post information from XIVDB and Gamer Escape from a Discord text channel! It’s so simple. All you have to do is type “/” at the start of a Discord text message. This brings up a menu of different slash commands available (including /TTS). Select either XIVDB or Gamer Escape and type the item, monster, or whatever you’d like to search for. Discord will give you potential matches to your search. Selecting one of these and hitting ‘enter’ will post summary information, an image (if available) and a link in your text chat. It’s great for bragging about that amazing item you just got while raiding, sharing crafting recipes, or even posting links to guides to get your Free Company prepared for Alexander. Let us know if there are features you’d like to see added to Discord that will make playing FFXIV with Discord even better.

It was truly awesome getting the chance to interact with you all and answer some of your questions. If you weren’t able to make it, or just want to relive the magic, below is a transcript (albeit not word for word). Q (uppfinarn): Can you tell us a little about your roadmap? A (Jason): What we’ve been working on is getting discord to a place where it is good enough to use and play games with friends. And it’s cool to see you guys using it. Our next phase is to finish the feature set for mobile. We’re working really hard on mobile to get full voice chat and functionality including attachments and account creation. After that, we’re working towards getting the word out. Heavensward comes out soon and we’re starting to reach out to the whole Final Fantasy community to get more people in and kinda get Discord to the next level. Stan, do you want to mention some bonus features? A (Stanislav): All these things are up in the air. You could call them extra credit features. We want to integrate with Final Fantasy once we get bugs cleaned up. We want to link your Lodestone profile so Discord will show who you are in game. We want to have Discord server owners to sync with FC rosters so permissions are automatically set up. We also want to add slash commands to search items on XIVDB and post them into Discord chat. Finally, other things like having the “game you’re playing” provide more information like the character you’re playing, your level, your zone, your activity, etc. Jason, do you want to talk about overlays? A (Jason): Sure. So, one of the cool things we’re working on is overlays. We want to add a Discord UI that overlays your game so you can see who is talking in your voice channel and displays direct messages sent to you so you can respond without ever leaving the game. The vision is to have chat heads similar to how Facebook’s mobile chat heads function. Imagine circular avatars that pop in on the side. You’ll see the written message and you can click on them to respond. The chat head will then dismiss. Heads can pop in and light up when they start chatting over voice. You’ll have a couple of little avatar icons. We have a big focus on performance so this will not take away any experience from playing your game. Q (Mizrahi): Will there be any expansion on the text-to-speech area? Maybe a way to assign certain text-to-speech voices to certain members of your server so that you don’t need to hear the “Member says: blablabla” bit. Also, are there any plans for a “mini” mode that just shows who’s currently speaking (a bit like what Skype has)? A (Stanislav): The caveat to this feature is that it was added a week ago and we added it quickly in response to a user who requested it, so it’s not in a form where much design went into it. We obviously can’t take it away so we’re gonna work on thinking it through and making it better. You’ll be able to choose which channel you want TTS on. We also plan on supporting different voice packs. A (Jason): Do you think the usage of TTS as a feature is a side effect of not having a great overlay? Would you agree with that Stan? If you know who is showing up or who’s talking then TTS is less important. A (Stanislav): Depends on people’s usage. If a person is unable to talk, maybe, but in other voice apps, people like to keybind certain phrases. There’s ways to expand it but it’s not at the top of our list. There’s other more important things but it’s on our radar. Q (Ihm): What’s the plans as far as covering server costs and such go? You’ve said it’s free so how do you plan on covering costs and making money back? A (Jason): So I’ll talk about how we plan to make money. Stan can talk about how much servers cost and scaling it. Our plan is to keep the functionality — the core usability — free. So everything you’re using right now will stay free. Voice, text, mobile, all stay free. Almost all the new features will be free. Deep integrations and overlays and slash commands and bots — all free. Our plan is to sell optional cosmetic things. One example is what Stan just mentioned: TTS features like selling voice packs. Something like the Unreal Tournament announcer packs. Selling themes, sticker packs, fancy elaborate emoji, sound packs, different sound effects, etc, are still up in the air but it’s what we’re planning to do. As a note, part of the reason we’re not looking to make money right now is that we have raised funding from VCs in Silicon Valley. This is the second company I’ve started and the last one raised funding and did very well. We’re not stressed looking for money — we’re focused on building an amazing product and bringing real value to you guys. If we successfully deliver that we will figure out money next. A (Stanislav): The first key thing to point out is that on Vent, Teamspeak, and Mumble, everyone has their own server. Discord works differently in that it’s very dynamic. If no one on your server is online then the server doesn’t exist. We use far less physical servers to solve the same problem. This cuts the cost down a lot. The tech Discord is built on currently uses far less bandwidth than what current voip solutions use. Bandwidth costs have gone down so much so that cost is currently not on our radar. Based on current estimations it’s not gonna be much. Q (gazihsah): How will you implement a “freemium model” across multiple platforms? A (Jason): On desktop apps, payment will be with credit cards and, on mobile, we’ll have in-app purchases. It’ll be just like you typically see on these platforms. Q (Talren): Do you plan to have voice notification such as in TeamSpeak? Mumble does not have this and I believe they are at huge loss (I.E. Have a notification when someone enters the channel — not only blips and sounds). A (Stanislav): It’s been requested multiple times. On our end, it’s a UI (user interface) concern. We just need to augment the notifications tab so you can choose sound or TTS. I don’t know when it will come but it will happen. You’ll be able to choose TTS, sound, or both. Q (Nem): Is there any plans for releasing a server app so people can host their own servers? A (Jason): This is directly related to Stan’s comment that our servers are provisioned and how there is no real server if no one is there because we dynamically allocate resources. It’s all centralized. If you have multiple servers, you own the same accounts across all of them so it’s not designed in a way to run on your own server. The only reason you’d host it yourself is if the service would go down but we’re running on a distributed cloud data center so if we have trouble we can automatically move you over to another data center. Furthermore, those centers have experience dealing with DDOS and such so the level of stability is higher than what you’d expect from a normal voice server hosting product. We’re hoping there’s no reason for you to host it yourself. A (Stanislav): If you switch regions while someone is talking to you, you’ll see how quickly it can switch servers. If a hurricane takes down the east coast it’ll move you to the west coast just to keep your voice running. This is not easily done on your own. A (Jason): We chose to build our voice backend on top of Erlang which was built by the telecom industry because they needed distributed systems that must work in case of an emergency. Erlang is popular in recent years to deal with large scale distributed systems that don’t go down. It’s the technology we chose to use and we hope it works out! Q (Talren): Will it be possible to have a more contrasted UI? I have difficulties reading grey on white as well as difficulties finding the different buttons? A (Haborym): We’re gonna look at different contrast for the UI. There’s been talk about a darker theme and fixing up the left hand column so the contrast is better. For text, we’ll have different fonts for the smaller stuff. There will be lots of small improvements that will overall have a big impact. Q (LucifaZ): There seems to be a keen focus on FFXIV right now, why FFXIV specifically? Do you intend to expand this kind of integration to other MMOs or games? A (Jason): We decided we wanted to start with a single game as opposed to a lot of games because we think deep integrations to show exactly what you’re doing, what zone or fate you’re doing, make the experience much better. We thought it made more sense to try and make Discord as amazing as possible for a particular group of people and expand from there. It just so happens that a lot of us love FF (Stanislav, Mike, and Andy are rabid FFXIV players), so thats why we started that. Q (Xiao Sishen): I know WP8.1 development right now is pretty pointless, but are there plans for a native W10/WP10/XB1 app after the W10 release? (Also, I noticed I can’t use voice on the web app with Project Spartan/MS Edge. Is there a feature lacking in the preview to support it or does Discord just not recognize it as a valid browser yet)? A (Stanislav): We’re probably never gonna directly develop for the Windows Phone. There are some scenarios where we can easily bring our tech and code to the Windows platforms and, in those cases, we may do it. With Project Spartan/MS Edge, Microsoft has taken a different approach to the web voice tech thing but i’ve done the research and once they support the voice stuff we’re doing we will integrate with it and it should work. We’re waiting for them to release their final release of edge. Q (Talren): What is the link between Guildwork and Discord? Do we need Guildwork plugin to have full option available in DIscord? A (Stanislav): The link is my existence haha. I work on Guildwork and Discord. So, some things we want to do for the Heavensward launch is to create Discord servers that are tied to each FF server. If you’re a GW user you’ll have a /discord command that’ll take you to the Discord voice server for that server. There’s already a Discord widget for guild hosting. We want to get it on other guild hosting sites soon as well. We want to make it so people can easily communicate which is a value that Discord and Guildwork have in common. Q (Talren): What’s the average age of the team ? You seem pretty young! A (Consensus): Probably 29. A (Jason): Most of us have been programming since we were little ducklings. I have 18 years of experience. Stan, Andy, Chris, Fanghao, and Miguel all have similar experiences. We’re young and hungry and been around the block a few times so hopefully that shows in the product. Q (gazihsah): Which feature are you all most excited to potentially implement in the future? A (Jason): I guess overlays is something that i’m really excited about. We don’t have a picture yet — we just have this concept we’ve been discussing. Right now we are working on the core technology of getting stuff rendered over games. A (Stanislav): Piggybacking on overlays and the tech powering it. I’m excited for when you can track what you’re doing in the game and act based on it within Discord. For example, when you jump into a duty finder instance we can detect the instance ID and look to see if other people are using Discord. Then, you can opt-in to a temp voice session with those people and chat. I think that would be pretty cool. We will not make you do this if you don’t want to. It will be opt-in. “We found two users. Click to join.” A (mrkcsc): I’m excited to be connected to two voice servers at once. Normally for this I would have to connect to multiple vent servers and that’s a hassle. A (Socrates): Definitely voice chat on mobile. A (Haborym): Piggyback off Will. Voice chat on mobile. A (Zencha): I’m excited for this feature we’ve been discussing. It’ll let you press a button and retroactively record your gameplay and then post it directly into Discord chat. As a MOBA player, I can see this being really cool. For example, I can make a killer play and then press a button to instantly post it to Discord so I can show off to my friends. For MMOs, this would be great to show off a boss kill or some silly unplanned event. Q (Talren): Is there any risk for Discord to be detected as cheat by ingame protection like Steam Shield for example? A (Stanislav): What we’re doing is not something that could be detected by that. It’s possible the overlay system could but it would be equally detected if curse or steam put an overlay on you. We’re not doing anything yet that would be considered a cheat and we would like to avoid doing so. A (Jason): We will let mods and developers hook into discord and post things or read data from it. We are very specifically focusing on communication and playing games with your friends. We are looking to letting others add features to it. I don’t think we’ll ever do anything very specific that would cause that. Q (achira): What kind of strain does that put on your data plan? A (Stanislav): The strain on your data plan is the same is if you used Mumble or TeamSpeak on mobile. In fact, it’s probably a bit less. We don’t expect people to be using it much on 4G, though. The use case we expect is mostly for PS4 players or people chilling on the couch using WIFI. Q (Ihm): What’s the plans for other game detection? I believe you mentioned hooking into the steam API to show games. Will we be able to add games manually should we want to display other games? A (Stanislav): We want to make all this automatic so you don’t have to do anything manually. A nice solution would be to hook into steam and piggyback on what they are looking at. That’s not out of the realm of possibility. But, we are currently updating the list of recognized games ourselves. The games currently recognized by Discord are any Blizzard games, any Square games, League of Legends, Battlefield 4, Smite, Minecraft, Left 4 Dead, Day Z, Guild Wars 2, World of Tanks, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Dota 2. Q (Xiao Sishen): Small curiosity… how does it determine which game you’re playing if you have more than one valid game launched? I play Hearthstone a lot while I’m on WoW/FFXIV. Any plans for custom status message? A (Stanislav): Currently it shows the first game launched. A (Jason): It’s a cool feature request and we didn’t have a specific plan to add it but we will put it to our list of things to do. A (Stanislav): We like to order what we’re doing based on the amount of people asking for something. A (Jason): Yea, we’ve been talking about setting up some publicly facing list of features so that you guys can submit features, vote on them, and as the dev team we can see what kind of features everyone likes or not. We were thinking of doing something like this on UserVoice. This is what we do internally — whenever anyone mentions something we add a tally mark. If we get enough tally marks the feature gets bumped up. If the tally marks come in really fast we do it even sooner. We’re very much building this product for you guys so the input you give us is very important. Q (Talren): Is this server permanent? I see there is a bug report channel so is it possible to come post there whenever we find a bug? A (Stanislav): Yes, this dev server is permanent. It’s actually a testbed and it seems to be working haha. Q (LucifaZ): Any plans for little chat tools or apps that are integrated into the text chat? Like a handwriting pad or a dice roller or even interactive games like the old days of MSN messenger? A (Jason): Get some Minesweeper up in here! A (Stanislav): One thing we thought would be cool is to have a strategy whiteboard so while you’re in a raid, everyone with the overlay would get the white board and you could tell people where to position and where to focus. Q (Xiao Shishen): Speaking of which, is video/screen sharing on the roadmap? I’m hoping this can eventually replace Skype entirely for me. A (Jason): Video screen sharing is not currently on our near term roadmap. We’ve been talking about lots of stuff that’s core to playing games and using voice with your friends. That’s what we’re focusing on first. The tech we’ve built here could easily support screen sharing but as Achira said, gamers first and the world next. Q (Talren): Is there any function like puu.sh to automatically share screenshots with the guildmates? A (Stanislav): You can print screen on Windows or copy to clipboard on Mac and paste directly to Discord. Overlays will allow you to take a screenshot and post to channel if you want. Q (uppfinnarn): What can you tell us about external integrations? Like bots or status widgets on websites. A (Stanislav): Bots and slash commands are similar features. An advanced feature is binding a slash command to query a URL. An example is a command like /xivdb itemname which would query XIVDB and post the item back into the channel. Bots might do things without requests like post anytime Yoshi tweets about FFXIV. Another example is a Guildwork bot that posts in text chat when a hunt has spawned or even have people’s phone buzz when this happens. Q (Mizrahi): Will there be a way to have both continuous mic and Push-to-Talk options at once? On Skype, I tend to have continuous mic but press my push-to-talk button to disable my mic temporarily to talk to someone in the room etc. A (Socrates): Ha, Jason someone is asking about push-not-to-talk. A (Jason): We’ve only had one person request this feature so it had one tally but now has two! We’ve been calling it push not to talk or push to mute and it would work with voice activity too. Q (Socrates): I know we’re not giving out a specific timeline for features we are working on, but what is imminent? A (Jason): To start, we’re working on voice for mobile apps and making the apps much more user friendly for people. Currently, when you first start using Discord there are a lot of hidden features that you only discover by playing around with the app. We want to make it easier to find things. We will be adding WoW-esque quest indicators to help explain features. For example, you will see a quest icon bounce up next to the attachment button that when clicked will explain this is the button to push to attach files. Or you can just paste or drag stuff directly into the chat window. A (Socrates): In this image you can see part of the upcoming new user flow. Basically, these quests will highlight different features of the app to get you familiarized with how Discord works. You can, of course, choose to just dismiss these. But, we are also thinking of them in a way to gamify Discord a bit through profiles where you will be able to “level-up” your account. Q (Jason): We should show them the new marketing page. Check it out here! A (Socrates): This is just v1 of the landing page. We will go through it and, as we say around the office, “add the juice.” One thing you may be interested in is we are going to add “See More” buttons on each of the major benefits which will link to another page with details for that specific feature. For example, the security “See More” page will give an in-depth explanation of the security measures we have in place to protect you from DDoS as well as keep all your content private. Q (uppfinnarn): No Mumble comparison? A (Stanislav): Mumble, Vent and TeamSpeak are all very similar and would score almost exactly the same on the comparison chart. So, we decided to show only one of those three. We chose TeamSpeak because it has the most updates/momentum recently (the last update happened more than 6 months ago and it is still the most updated of the three though). Q (Ihm): In a similar way to the now playing, could you integrate twitch streaming there, displaying stream information instead or as well as? A (Jason): Yeah, I think it would be cool to have a little twitch icon next to your name if you are streaming. We are planning on making Discord really integrated with Twitch. We want you to be able to link up your twitch account to Discord. From a streamer perspective, we want you to be able to build and interact with your community on Discord. You can use bots to post in channels when you are streaming or send push notifications to your fans if they opt-in to receive this information. As a fan, it would be cool to get notifications when your favorite streamers come online. There’s all sorts of stuff we could do. Q (Telren): Would it be possible to have a remote control function with mobile app to control the main app launched on the computer? A bit like the Spotify mobile app allows you to control Spotify running on your computer. (Well I do not know if it would be useful…) A (Jason): The mobile app will eventually have all the same features as the desktop app. You’ll be able to change voice channels, change text channels, change servers, etc. Basically, anything you can do on the desktop app you’ll be able to do on mobile. A (Stanislav): Think of them as a multi-room DVR. You can pull out your phone if you leave the room and continue talking. Comments in text chat about using Discord from the bathroom. A (Jason): Not sure if we want to make it easy to go to the bathroom while talking. A (Zencha): Thats a killer feature for me. Q (Socrates): It’s cross platform synced, so if I walked away from my desktop and started typing on my phone it would it be in the desktop app when I return? A (Stanislav): Not yet, but soon! A (Jason): The read state is currently synchronized. Goal is to have it be 100% synchronized. Q (Lucifzac): When looking at my task manager I notice Discord has 5 processes up, and from what I see it’s using a fair bit of RAM. Can you explain what these processes are doing? A (Stanislav): Discord should use less CPU than TeamSpeak, mumble and Ventrilo. It does use more RAM because of the rich text chat. But, Discord will release RAM when the system is under pressure. One of them is dedicated to notification pop-ups (windows 10 won’t have this). Q (Xiao Shishen): When should we expect to see that integration in W10? After RTM? A (Stanislav): Depending on how long it takes to integrate notification API, it could be on release. A (Jason): We definitely prioritize platforms based on how many people are using it. If you got a lot of people to use the tech preview, we’d support it now. Q (Ihm): How many people roughly are using Discord so far? A (Jason): We’re still really new. About 1,000 people total. But, we had no one last week; last tuesday it was like 5 people. In the last week it’s been really exciting to go from having just our friends use it to meeting all of you and having more people on the app. We haven’t done a whole lot yet to spread the word since we’re still in Alpha. A (Socrates): We haven’t done very much promotion up to this point. We’ve done a little 1 on 1 promotion with guilds that Stan has done through GuildWorks. And we’ve reached out to a few other groups playing various game genres. But, we’ll be doing a larger push around the Heavensward release and you’ll be seeing Discord out there a lot very soon. Q (Xiao Shishen): Can we get little numbers to show how many people are in a given server/channel at a glance? A (Stanislav): I would love to have a glance to see how many people are on each server. Which server has people so you know where to participate. Q (uppfinnarn): How about that name? A (Jason): We picked the name because at the end of the day it just sounds cool and has to do with talking. We had a bunch of names that we bounced around, but picking a name for a product is a complicated process. You want a name that is easy to say, spell, remember, related to the function of the product, available for ™, and has a website you can get. There are a lot of things to consider and we had a number of different candidates. Discord met all the criteria that we had and we fell in love with the name. A (Socrates): And Discord in the gaming community is the problem we are trying to solve with this product. People in chat comment about the HBO show Silicon Valley. A (Stanislav): Silicon Valley is almost Jason’s life A (Jason): That show is uncomfortably real. Q (Alfie): What happens when a server goes over 1,000 users? A (Stanislav): Theoretically, if a server reaches 1000 people it will ideally reallocate you to a larger server. You can test it, we’d love to get a thousand users in a single server. Later we will have probably a soft cap and if people reach that cap we will boost it. It would be awesome if we could have a server of thousand people for server-wide channels and communities to hang out in. Q (Talren): Do you recommend using DISCORD with our guild starting now? Should we wait for final version ? I talked with guildmates they all said “we will see when they release the app.” A (Jason): I would ask: When they talk about the app, do they mean mobile or desktop. Desktop apps are available now and they should work great and hopefully you’re experiencing that now. If you’re waiting on desktop you should give it a try. They’re awesome and stable and they’re ready to go. A (Socrates): We are really out of Alpha now and should probably refer to the app as being in beta. During the Alpha stage we were doing a lot of bug squashing. Now that we’ve gone through that process the app and voice is really stable. I would say definitely get your guildmates on Discord. In my opinion, It’s already much better than other communication apps out there. And, It’s only gonna get better as we add more features. A (Stanislav): If you’re using it, you’ll notice we’re updating it every day. We’re pushing updates nonstop. Q (Lucifaz): What language was Discord coded in? A (Stanislav): The short answer is a lot. Some of the languages used are Java, Javascript C++, Erlang, Elixir, Objective C, and more. Q: (Xiao Shishen): Where can we follow upcoming news/features? A: (Socrates): Liking the Discord Facebook page or following us on Twitter are probably the best ways to get the latest info as soon as it is released. Anytime we add new features or make major changes we’ll announce them through those channels. We also have a blog you can follow (I put links to new blog posts on FB and Twitter when I make them too). Also, you may have already noticed that when you open the app and the changelog has been updated, you’ll get a popup with everything that has been changed, fixed, as well as stuff we are working on. I usually update the changelog once a week (Friday afternoon). Q (Telran): Is there anyway to identify “Server Admin” / “Channel Admin” etc? A (Stanislav): Not right now, we will add visual identifiers in the future. Q (Xiao Shishen): So I’ve noticed I have a portrait icon for DMs for a user when I have an unread DM — is there a way to pin users you DM often, or just make them stay until you dismiss them? A (Zencha): You can’t do that right now and it’s not currently a feature spec but now that you mention it… that’s a cool idea! We’ll look into it.
