Last week our developers attended another .NET User Group meeting in Donetsk and shared their experience with a number of colleagues. HTML5 development tactics were the main theme of the event. Sergey one of our Lead PHP craftsmen, made a presentation about HTML5 tools for offline applications creation. Such useful components as Web Storage, .appcache, and IndexedDB were discussed. Also, some other techniques of working with databases were touched. It’s not the first time when HTML5 becomes the topic at the User Group meeting. Given the rapid growth of HTML5 popularity all over the world, it is going to make a big impact on the web development industry in the nearest future. That’s why in Donetsk, one of Ukraine’s biggest centers of IT outsourcing, people are eager to know more about HTML5 development tactics and tips and exchange experience with their fellow developers. Binary Studio from its side eagerly cooperates with Donetsk IT community activities and supports our developers’ participation in all professional meetings.", "date": "2015-04-01"},

So, I had many tasks with creating reports using DevExpress. I’ve never liked creating reports :(. But these reports were a reason why I had an opportunity to visit customer’s office in Zurich, they  needed to to create that report ASAP. City. A huge Zurich airport met me after plane.  I don’t know metrics of the airport but it’s a huge one. It even has unmanned train inside. City has an amazing beautiful historical district. I spent a lot of time just walking on Zurich narrow streets with paving stone. Historical part has an exit to Zurich Lake. Perhaps there is nothing special. Maybe. But it is a good place to relax. Modern district of the city differs a great deal from historical part. Modern buildings are simply concrete and iron, no particular design, no fancy stuff. All stuff in Zurich is made comfortably, elaborately and easy. All roads have wide clean sidewalks. There are perfect roads, good bus stations and clean streets. Generally city looks as a rich and quality place. Food. As for me Zurich food is the most expensive food in the world. So my favorite dish was a kebab. Kebab wasn’t a sole dish; I ate in a UBS canteen at lunch time. But Zurich kebab was number one :), it’s bigger than Ukrainian shaurma in 2-3 times and it’s tasty. There are a lot of places where you can buy kebab, sausage, burger etc.  People in Zurich like snack food, many people eat food in the street, train. It’s normal for them. At least it isn’t bad. Transport. Zurich has perfect transport system. It is never late. It was so pity for me when I was only 1 minute late and couldn’t catch the train. For Ukrainian mentality this is a real challenge :). In Ukraine I have car and I need 30-40 minutes to get to work from my home (about 15km). It is hard way with traffic jams. In Switzerland I lived near Zurich in small city Dietikon. Road from home to work took me 15 minutes. I relaxed every morning. It’s so good get to work without quarrels on the road :). Office. It is an international office. People here work from many countries. You can hear English, German, French, Italian and Russian etc in the office. Funny people make friendly ambience in the office. There is even a dog :). They have places for relaxing – football table, café. I like such modern and friendly office.  But Zurich office has one lack in comparison with Binary Studio - it’s a sony play station :). I don’t know about Zurich night life. But I know they don’t like to drink vodka except my friend from Poland Andrzej. Roman, .NET Department Binary Studio", "date": "2015-04-01"},

New challenges are causing increased performance. And bigger amount of work naturally requires enhanced management and advanced planning. The question of how much of organizational is needed always remains relevant. Each business lacks resources so the task is absolutely not trivial. In software development, planning is quite essential – perhaps, more than in other business spheres. First of all, the environment is changing really fast: IT sector is one of the most rapidly evolving industries today so no wonder new standards, platforms and concepts are appearing almost daily here. As the overall capitalization of this market rises higher and higher, it widely attracts businesses. That means severe competition in the niche. Some rivals join the fight, some are forced to leave it. As a result, new solutions and technical approaches are introduced all the time. Thus the software development industry evolution is driven. And each step of this process brings the sharp need for more developers’ work, for better creativity, and for faster performance. Generally, the software solutions creating process grows more and more complex. Of course, a lot of things are automated now; modern platforms mostly support the auto-generating of low-level code. But on the other hand developers are facing more complicated tasks today. Therefore thorough planning is quite essential. During the project development objectives and goals may change many times; sometimes a developer team has just a couple of days to form a new approach to the task or, on the contrary, faces the necessity to rewrite and optimize a huge amount of code. Proactive organization is the proper way of avoiding such unpleasant situations. Project management in software development is a crucial element and thus requires lots of time & human resources. Since it is so important, business owners have to spend more money for organizational tasks. Or – as an alternative – to outsource it! Hiring dedicated teams for your project helps you to save much on management and planning.", "date": "2015-04-01"},

Our new office is located just a few floors upstairs – actually we are occupying the whole top floor of the building. The main reason for moving to a new place was lack of workspace. Since our company continues to grow and we are planning to employ more specialists in the nearest future, we had to face it – we needed a bigger office. Now each department possesses a much more spacious room with a separate exit to the balcony. To express our bright nature, our walls and pillars are colored green, yellow and orange – this looks very cool. Besides, we’ve also got some special recreation zones 🙂 Finally, a magnificent view of the city is revealed from our penthouse.

Although it was pretty rainy and much cooler than at home, I had a chance to take a walk around the city, get lost, get wet and hungry. When the conference was finished I had a terrible headache because of the information flow and a couple of new acquaintances. The social followed. Every participant of the conference was invited to have a couple of beers in a bar (see the picture below), which was specially rented for the participants. Joking…;) All the people I met were very nice and communicative and helpful. So when I came to the second day of the event I didn’t feel so odd, I felt I already knew everybody and that was awesome. It’s worth noting that there also was a third stream called “unconf”. Just a small room where you could schedule a talk and just speak up in front of those who are interested. So I went to listen to a guy from UK who taught PHP and had troubles with the curriculum i.e. he did his best to give his students knowledge so that they are competitive junior developers on the labor market when they graduate. I couldn’t help interrupting the speaker, telling about our experience and Academy Project as the solution we found. I managed to take a look at the paintings during the last day of my stay in Amsterdam. I actually had to stand around 40 minutes in a queue to get to the entrance, but it was worth it.

We can read about new models each day. What is the main factor of their success? The reason is that people have now got to  a new level of communication when distances and locations do not matter. One can connect with his or her friends or colleagues any time and from any place - may it be a car, a pub, a park, or a seashore. Therefore it's no wonder that mobile projects are often created by teams whose members are geographically separated. As more and more smart and multi-functionals devices appear in the market, the need for new applications grows really fast. That means the shortage of skilled staff in the industry. As a result mobile application development companies all over the world are clashing with each other. In such a situation market players able to create attractive solutions with lesser expenditures will succeed most of all. The problem is to hire good mobile app developers for lower rates. Eastern Europe gained many points in the world IT market during the last several years. The reason is clear: being behind Western Europe and USA in economic sphere leads to stronger investment in the most innovative industry branches. Local salaries are much lower, so high-class developers will cost much less for a local Android apps development company. As a result, mobile software vendors from Eastern Europe are today well-known in the world IT market. Thanks to the Internet, distance is not a big problem. A client from USA or Germany can make a deal with a Ukraine-based company quite easily. Currently Ukraine boasts with about the lowest price level in Europe with mature mobile apps development companies’ pool. A number of universities located in the country provide hundreds of IT graduates each year, so local mobile solutions providers have a good human resource base. Thus you can request an Android or iPad solution for your special needs here and get it quite cheap! Binary Studio has got big experience of working with customers from Western Europe and USA. We have been present in the mobile applications market for a long time already and have built up a strong team of mobile app developers. We believe that mobile solutions will play a really big role in the human life in the nearest future because mobility brings freedom for anyone.

Let me provide you with a couple of facts: Let’s see what happens next! We might pick up basketball or golf or even hockey… who knows? Why we chose football as our main sport activity? Well, one of the reasons is its team nature. Football is a very unifying thing – only a well-built team can be really successful in it. Thus it is quite similar to modern software development. As you perhaps know, Binary Studio is very keen about team-building practices. So no wonder we love this kind of game. Of course we were greatly inspired by the recent EURO 2012 championship which took place in Donetsk. We can clearly see now that football events cause immense social effect. And they unite people as well! During the EURO 2012 more than 200 thousand foreign guests have visited our city. Aside of the football games, this was an excellent opportunity to interact. The visitors en masse remained quite content with the city and overall atmosphere of the event. As for us, we went to see a couple of games too of course and did enjoy the unbelievable atmosphere!

They can cook very well but… using paper ingredients =) Yesterday Binary Studio decided to try producing pizza (!). For a couple of hours the whole staff struggled to crack the art of cooking. We had to serve as many orders as possible and to meet deadlines. As they say “ Try and fail, but don't fail to try”. So everyone tried to do his or her best to optimize the process of pizza cooking in team! Well, to tell the truth this was just Kanban training. All of us were divided into four teams or improvised pizza-bars which competed with each other. Several guys who had already experience in such events were supervising and acted as customers. The training was divided into several rounds. At the end of each round results of each team’s performance were calculated. We analyzed and discussed our achievements and fails and then each team could make a plan how to get better score at the next stage. The Pizza Game is a widespread type of Kanban training which grew rather popular as a part of Agile tactics development. Paper pizzas are to be made according to strict standards set at the beginning of the game: in case of a minor mistake a piece of pizza is thrown out and the cooks don’t receive any score for it. Moreover, the game has zero tolerance to “products” waste: all ingredients which were prepared but remained unused by the end of the round are counted and deducted from the total score. Finally, the most exciting challenge is that the deadline time for each round is unknown to players – you must always keep your eye on unused ingredients! More details about this game can be found here . Having proven its efficiency for production and service organization, the Kanban system has been very popular all over the world for a long time already. In software development the dynamic workflow organization with strong feedback is also very helpful – many projects are developed in the situations of constant re-planning, lots of new clients’ requirements etc. Another big thing is that during the game developers are taught fast teambuilding, decentralized workflow organization, constant analysis and planning, and creative approach to complex tasks. Of course we were quite hungry at the end of the game – it took lots of energy. So we decided to eat some pizza. No, we didn’t munch the paper 😉 It was real pizza, ordered in advance!

In this overview we would love to share with you more details about Mobilex and its mission. Today people are spending more time on their mobile phones than ever before. Mobile device has become one of the most popular communication tools being used by both young and old. For example, Americans on average, spend 2.7 hours per day socializing on their mobile device, that's two times more than they spend eating, and over 1/3 of the time they spend sleeping each day. The mobile phone device was built to enhance social contacts and network while enhancing business productivity. Thus, many people stopped using their mobile phones only for communication. Gross income from the mobile apps sales was around $8,5 billion in 2011, and, according to the ABI Research forecast, by 2016 the world`s mobile apps market will reach the amount of $46 billion. Thereby during next 5 years it will grow almost 6 times. Being aware of mobile market growth and feeling constantly growing demand for mobile apps development among our customers, Binary Studio established a separate branch Mobilex to keep abreast of the mobile trend. Having gathered successful experience in mobile projects we launched a new website. Please, meet MOBILEXDEVELOPMENT.COM ! The main principles of Mobilex are efficiency and openness. Decentralized methods of teamwork organization are preferred; this allows developers cooperate in a most convenient way. On the other hand rich interaction with the customer side is valued above all. The Mobilex’s clients get opportunity to choose the most appropriate schemes of team interaction and supervision. Also, Mobilex is concerned about  development of efficient team building, training methods and techniques. This includes strengthening informal ties inside team as well as encouraging additional training, team celebrations and events. Mobilex provides a broad range of mobile solutions for various device models and platforms. Its products include mobile apps for business, education, organizational management, financial operations, various leisure activities (e-books, pictures, video, music, sports & travelling), social networking, e-gaming etc. The main goal of Mobilex team helps people enjoy their mobility without any functional limitations. While a smart device enables easy connection and fast data processing, it also needs good mobile apps which allow its user  handle this data in a most non-embarrassing way.

The following aspects are shortly described in this article: why localization is needed, how it can be done and which problems you may face during localization process. It doesn’t describe any particular localization tools. Hi there, I’m Alex. Today I’d like to write about software localization basing on my experience as a support person for one widely known localization tool. Why you need multilingual software? Today there are not so many ways to sell your software since there’s lots of software almost for everything and it depends only on user preferences which tool to use for his needs. So, to sell software it must have advantages. Here are only some of possible advantages: There are many other ways to make your software popular (read – “get more money for it”) and it’s good if your software combine many advantages, but support of many languages is one of the most important and easiest from development side features that can help your software to get popularity. How to make software multilingual? There are two ways to make software multilingual: And now we’re coming to the main part… Aspects of software localization. So, what you need to know about localization? First thing – software must be localizable. This means that you must add localization support at design time. At present, almost all development platforms have special features designed to make your software localizable. This can be anything – component property, special classes, special way of storing resources, all depends on development platform, used technologies etc. Other important thing is encoding. Yep, there are still no universal encoding that is supported by all development platforms and by all environments (operating systems etc.). Unicode is close to be such a universal solution, but still not there since not all environments and development platforms support it, even among most popular platforms. For example, VCL architecture (Delphi and C++ Builder) started to support Unicode natively only starting from version 2009. And there is still a lot of software that is being developed using older versions without native support of Unicode. Of course you may say “Why do I need to support some universal encoding? I only need few languages that have same codepage”, and may be you’ll be right. That’s your choice. But then if someday you’ll want to add language with other codepage you won’t be happy to see some unreadable crap instead of text. Third thing that you will need to know is mechanism of localization for chosen development platform. Whole localization process will depend on this. Will you be able to change application language at runtime or not, will you need to localize only resource file or this will be binaries or may be you’ll have to localize source code, and even which tool to choose for localization – this all depends on localization mechanism of particular platform. Example: .NET platform version 3.x and higher has WPF technology which uses XAML to store resources in text format and BAML to store them in binary format. Problem is that BAML can be compiled from XAML only along with main assembly, i.e. it’s not possible to build localized satellite assemblies from xaml resources using 3 rd -party software, only from Visual Studio – first localize xaml resources and then build satellites from VS. And here’s another problem: from one side after localization of xaml resources user has to add all localized xaml’s to solution file (.sln) and then build assemblies. On practice this means manually adding one by one dozen of files, which is not very suitable. This could be easier if localization tool was able to update solution after writing localized files. But from other side 3 rd -party software should not change original files to avoid their corruption. As result we have to choose between two evils: to waste time on adding resources manually or localization of them from VS (not good idea) or to modify original file and if something went wrong – mess up whole project (yep, still not good idea). Of course there are tools that know some tricks how to work around such problems, but usually they are dedicated to only specific technologies. So when you’re going to make your software multilingual, first consider which tools you will use for localization and vice versa – consider possible platform-related problems when choosing tool for localization. Read documentation and don’t be shy to google for some question or ask it on specific forums if you’re not sure if there are any possible tricky things or something like this. Afterword Globalization comes to all spheres of our life and there are only two options: accept it and use all preferences of international community or reject and stay in your easy and comfy but still small and limited one-language-world. First way requires some efforts but gives more opportunities; second way is easier and secure. It’s up to you which way to choose. Just remember that you always can turn back to your small world, but you’ll never know how good it could be outside. Alexey V. Team Lead of Support Department, Binary Studio", "date": "2015-04-01"},

As in the one project I needed to show the user log file, not just a display, but follow changes. Some kind of Ajax - PHP - tail. In online mode, its output changes with ajax. The project uses CodeIgniter but it does not matter. The choice fell on the library for jQuery PeriodicalUpdater http://www.360innovate.co.uk/blog/2009/03/periodicalupdater-for-jquery/. Moreover jQuery already has been. The log file has the format: When application works, it appends log file with new strings. The idea was that we would not just send the whole file but only a new rows. HTML part: Of course do not forget to include javascript library jQuery and PeriodicalUpdater. JavaScript part responsible for the follow-up (update)  from url - index.php/admin/logs/ update. This action is only responsible for return difference (!) The first data fall into the textarea at the first boot, and then just loaded updates coming as plain text. The php part which does that: class AdminManageLogs extends CommonAdminController { The log file that handles - ./Application/log/users.log.Function index() renders the page and makes the initial filling textarea via variable Smarty ($logdata). Function update() is responsible for ajax requests and calculations of the difference. Timestamp is taken from the log file, and stored in a session with codeigniter's functions $this->session->userdata('admin_logs_update_ts') and $this->session->set_userdata( 'admin_logs_update_ts', $nextTs). Attention! If the timestamp in the log file is different from mine you will need to adjust the method _getTimestamps () Namely, the regular expression '/([0-9]){4}\\.([0-9]){2}\\.([0-9]){2}\\s([0-9]){2}:([0-9]){2}:([0-9]){2}/' because it matchs the line type 2009.11.16 08:58:52 Now, you know how to follow log files on the server with javascript and PHP.

Or maybe you want to drag and drop it in a different position within the same ItemsControl. In the end of this article we’ll able to do it in WPF MVVM application. But before beginning I want to tell you about a very interesting Bea Stollnitz blog . It’s definitely the best blog about WPF/Silverlight technology I’ve ever seen. Bea Stollnitz has worked at Microsoft for five years, helping to create the Silverlight and WPF application frameworks. She focused mostly on data binding, controls, and styles. So it is there, that I’ve found a post about drag and drop. I won’t go into any details about implementation (it’s really good code), I just want to tell how we can use it in our projects with those class. Let’s start. First of all we should copy four files from the project at the end of her post – DraggedAdorner.cs, InsertionAdorner.cs, DragDropHelper.cs and Utilities.cs. In my project it looks like this: (of course we should change namespaces). After this, within your app, you simply need to add three attached properties: And that’s all there is to it. In my application I wrote very simple products list with cart (customer can just drag and grop goods from product list to cart. I didn’t make deleting goods and other features – it’s not a goal of this article.) So MainView.xaml looks like: And MainViewModel.cs is: That’s all! As a result we have: and it works like: As you can notice, the template which we made for dragged items and total price is changed too. At the end I’ll write features and limitations as it was written by Bea. If you want to use not only ItemsControl or other panel you should just add more “if” to her code. Here is the list of features and limitations of this solution. So we’ve got what we want: “drag and drop” in WPF MVVM application. Hope it is of some help to you! (Here is source code of my project.)

General purpose of the action and result filters are .NET attributes, derived from FilterAttibute, that also implements IActionFilter or IResultFilter, or both. Also there are some good examples of creating log filters, which are also quite demanded in ASP.NET MVC software development. So, this article I’d like to tell you about creating your custom filter attribute in ASP.NET MVC (If you're looking for asp.net mvc development services , check our services page). General purpose action and result filters are .NET attributes, derived from FilterAttibute, that also implement IActionFilter or IResultFilter, or both. It’s easier to derive a subclass of the built-in ActionFilterAttibute (it is implemented in both interfaces). There are four methods you can implement: So simple filter looks like: And you can use it as: As a result you’ll see all messages which we added in filter. It was really easy, isn’t it? Now I’ll create more useful filter. This filter will save all site's activity for action method, IP, action and controller names and exception if it’ll be (I’ll use log4net lib for it but you can use any other technology for it ADO.NET Entity Framework, NHibernate, etc). So first of all I created ASP.NET MVC Web Application in MS VS 2009. After this I added LogsRequestsAttribute.cs and added following code: I don’t explain how you should add and configurate log4net in your app because it’s very simp-ly and it isn’t a goal of this article). In code I used ThreadPool object because user don’t have to wait for logging. So that’s all! Now we can use this filter in our controller or in any action: If you add filter to controller, it’ll be called for all action in it). I specially throw axception in AboutAction to check this filter for exception. As a result in log file we can see: Logging successfully initialized So as we see it works and it really simple. (BTW: you can add information in ViewData object in filter and use it on view). You can download code here. Hope it’ll help somebody! Artyom G, .NET team, Binary Studio", "date": "2021-05-18"},

Also you’ll learn how to create a Silverlight application which keeps its state between postbacks. In this article I’d like to tell you about how we can get parameters for initialization from ASP.NET environment or from other Silverlight application. ( silverlight application development services ). Silverlight application for ASP.NET environment is as “black box”. Now I’m trying to answer questions which all of us have in projects which contain not only Silverlight technology. “How can we initialize our Silverlight application” and of course “How can we get data in postback?”. Solution on first question was given to us by Microsoft – these are Silverlight parameters to initialization. When I have had second problem I found following solutions: More careful study of this information showed that hidden field and WCF-services are best variants. Let’s implement first variant. ASP.NET 3.5 has excellent facilities for this. It’s – API of HTML Bridge which gives good possibilities for working with model of web page. I developed simple Silverlight application. There are cloud tags. Users can select or deselects tags. Selected tag has other color. But now my application doesn’t have any interactions with server side. Please select few tags and make postback… Yes, all selected tags are unselected now. Of course we’d like to have other behavior. Let’s try to change it. I added asp:hiddenfield control on page with Silverlight object. Then we send our parameter (id of hidden field) to the Silverlight application (for few parameters we have to use “,”). Then we get that parameter in our Silverlight application. There is StartupEventArgs object with our parameters as a dictionary in Applcation_Startup method. And now we get that parameter in MainPage class. Finally we’ll use HTML bridge. On selected event we’ll add id’s of selected tags to the hiddenfield as value. And of course we should add a method which gets data from parameters on creating MainPage. As you can see, it’s really simple. And we got that desirable behavior! (You can download source code here) It’s good but not really effective. This code can be improved by introducing asynchronous work. We can make it by using web-services since Silverlight 2 support these technologies. IMHO WCF-services is best choice for that task because this type of services work faster than other and these services are more flexible to configure through attributes. So I added new interface in project. All class which will implement that interface can be used as WCF-service because of attributes. We should add service reference for our WCF-service in Silverlight application. Visual studio automatically creates proxy-class for that reference. Of course we should create and start host for using WCF-services in our project. NOTE: Silverlight doesn’t support WSHttpBinding, so we should use BasicHttpBinding. Than we should change Page ctor. As we see Visual Studio created asynchronous wrappers because Silverlight works with services only asynchronously. But when we try to run application now, we get error because Silverlight isn’t allowed to contact with services on other domains if those services don’t have policy files. It’s cross-domain access. So I added new interface for our WCF-service… ... and develop method which gives client access policy file. Don’t forget to add it to the host. Then we should only add handler for asynchronous wrapper: Artyom G, .NET team, Binary Studio", "date": "2021-05-18"},

This artucle deals with adding new interactivity to your Silverlight 3 application, without having to write code. It also covers the question of using a rich API to write your own behaviors for Silverlight and WPF projects. Hello, today I would like to talk about some features of Silverlight 3, which in my opinion cannot be overlooked - it is Behaviors. Before proceeding to the practical application development I would like to speak a little about what is Behaviors and where they are used. So what does Behavior mean? Behavior - is a definite functional unit which can be added to some element of Silverlight, to increase its interactivity. To make it clear, I will show you the application of the standards of Behavior (MouseDragElementBehavior). As we see from the example, MouseDragElementBehavior allows you to drag image, on the application area, thereby extending its functionality. This and many other Behaviors can be found in the installation Microsoft.Expression.Interactions. Apart from that, there is an additional possibility of adding our own Behavior in Silverlight 3, and this is what we are going to do in this article. First you need to install the following elements: For example, let’s do Behavior for the TextBox, which is hiding its content with the Blur effect. First – we need to create a project in Expression Blend 3. It also can be done in Visual Studio 2008. Then we need to add the Behavior class to the project. To do it, we need to go to the menu File -> New item ... and choose one of the Behaviors in the displayed list. These methods are made for the events registration and removal. In the method OnAttached we will sign the event GotFocus and LostFocus and in the method OnDetaching respectively we will delete them. That's what we eventually got. In my opinion, there's no need to explain anything, from the code we have I believe everything is clear. Well, now it’s easier, we need to throw on form several TextBox and add Behavior to them. Look what happened. Well, that’s basically all for this article. I hope my example is of some help to those who are also excited at Silverlight and its possibilities.

Also here you can see example of advanced routing based on web-forms. Error-handling for almost all errors included. As you know, we do a lot of .NET development here at Binary Studio. We had a task to create JSON service based on posted web pages which corresponds to specified format. Purpose of this task was to connect some legacy sites to one network with single data storage. Corresponding to that we have already /*specified*/ protocol specification. Request specification: Calls to service were implemented as posted web form requests with specified HTTP headers: Web service should be able to detect request forgery. Here in the article we'll use a simplified check: timestamp should not differ from current server time more than specified time. Default value- one minute. Request parameters passes as POST parameters as multipart/form-data. Name of service call method passes as post parameter named \"call\" User identifier (in DB) passes as parameter \"user\" Other site always waiting for result returned as JSON object with two fields: As you can see, we have such tasks: And additional requirement: 4. Good test coverage, which allow us to check everything before server will go to production (this should be “hot replace”) I will describe how we solved first three tasks here. The test story will be covered in the next article. We found an elegant solution for this task with ASP.NET MVC.  It has everything we need: I start from solving our first problem: We needed to route not standard http request, which have fixed URL, but pass needed params from headers and form data. As I already told, MVC has good routing possibilities and we need to add our custom route there. We will take data from HttpContext.Request, it has all needed data already parsed and stored in collections. HttpHeaders we can get from and  form data with Сreation of our custom routing  will take 2 steps: 1. Create custom route class which get request data and put it to “controller” and “action”. Just add this class to Global.asax 2. Add our new class to RegisterRoutes method in Global.asax: As you can see, MVC routing is a powerful tool which allows you not only configure url as you want, but handle more difficult cases like http headers, form data and whatever you need. Next thing we do is request validation. For that purpose we used custom HTTPModule, which allowed us check request and return error messages (if needed) even before routing. This task can be solved in two steps too: 1. Create class of http module. Http modules are a powerful tool, which will allow you to catch a lot of application events. This class binds to BeginRequest event handler. Now we can check our request at first stage (even before routing). We just get http header from request, as we do that in routing, and verify data as we want 2. We need to register module in web-server. Add this string to <HttpModules> section in Web.config Now every request to your site will be checked before processing. This can be useful if you need to build highly loaded sites protected from unauthorized access. Our third task was to return answer even if service returns error. Of course, we could write every method with error handling, but this way produces big bunch of code, which is not very good for support. Instead of this we have made handler, which get lambda expression, process it and handles errors Now our controller methods use lambda expressions and look like this It just a little more difficult than usual. We can add a little improvement, that allow us to write more simple code. This method returns object wrapped as JsonResult Add it to your controller, and write: Now we can handle all errors in service methods, but still have a hole: What will happen if wrong params will be passed to method? Or how we handle any other error? For that purpose we can create two  walls of error handling: Often error can happen when method parameter name or type don’t matches with passed in request. For that purpose we can override OnException method in controller. Our implementation catches ArgumentException, return standart error message and log detailed information: At last stage we should handle all other errors which can happen in our server. Easiest way to do this is to add Application_Error method. We don’t have JsonResult here, so we should write answer manually. Note, that I set StatusCode and StatusDescription to “200 OK”, it helps us to return normal answer in all cases (even if you have 404 or 500 error) So, what we have in result? We have web application, that applies to all our requirements. You can dowload sample solution here . Denis P., .NET team, Binary Studio", "date": "2021-05-18"},

I must say that such method is huge, but helpful. Everything what I said is based on C++98 standard, but I think you have already heard about C++11 standard. At least I have mentioned it a couple of times in my previous articles. This standard has some good stuff for you which helps to write compile-performed code without templates. It has name constexpr and is a shortening of constant expression. Today I will use this one from C++11 and write similar code as before, but much smaller. Yep, I will re-implement calculation of my mathematics series at compile-time in a more elegant way. Let's see. New keyword constexpr or mark for compiler As in previous time I'm beginning with an example of factorial calculation. Now it resembles a regular recursive implementation of factorial. Take a look at the following code: Last time it took approximately 18 lines. Currently you see 4 lines (yes, I counted brackets) and it has only one new thing for you: a constexpr keyword. This keyword is a hint for compiler that result of this function can be evaluated at compile-time. It has some usage restrictions, but will'll discuss them later. Let's see how we can use it at first. Probably some of you will write the following code: and will expect assignment of result of calculation a factorial to value variable at compile-time. I want to look under the hood into an assembler code of such function. Don't worry it won't hurt you. I will add some comments for better understanding. My compiler generates the following assembler instructions for SomeFunc: Wait a minute... We were expecting that everything would be calculated at compile-time and to see just the result generated assembly, but we see that calculation will be performed at run-time. If you try to debug this code, you will be able to enter in FactorialExpr() function and see calculation. Do you think I lied when said about calculation at compile-time? Of course no. Check out the correct code: and assembly code now looks like the following: Do you see this? There is no call of FactorialExpr function. Here is just putting ready result to the variable. Really factorial of 4 is 24, which we see in the assembly code. We got this when we added constexpr keyword for the variable. So at the moment we know that constexpr can be used for functions and variables and they interact. It is time to say about rules of this keyword. Rules of constexpr Let's begin with the simplest - using constexpr for variables. It has the following rules: Before describing of constexpr functions I need to give definition of literal type. It can be: OK, now you are ready to see rules for functions\\methods with constexpr keyword: There is harder story with constexpr constructors. Constructor of class can be declared with constexpr like function as well, but with following additional rules: As you see constexpr can be used for simple situations needed for evaluating code at compile-time. C++14 standard expands possible actions with constexpr, but for me it is enough to rewrite calculation of mathematics series from my previous article with C++11. Re-implementing calculation of mathematics series We already have implementation of factorial, now it is turn of exponentiation. As with factorial thanks to constexpr it is very easy: As in previously I have written a wrapper for hiding start state of variable that keeps serial multiplying base on its value \"degree\" times. I don't think that there is something to review more, because there is elementary realization by recursive calls of PowerExprImpl function. Now we can write code for calculation of single series: Here we just call other constexpr function and divide each other with casting from int to double to prevent losing of necessary information. For implementing mathematics series we need an accumulator. There it is: There is one unusual thing – the first argument of the function. It is a pointer to function and it can be used in constexpr function because pointer is a scalar type. If you don't know syntax of such pointers in C++, you can read about this here . Now we have everything what we need to finish implementation of the calculation. Get into this: Here &SingleSerieExpr is getting of function address which I have mentioned above. The rest is a wrapper with call of the accumulator with correct arguments and usage of wrapper with some data. If you look at an assembler code of MathematicsSeriesCompileTime(), you will see something like this: You see? We get same results as we did it with help of templates in previous article[ link here ], but this time our implementation is more understandable for programmer. Thanks to new constexpr keyword from C++11 standard. Conclusion Calculation at compile-time by usage of templates is great, but in such case programmer writes code which is hard to understand for other programmers. Such implementation can be huge and bulky. C++11 standard has pretty cool instrument for avoiding this. It has name constexpr, which means constant expression. In this article I have described rules of usage this keyword and abused my previous implementation for calculation of mathematics series by writing small and clear code with constexpr. So if your compiler supports C++11, it is an awesome practice to use new constexpr keyword with the Force. As usual examples of code from the article you can find in my Github repository.

First of all let's say that social authorization is very popular and frankly speaking  it's really handy tool. Surfing internet we can see a lot of sites and services which offer login with Facebook, Twitter, Google and other social networks. Quite frequently when building and maintaining web-sites a question of choosing appropriate tool/package/library arises. And there is a great amount of them. If you're building your website in PHP using Laravel, probably you've noticed Socialite which provides OAuth / OAuth 2 authentication with Facebook, Twitter, Google, and GitHub. The most famous social network which provides OAuth2 authentication in Russian segment of the internet is vk . But there is a lack of such connector (provider) in Socialite library. Actually it's not a hard problem, so let's build new VkProvider on top of Socialite's components. Before we start building new provider please make sure you got the idea of OAuth2. Below is a cheat-sheet for the common workflow. In order to use vk authorization for our app we need to create a standalone application. For more information please check this link . After you created the app you should pay attention to the settings in red boxes on image below. In terms of Laravel we need to put these values under new section in services.php . Like this: Then we need to add Socialite library to our project dependencies. In order to create new provider we need to extend AbstractProvider and implementProviderInterface according to Socialite's source code. In general UML-diagram will look like this: From this diagram we can notice that we need to implement 4 methods in our FooProvider . After spending some time with VK api docs my VKProvider class was extended with more methods: Vk's response contains not only access_token but also user's email (which will be cool to keep for our further needs), so we can override parseAccessToken() and user() in order to attach email to user's info. Class code: Now, we are almost ready to use this provider. But nevertheless one thing is left to do. The last thing we need to do is register SocialiteServiceProvider . According to the official docs we need to add it to config/app.php . This is the part where things get slightly complicated. Default service provider via dependency injection produces SocialiteManager class which doesn't know about our new VkProvider . That's why we will do the trick. After inspecting SocialiteManager code I realized that it was inherited from Laravel's Manager class which allows to add new drivers (providers) via extend() method. So lets create new service provider called SocialitePlusServiceProvider where we will register new driver for vk. So that's it. Now we can add SocialitePlusServiceProvider in config/app.php and we are good to start using it in accordance with the documentation provided by Laravel. Files which were added to the project with appropriate folders: In order to check how our new provider works let's create dummy example in routes.php : If everything went fine you will receive similar dump: So, you can use retrieved info in your app's authorization process. Also, on Laravel News I found that company DraperStudio has implemented 70 oauth(2) drivers for different social services. However, they use Observer Pattern approach in order to register new providers. They also implemented Vkontakte provider which is pretty similar to introduced above.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "flutter-3", "author": ["Denis Beketsky"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2020/06/23/flutter-3/", "abstract": "Just recently, Flutter 1.17 was released and it brings a lot of cool features. You can read more about it here . It comes with lots of performance improvements, new Widgets, and more. But, besides all that, this version of Flutter also got one small, but a very useful feature: compile-time variables. Yes, you heard me, starting from 1.17 you can build your Android and iOS application with predefined, compile-time variables that can be used in all layers of your applications — Dart, iOS, Android. Update 28.05.2020 : Added notes about *.xcconfig limitations in iOS paragraph. Update 05.08.2020: Added code example that compatible with Flutter 1.20. More about changes in Flutter 1.20 you can read here . If you are working with Flutter Web, you may know the Flutter Tool argument --dart-define . Primarily it was used to enable Skia for the Flutter Web like this --dart-define=FLUTTER_WEB_USE_SKIA=true . But what you may not know, is that starting from 1.17 you can pass multiple custom key/value pairs there. For example, if you run the flutter app with the following arguments flutter run --dart-define=SOME_VAR=SOME_VALUE --dart-define=OTHER_VAR=OTHER_VALUE then you can get these values in your Dart code like this And use this class as your Environment specific config all over the project. This means that now you can get rid of packages like environment_config . If you don’t know what this package does, you can read this article on how to configure Flutter environment in the proper way . Short answer — yes, you can use these variables in native too but… it’s a little bit trickier. If you are curious how Flutter passes Dart Defines into the native layers, you can take a look at the Flutter Tools package . It treats Dart Defines in a slightly different way for each platform but, I will show you examples for iOS and Android builds. Also, keep in mind that starting from Flutter 1.20, Flutter Tool changed the way in which format Dart Defines are passed to the native layer. To do so, I created a Flutter project that defines the Application Name and Application Suffix ID for Android and iOS based on Dart Defines variables. master branch is compatible with Flutter 1.20, and flutter-1.17 — compatible with Flutter .1.17 This app works with just two compile-time variables which are DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_NAME and DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_SUFFIX . I would recommend adding a prefix to every compile-time variable just to avoid conflicts with variables that Flutter uses. In this example, I’m using DEFINEEXAMPLE_* . The application is quite simple. If you open main.dart you will see that it defines EnvironmentConfig class , and prints it’s value . You can notice that I used awesomeApp as a default value for DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_NAME . We’re going to use this default value in all layers, including native. As for APP_SUFFIX — we will get an actual Application ID ( packageName ) in the FutureBuilder Widget from package_info plugin. And if DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_SUFFIX is defined, you will see the Application ID on your screen. One important note : ensure that you are assigning environment variables to the const fields. Currently, Flutter has an issue if a non-const variable was used. When you run this application with a command like flutter run --dart-define=DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_NAME=awesomeApp1 --dart-define=DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_SUFFIX=.dev You should see next: You can notice that it rendered awesomeApp1 , which was passed from the arguments instead of the default awesomeApp . And com.example.defineexample. dev . Where .dev — defined Suffix. Ok, so to pass compile-time variables into Android we will need to use Flavors. No worries! No Flavors, no tons of iOS Schemes, no multiple entries, and no copy/paste… well, except for default values for different layers. 🤷🏻‍♂ So, for Android, Flutter Tool passes all Dart Defines as a single string value, joined with a comma. In Flutter 1.17 in your Gradle, you will get a String value like: DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_NAME=awesomeApp1,DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_SUFFIX=.dev And in Flutter 1.20 value will be like this: DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_NAME%3Dawesome1,DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_SUFFIX%3D.dev The case here that starting from Flutter 1.19 Flutter Tool encodes URI symbols before Dart Defines are passed to the compiler, including = that is why instead of this symbol you see %3D in the Dart Define item. So we will need to parse it before we can use each key-value pair. Full gradle code can be found here . Flutter passes Dart Defines in the project properties with dart-defines key. For Flutter 1.17 parse logic will look like this: First, it defines defaults (lines 1–4), then, converts a string from dart-defines into Map and merges the result with defaults. For Flutter 1.20 we will need additionally decode each item so we could properly split it on key-value pair (line 5): So now we can define resValue and applicationIdSuffix. After we defined String resource it can be used for example in your android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml to specify Application Name. But basically, you can use this set of values anywhere in your project. And now if you take a look at your application on the Android device, you can notice that the application name was successfully defined: Also as Package Name During iOS build, Flutter Tool creates a couple of files, including Generated.xcconfig and flutter_export_environment.sh . They can be found in ios/Flutter . Those files are in gitignore by default, so GitHub project won’t contain them. But after the build, you will find Dart Defines in those files, defined like this for Flutter 1.17: And for Flutter 1.20 they will be defined with encoded values like it was in the Gradle: Since this format can’t be used for plist, to define Application Name and Application ID Suffix, we need to define new variables, based on Dart Defines . So let’s start. iOS *.xcconfig has some limitations when it comes to variable values. You can read about it here or google for a probable solution. But basically, it treats the sequence // as a comment delimiter. This means that you won’t be able to specify API_URL for example like this https://example.com since everything after // will be ignored. In the same time, if you run your build with the following argument: Flutter Tools will create flutter_export_environment.sh file with the following row: Also as Generated.xcconfig with the following: So in your build Pre-Action (you will read about it in the next paragraph), you can try to figure out a workaround how to get actual value of DART_DEFINES to provide proper parsing of API_URL if you want to. With Flutter 1.20 situation will be similar since we will decode values before parse, but since Dart Define item will be encoded (including // ) it will be easier to figure out a workaround how you want to parse such items. Because, unlike Flutter 1.17, you will actually receive your Dart Define value so you no need to think how to get this value for parse. 1. Create Defineexample-defaults.xcconfig file with defaults: 2. Import it in Debug and Release configurations And also let’s import config file that we will create in just a few moments: Consider putting Defineexample.xcconfig after Defineexample-defaults.xcconfig , so values from Flutter Run command could override default values. 3. Edit your plist file and define Bundle name from DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_NAME and Suffix from DEFINEEXAMPLE_APP_SUFFIX Now it’s time to create Defineexample.xcconfig. To create it we need to add Pre-Build action to the iOS build. 4. Edit Schema: 5. Add Pre-Action: with the following command if you use Flutter 1.17: Or the following command if you use Flutter 1.20: The explanation why exact this bash script is needed you can find in this article . During the build, this command will create the following Defineexample.xcconfig file: You can choose different *.xcconfig file names if you want to. Just ensure that they won’t be modified by Flutter Tool scripts. Also, keep in mind limitations of *.xcconfig if you need to respect // during the parse. When the application will be installed on your device, you can notice that it has a name, that we defined during the build: Also as Package Name: Same as with Android, now you can use this set of values anywhere in your project.

However, in recent years the industry has greatly evolved and many providers have greatly invested in the quality of their services. While there are always advantages and disadvantages and it is always important to carefully consider the pros and cons, IT decision-makers increasingly leverage outsourcing companies as an enabler for business growth. Rather than focusing on financial aspects, in this article, we will look at ways to utilize outsourcing software development services to unlock additional business value. 1) Add new skills and know-how Many businesses start looking for external providers when their projects require complex skillsets or know-how that they do not have readily available and where developing these capabilities in-house is simply not feasible. By teaming up with an external partner who has a proven track record of excellence, customers can build cutting edge solutions in the latest technologies without having to master them themselves. 2) Work with amazing talent With great talent being in high demand, attracting exceptional engineers can be incredibly difficult. For most companies, building a truly outstanding team requires either a huge amount of recruitment effort or the help of external partners. Leveraging the services of a premium league outsourcing provider is a great way of getting fast access to engineers at a level of quality that would be extremely hard to find on Western job markets. 3) Improve development processes Adding external developers to your team can be a great opportunity to improve your current development processes. Good remote developers are not only fluent in agile methodologies, best practices, and design patterns, they will also readily offer valuable advice on these topics. 4) Bring in a fresh perspective Writing great software frequently requires trying new approaches and out-of-the-box thinking. By adding external members to your team, you will almost certainly profit from hearing new perspectives. More often than not, your remote team members might surprise you with unexpected feedback and fresh ideas on how to improve your project. 5) Focus on business goals Most businesses do not consider hiring and managing developers among their core competencies or revenue drivers. Leaving these complex activities to an outsourcing partner removes a major distraction and frees up time in the calendar that you can spend on more critical tasks at the heart of your business. 6) Reduce time to market In fast-paced business environments where it is crucial to innovate quickly and being first in the market can be a critical factor for success, an outsourcing company is a great solution to gain control over the speed of your software development. Rather than letting your available resources dictate the timelines, you can quickly scale your remote team to move forward much faster. 7) Improve product quality Scaling your remote team with the goal of building a more robust solution and including a capacity for thorough testing will greatly increase product stability and lead to a much better user experience. Improving the quality of your code not only generates a lot of value but also helps to protect your investment in light of future requirements. While each of these benefits in itself can compel a project owner to turn to outsourcing, this list is of course far from complete and I would love to hear your opinion. When you worked with outsourcing providers in the past, did you profit from your partnerships in unexpected ways? Or do you still see outsourcing companies mainly as a way to shop for the cheapest commodity developers?

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "freelancers-vs-agencies-pros-cons", "author": ["Edward Robe"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2017/04/24/freelancers-vs-agencies-pros-cons/", "abstract": "With the demand for tech talent at an all-time high, many companies are looking to expand their hiring pool by searching outside of their local area, which has been one of the major reasons for the expansion of the outsourcing industry. For those looking to take advantage of global talent, an important question is whether to hire individual freelancers or to seek an agency with which to set up a more formal collaboration. A lot of the CTO’s and tech leads that I speak with look cautiously at working with agencies, believing that they are unnecessarily expensive compared to individual freelancers - after all, an agency has overhead to consider, and why should you pay for another company’s HR staff or administrative costs when you could just hire directly? In fact, there’s a fair amount of pros and cons with hiring freelancers over agencies, which I’d like to address in this post. Now obviously I’m fairly biased - being an employee of a software development company , I clearly lean towards giving preference to agencies. But prior to working at Binary Studio , I was a freelancer for nearly four years, and also hired freelancers for individual projects during that time. I can tell you with sincerity that there are times when one of the options will be more suited to your project than the other. Let’s take a look at the factors and compare both models one by one: If you are looking at strictly the dollar figure you will spend to employ a developer, freelancers will win out almost every time against agencies. The reason is simple - overhead! Freelancers have no major overhead costs that they need to consider when quoting you a price. Agencies, on the other hand, need to pay for office space, administrators, managers, marketing, accounting, HR staff, and all the rest. That stuff costs money and is added to the total cost of hiring an agency to help you with your project. This is why when you are given two equally talented developers to choose from, the individual freelancer will almost certainly be cheaper than the agency-employed one. However, once you start considering the hidden costs of recruiting freelancers, the scales tip a bit. Firstly, you need to consider the time, energy, and money spent on recruitment. Hiring good developers over the internet is an exhausting process, and a much different process compared to hiring in house staff. If your project aims to grow and you anticipate expanding your development team, you are going to need to go through the recruitment process every time you seek to add a new member. Not to mention the setbacks you will have when one of your original freelancers gets tired or decides to work on a different project, in which case you will need to employ your own HR/recruitment staff to find a suitable replacement. Then the question becomes: is it worth paying the outsourcing development team to handle that for you, or to bear that burden yourself? Also worth noting is that each freelancer is going to have to do their own accounting, marketing, and workspace. Naturally, they will work that into the cost of their salary. However, that is time and resources spent on work that is not software development, so in a way, you are going to be paying for that twice as you are losing valuable development time from your programmer and paying him to do stuff which isn’t programming related. Ouch! A lot of companies look for employees who fit their very particular idea of the ideal candidate. If your project requires a technical person with a strong background in something non-technical, for example, then you might be better suited for a custom-tailored freelancer who has experience with that subject. Let’s say you are looking for a developer who is also an amateur musician to help you work on your music recording app. Someone with a strong technical background but no interest in music production is probably not going to appeal to you! I will tell you now that agencies generally don’t have the qualifications to find these “unicorn” developers - they may have strong standards for technical and communication skills, but they will be hard-pressed to find such a specific person for you. You might get lucky and find a team that has worked on a similar project, but not necessarily one that is filled with music recording enthusiasts - that would be a rare unicorn indeed! Here’s another example from personal experience - let’s say you need a native Russian speaker who is living in low-cost Eastern Europe but will work and be on call during Pacific Standard daytime. Eastern European agencies will have a hard time advertising for such a position (“Looking for a skilled developer who is also a vampire willing to work graveyard shifts!”) and will be hesitant to hire someone for such a specific role, but there will always be some individual freelancers who will rise to the challenge and work with your specific requirements. That being said, if you come across an agency that has done a project which fits closely to what you are looking to do, you can draw from their previous experience, perhaps even more so than from an individual freelancer. Agencies work together in teams, and even though some developers might be working on different projects, they all eat in the same kitchen and share their problems and solutions with each other. This can also bring fresh ideas to the table which you wouldn’t normally get from a single freelancer, or provide quick answers to problems which a single freelancer might spend a long time clearing up due to his lack of support network. This is somewhat of a toss-up - you can have good working relationships with both freelancers and agencies, but they certainly differ a bit in their nature. Freelancers by definition are non-committal - they work for a set period of time and then are expected to go their own way when one or both parties see fit to end the contract. Many freelancers are so by choice because they don’t want to get stuck in a long-term project that will become mundane and boring after the first few months. Others prefer to keep their options open, dabbling in a variety of different tech stacks and platforms to buff up their portfolio, build references, and eventually demand a higher salary. Granted, you can hire on the freelancer as a full-time employee, but then you run into the problem of providing all that overhead and commitment yourself, which may not fit into your budget or business plan. Still, you can develop a close, albeit short-term relationship with a freelancer which may very well end up becoming a long-term engagement if the project pans out and your circumstances allow it. Meanwhile, working with agencies is a very different matter. They will always be interested in your project and continuing collaboration, assuming their business model doesn’t change drastically out of the blue. Although individual developers may come and go, the company will always try and put forth a suitable replacement in order to keep doing business with you. This accommodates very long-term relationships as the company will have a vested interest in staying with you, since they won’t get bored or tired of the project, and they will try to do everything in their power to keep you satisfied. Freelancers, on the other hand, will be happy to leave if they feel they’ve outgrown the project or can get more money elsewhere. This is an area where I believe the agency wins, hands down. Making sure there is a third party between the client and developer to ensure the programming team is keeping up on their side of the bargain is one of the greatest strengths of hiring an agency to work on a project. They can keep track of the hours, quality, and feedback from the client in order to make sure everything is completed to standard. For particularly complex products, it’s absolutely crucial to have this accountability in place, otherwise, you are going to waste a lot of time checking in on your freelancers to see whether they are doing everything the way you want it done. It’s a lot easier to go through one project manager who is overseeing a team of developers in his own office than it is to individually check in with several different freelancers, each with their conflicting interests and projects that they are worried about. Another thing to consider is that when a freelancer drops a project, they cause a huge disruption among the remaining team that an agency can cope with much better. Integrating a new freelancer into a project is difficult - if it happens too much, people will lose the feeling of project ownership and obligation to produce a high-quality product. Worst-case scenario - enough freelancers will jump ship that it causes the rest of the team to abandon the project as they lose hope that it will ever be finished! This is why all big projects with 10-20+ person development teams either work in-house or hire an agency. Freelancers are just too fickle to manage at that level, and hiring an agency to handle the internal management will inevitably be worth the extra overhead when compared to managing a group of freelancers. Even smaller projects can benefit from this added level of accountability. If you don’t have a tech background and hire an individual person to create an app for you, it’s going to be your word against his if the product doesn’t turn out the way you want. The freelancer can always be content with walking away and finding another project to work on, as he’s already been paid - and you will be the one stuck with the costs! However, a good, reputable agency will go out of their way to communicate things between you and the development team, and will not hesitate to replace personnel if something goes wrong and standards are not being met. People get sick, family emergencies happen - and an agency will cope with this for you as opposed to leaving you high and dry with an unfinished project. This added level of security is one of the greatest reasons to consider hiring an agency over a freelancer. Depending on the size, scope, and requirements for your project, both freelancers and agencies can provide you the tech talent necessary to get your product on the market in a timely and efficient manner. Just bear in mind the advantages and disadvantages of both and make sure to choose the one most suitable to the task at hand:", "date": "2020-11-12"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "identify-great-junior-developer", "author": ["Kateryna Semenista"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2017/11/23/identify-great-junior-developer/", "abstract": "Finding great employees is always an arduous, time consuming, and risky endeavor. But when it comes to hiring people with little or no experience - the complexity and hazard of the challenge may be multiplied. And if we add to this the equation the time needed for onboarding and mentorship required for any junior, the wrong choice of a person can result in a waste of money, time, or even worse - opportunity. Below I will share some of Binary Studio’s best practices regarding how we spot outstanding junior talent and make sure they are capable of performing in our environment and up to the expectations we set. In our experience, the puzzle of a successful hire is solved by answering three questions: Can the junior developer do the job? Unlike entry level candidates, junior developers know the fundamentals (or are supposed to know) of software development. So the task here is to actually identify what the junior already knows and whether that will be sufficient for tasks of your project’s complexity. At Binary Studio, before inviting junior candidates for an interview, we first ask them to complete a test task (e.g. write a simple application from scratch), which helps us save lots of time by filtering out people who a) are not enthusiastic/interested/motivated enough to do the task and therefore get a job here, and b) whose technical expertise does not meet our expectations. A junior might not have even developed a small application from scratch before, and though the task may be difficult, the candidates show their ability to learn quickly and independently, which is a crucial skill for the juniors. Test Task Tip: If you decide to offer a test task (which we highly recommend), choose a simple application; be specific regarding your expectations (define three or four obligatory features and name the technologies you’d like to be used). Ideally, the test task should not take a candidate more than twelve to fifteen hours to complete. Also, it’s a good practice of ours to actually name the criteria we are going to evaluate in the test task. For JS developers they could look like this: A scoreboard like this will help you both define your criteria for the junior developer and have a clear picture of the candidate’s skills after the assessment. There is another benefit of a test task. I believe that after candidates perform the test task some sort of commitment bias comes into force, which makes them be a little bit more attached to the company and a little bit more serious about their application for it. Within the last couple of years, we’ve had two hires who didn’t show up for their first day. Both happened to not do the test task before they received the job offers (and both were outbound hires rather than inbound, meaning that we contacted them to offer the job, as opposed to them applying for it first).  Even though they were not necessarily software developers, this greatly reinforced our strategy of using test tasks before hiring junior candidates. Binary Studio Stats: to hire one great junior, out of thirty-ish applicants we check around ten to fifteen test tasks and invite four to six candidates who coped well with the task for an interview.  The whole recruitment process may take six to nine weeks. Will this developer do the job? Another question is much deeper, literally. It’s whether the candidate is motivated enough to work hard, learn and accept feedback. The Iceberg Model of Competencies: I personally believe that past results are very often a good enough indicator of future performance, which is why during the interviews we dwell a lot on the candidate’s achievements in university, their extracurricular activities and what portion of their free time is devoted to self development (what tech books they’ve read, what courses they’ve passed, and which ones they’d like to take in the future). We also talk about their aspirations and ambitions as well as ask situational / behavioral questions.  For example, we ask them if they had a couple of job offers, what would be the 3 criteria they would base their decision on? We ask them to name them in order of importance. We may also ask the candidate to describe their perfect job, company, and work environment. We want to know which factors are the most important to them. Different studies mention different time frames within which an interviewer forms an impression of a candidate which will influence a hiring decision, the range varies from 5 seconds to 15 minutes. With juniors it’s very important to give it more time and not to form a decision too fast, because the task is to evaluate potential, and to do that you need to give the opportunity to the developer to break through subjective filters and demonstrate why they’d be a good candidate. At Binary Studio, we divide interviews into two parts: one with an HR Manager, and one with a Senior Developer or a Tech Lead. Each part lasts not less than forty minutes, which in our opinion, is optimal to get a pretty good idea if the candidate fits. Is he or she a good culture match? Culture fit is just as important to screen for during the interview as skills fit. To ensure a great hire, determine which values you want to see in your future teammate before you begin interviewing. Then, think of the best culture fit interview questions to properly evaluate each candidate. Over time at Binary Studio we’ve developed a portrait of an ideal candidate which guides and helps us make hiring decisions. While being open for diversity of characters, skills and ideas, our portrait serves us as a minimum viable set of skills, so to say. Portrait of a Binary Studio Junior Developer: The main goal of the HR manager interview at Binary Studio is to get the understanding of to what extent the candidate fits the portrait. To do that, we ask a lot of situational questions (e.g. Tell me about a time when you took responsibility without being asked / coped with a big challenge / received an unfair negative feedback, etc.) as well as simple general questions about hobbies, last read book, travels, university experience, etc. Summing up In identifying great talents, every company’s journey will be different, depending on its own culture and priorities. And since hiring is more an art than a science, even with a very careful and thorough recruitment process, you will still have successes and failures, but as long as you learn from the latter, you can be assured that you’re on the right path.", "date": "2020-07-09"},

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "risk-management-in-outsourcing", "author": ["Binary Studio"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2013/06/19/risk-management-in-outsourcing/", "abstract": "Nearshore software development can be an extremely profitable option, but it is not a silver bullet. As with any new business venture, there are real risks and challenges, many of which are highlighted by distance. With so many options to choose from, it is critical to be as fully informed as possible in order to find a great match. The first major question is what type of cooperation model is best and where to look. While relying on freelancers for small or non-critical projects is often a great option, when development work is more significant, long term cooperation with a trusted overseas development company may be a more secure choice. Larger firms may ramp up development quickly, but can be less dedicated to their customers over the long run. Firms with real experience can help structure projects to maximize efficiency and reduce your uncertainty by recruiting, training and focusing on retention so you don’t have to. When outsourcing software development, the three primary worries are ineffective communication, technical inexperience, and weak motivation. Partnering with a reliable firm can help to address the first two, while effective project management is needed for the third. COMMUNICATION In complex external projects, mutual understanding comes from effective communication during long term cooperation. With developers in a foreign country, potential issues include not only workers’ language skills and understanding of project requirements, but also their ability to understand the customer’s way of thinking. Cultural differences can sometimes affect developers’ work attitudes. For example, anecdotal evidence suggests that East European developers are more likely to proactively evaluate assignments looking for better ways to complete them. Video and VoIP services give managers the ability to respond to questions immediately or with little delay and to hold regular meetings. Use of Scrum procedures can help keep everyone on the same page. Adjusting shift schedules can increase workday overlap, although minimizing the time zone difference is overall more effective. Overall, working within Europe may minimize miscommunication. At the same time, there is no substitute for face to face meetings when it comes to establishing and reinforcing a relationship between employer and developer. Companies looking to start an overseas project should be aware that personally meeting programmers during the project kick-off stage and over the course of later collaboration will be very beneficial. They should therefore investigate the possibility of hosting workers onsite or of traveling to the offshore development facility. EXPERIENCE The problem of finding suitably experienced developers is sometimes part of what drives companies to consider outsourcing in the first place. Locating developers with desired skills, knowledge and dedication can present a serious challenge and a major time commitment. Furthermore, it is also necessary to make sure that programmers’ knowledge stays up to date. Fortunately, outsourcing can actually alleviate some of these problems, so long as companies are very careful when choosing prospective partners to work with. Make sure to focus on the people to be hired, as well as on the selection process. Strong STEM education in many outsourcing countries provides access to a talented pool of developers. While it is not always possible to find programmers who have an exact set of project-specific knowledge, outsourcing providers excel at finding skilled individuals with the aptitude to quickly build on their experience. Find out about options for knowledge sharing, training, and skill development. If developers are capable and quick to learn, and have an effective support network, it is likely that they will contribute effectively on your team. SUSTAINING MOTIVATION After you have made a massive investment of time and effort evaluating, training, and learning to work with your crew, the last thing that you want is for them to leave or become unmotivated. Little can be more disruptive to your project’s progress or to your bottom line. This potential risk can be minimized by effective project management and by thinking about task selection. Your overseas partner should also be a valuable resource if they are truly committed to keeping retention high. Involve your nearshore workers in the process: effectively integrating them into your company will keep them working at their best. Give them necessary work that challenges them to learn and be creative. Unless you simply want faceless Skype accounts, remember that your developers are people, hired for their skill, and rely on them. As with any knowledge workers, some of the following problems can lessen overseas developers’ work satisfaction: Find out about how your partner keeps developers on your team for the long term. Most of these motivation killers fall into the category of common-sense management practice, but the last two are controlled by your offsite colleague. As you build a partnership with your developers around effective communication, regular contact, and shared dedication to the project, you want an ally who focuses on their more individual needs. Office atmosphere and fun with coworkers can keep developers cheerful, while optional trainings and learning opportunities can provide mental stimulation. THE BOTTOM LINE Before choosing a provider, do your homework. The simple fact of the matter is that outsourcing significant development work should not be taken lightly. Make sure that your project is appropriate and ready for offshoring, and figure out how you will manage outside workers. Question both managers and developers, get references from current clients, and do whatever you can to confirm your partner’s trustworthiness and dedication to you as a new customer. Outsourcing can help you save money and improve your results, but if you want to be sure to benefit, you will need to put in work managing your team, and you’d better find a great partner to share the load. It may certainly look daunting, but don’t give up, because many companies just like yours have successfully made the switch! June 2013 Edward Moe, Binary Studio", "date": "2020-07-09"},

They start from scratch and end up next day with usable software. That was the third Hackathon in Donetsk and the second hosted and organized by our company. More than 80 programmers from different cities of Ukraine attended the event. All the developers were provided with food, drinks, good coffee and cookies. So they did not have to wary about anything but coding. The majority of participants didn’t sleep a wink all night. Some teams were more relaxed than the others and even found time for PlayStayion, ping pong, foosball or a nap. At 6 in the morning the contestants watched the sunrise listening to the guitar. 24 hours passed really quickly. And at midday all the teams had to present their projects. In total 14 projects were successfully launched during project demonstration. With the help of show of hands vote the participants chose a winner – Binary Studio team with their project 7 bits. The idea was to recreate playing the game consoles, starting browser game emulator Nintendo with the ability to connect two mobile devices that act as a joystick. The application was done on Node.js, socket.io, backbone, Marionette, Grunt and require.js. It’s the second time the team from Binary Studio won the first prize at DOU Hackathon in Donetsk. We are really proud of our young talents. The second place was taken by the team which also developed software connected with games - dimensional team multiplayer space shooter (Node.js, Socket.io, Underscore.js, Impact.js). The creator of PeopleTrack application was the third winner. The software written on Java, OpenCV counts people passing the camera. Check out more pictures at facebook .

Many more interviews with Binary Studio Team Members to follow =) Let's start with a few simple questions: How are you? What have you done today? Well, I’m great, I’ve had a great day, we have a prospect visiting us today, I also worked over the newsletter, disputed things with Kate a bit and helped Polina, well just the ordinary day. Are you often interviewed? Ha-ha-ha, not really 🙂 What’s the project you are currently involved in? Well, marketing! Though it couldn’t be called a project, a great number of projects actually. Today I was dumbfounded by my team who think we should start doing  Google hangouts well a kind of technical webinars, so now I am puzzled with how I give birth to it and what developer could be involved into this. But basically, for now I have 3 tasks – newsletter and two blog posts. Do you remember your first day @ Binary Studio? Yeah, I remember it very well. I was wearing black jeans, gray Uggs and a gray shirt. It was 10th of January, I had a state exam at University, don’t remember exactly which one. So I informed Artem I would only be available in the afternoon, by that time I was working at home during the first week, mostly using skype.  So Artem asked me to call him when I was finished with my exam, so I did. I thought he would ask me to go and pick up some printouts or a banner for our new office, but he said – well, come to Boghdana Khmelnitskogo 40, and we’ll see. This sounded so obscure that I was expecting another consultation, we had a few before, Artem showed me redmine etc. Artem came and I finally had someone to instruct me, I'm not sure if I also met Dima on my first day. It was a long journey to the office; I got the location wrong that day and decided to walk, so I had to walk all the way down from University and it was snowing heavily. When I arrived half wet, I open the door and saw a huuuge room and soo many strange people and Artem was not there, I was scared. I had no clue it was actually my first work day, I thought I would just drop by the office to fulfill some task. Then somebody showed me my table, I was told to install software.  I had no idea how to do that! I’ve never installed anything in my life before that day. So I was sitting there trying not to look panicking installing skype, chrome and some other soft. But I remember I couldn’t figure out for quite a while who he was, he came and left every now and then, but no one introduced us. I was quite puzzled – I was sitting at the front door and wondering who he was and why he was there. The person I got to know the first day was Kurilenko, you could hear him just when you enter the office, he was loud and funny just as he is now. I remember two people started talking to me and showing interest towards me a couple of days later, before that they were just looking at me – office manager, I was at that time. Then Dima came and with the time I was no longer alone on my team. I think I also started understanding developers’ world. Next I loved it. And I think they started liking my care for them. Why did you come to work at Binary Studio? For some strange reason I had a really strong wish to work here. I wasn’t really looking for a job at that time; I was going to interviews for year and a half while working as a teacher at the English school. In the beginning I was looking for a better position, and then I understood I had this fear during the interview, so I decided to attend as many interviews as I could to fight that fear, well a kind of psychological challenge. So I went to interviews every second week for various positions and industries, I didn’t really care, I had this kind of gambling feeling, sometimes I felt it was me who lead the interview (laughing). I fulfilled dozens of test tasks, watched out for different interview methods, I had a gut feeling I‘d better gain some confidence in interviews, because one day I’ll need it for the position I like. I refused all the others. That’s how I came to Binary Studio interview just to exercise 🙂 I liked the Job Opening text also – it was really funny it said the staff was mostly male + a smiley.I was impressed by the fact that I sent my CV and got a call from Artem just ten minutes later.At the interview I was asked some basic ordinary questions, they checked my English, next Artem stood up to explain what I would have to deal with. It was a hard task, but Artem was really inspired and he drew some directions on the white board including office, recruitment, events and help with sales. Before he stood up and started talking I thought he was some programmer or a secretary, because he behaved very simply - took my jacket and showed me the way to the room, asked me to sit down., well I didn’t think he was the business owner. To tell the truth I don’t know why I wanted to work here, I guess Artem made a great sales pitch for the Office Manager position (hahaha).  The salary for the position was two times lower (for the first couple of months) than the one I got at school, and I had to work 3 hours more a day, which is  60 hours a month, so no logics in my choice actually (hahaha). Just gut feeling I like it, I need to work there. Artem had me buy in. What do you consider your accomplishments for these three years at Binary Studio? Well, a good question, really, I forgot I had written that one.  Of course I consider Academy and Cherdak my accomplishments, oh no, skip that I think Kate is my accomplishment (Kate laughs). Not actually mine, but yeah, maybe to some extent. The first thing that came to my mind and the first thought is always the correct one – it’s my personal growth. Some tactics in communication with people, dealing with conflicts, management skills and planning, well all types of organizational processes - yeah I have disciplined myself. So now I teach everybody to discipline themselves and organize everything they do. Name 5 things you like about your job. 1. The color of walls, I chose it myself (smiling). Soo, four more things I like, okay. 2. My boss I respect him a lot; 3. my team they are the best and 4. the fact that I can go and chat to someone and next I can sit at my PC, doing something quietly on my own. Well for me that’s a healthy balance of tasks that require communication and concentration, I think it would have been extremely difficult for me to have to talk and attend meetings all day long or the other way round  -  sit in front of my PC talking to no one all day. Well sometimes I have the days filled with meetings only or lonely PC work, but mostly it’s a healthy balance which I like a lot. And the fifth thing – I repeat it quite often I guess, - I like that fact that I can initiate and my initiatives will be considered, this is crucial for me.  Well now I guess it’s sometimes even the other way round, I start implementing things on my own even before they get approved (laughing) – I’m joking of course.  Recently I came to a conclusion that it’s even more important for me to start things than to improve and scale them up, yeah, I love initiating, giving birth to some projects, starting new things no one has done before -  that’s the most difficult and I like dealing with difficult things. What do you think of when you think of Binary Studio? Terrible question, let’s get rid of it. – No let’s paraphrase it – What do you associate our company with? Well at this point -  our trip to Europe. This was the time I got the feeling of unity, you know - the feeling you get when you walk upfront and people behind your back are your team, your colleagues, your guys 🙂", "date": "2020-07-09"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "5-misconceptions-about-hiring-developers-in-ukraine", "author": ["Binary Studio"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/03/10/5-misconceptions-about-hiring-developers-in-ukraine/", "abstract": "Having heard of all the advantages Ukraine has to offer in terms of highly skilled IT resources, you might want to know some misconceptions that can jeopardize your project. Get info about common misconceptions about the Ukrainian IT community. Starting your project well- Informed will give you an advantage building your team. 1)      Salary≠ motivation IT is a relatively new industry for Ukraine. The boom began in the first decade of 2000, but the pace with which it has continued to evolve really astonishes. Thousands of companies have already worked with Ukrainian developers and gladly return to them again and again. Such demand led not only to high salaries, but also a situation where developers can choose which Ukrainian company they want to work for.  Money is no longer the only deciding factor, since no matter where they go, developers command a respectable rate. Developers have thus gotten used to comfortable work conditions, friendly atmosphere and challenging projects. The more efforts a Ukrainian company makes to keep developers in high spirit, the higher are chances of retention and long-term cooperation. 2) Young ≠ unskilled or inexperienced Lots of talented young people become passionate about programming early at University, attracted by the idea of living in pace with all modern technologies. Programming has meant great career opportunities and work conditions, as well as the possibility to be a part of something significant. Together with golden rule of Ukrainian IT world: “you rock – you work,” the possibilities from a programming career motivate young people to be hard workers, real geeks and great professionals. In outsourcing companies, some of these soon-to-be gurus enjoy the stability and great atmosphere, while others gain experience before trying to create their own framework or form a start up to change the world. But all of them are driven by great desire to learn and work hard. It's very common for developers to start expanding their knowledge early, and to proactively challenge themselves to learn new skills. This means that it is common for younger guys to be extraordinarily productive. 3) Best developer  ≠ 20 years of experience As mentioned earlier, IT in Ukraine is relatively new, although it is rapidly gaining popularity and recognition. That is why effective developers with 15+ years of experience are very rare. The average age of a developer in Ukraine is around 25-26, and it is entirely common to see 22-23 year old guys performing better that experienced middle developers. When you're building a team and thinking about \"senior\" developers, what does your project actually require? Experience with old technology? Skill and knowledge of the best techniques? Leadership ability or confidence? Some of these qualities come from age, some can be helped by age, and some simply come from particular experience. Seek to build a team with the capabilities you need, rather than the resumes you expect. 4) Over qualification ≠ safe choice In Ukraine (and other former Soviet countries), university education in math, physics and informatics remained strong, enabling Ukrainian developers to tackle problems that are technically complicated. Lots of developers long for challenging and complex projects, and when given supporting and bug fixing work they can get demotivated. Less experienced developers may be more appropriate, as the process of learning new technologies may be interesting, even if the project is not. This is very similar to the above point: even if money is not the primary issue, don't expect that a team overqualified superstars is ideal. The most important thing is finding the right match between your project and the ability of your team. A motivated team, enthusiastic about building your project will always outperform a more technically competent team who is less interested. 5) Honesty and conscientiousness ≠rudeness and stubbornness For developers, outsourcing can be interesting because it gives the chance to gain experience and skill while working on varied projects with different technologies. Similarly, within outsourcing development companies, there is often a deep pool of shared knowledge. This means that developers may have knowledge of better or faster ways to handle a project, and may push for something different than you initially intended. In these circumstances the best results come from encouraging a clear exchange of ideas. Obviously, it is the customer or product owner who best knows the business requirements as well as why certain technologies were chosen, and so it's up to them to make the decision. Above all, recognize that a desire to do things better means a desire to improve the product and means developers are thinking, rather than just simply acting. Obviously, when looking for developers you have a lot of options. In all, the best advice is simple: pick a team who is a good match for your project. The best value for your money will come from a dedicated and productive team who finds your project interesting, challenging, and appropriate to their abilities.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "flutter-2", "author": ["Denis Beketsky"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2020/04/17/flutter-2/", "abstract": "Unlike 99% of all articles, when the copy/paste approach is suggested to build an application for multiple environments , in this one I will focus on cases when you have exactly one entry point with an environment specific configuration being generated for your app with one small CLI command. So it will be useful for Flutter developers that don’t have a lot of experience with CI/CD or projects that have multiple environments. For any other Flutter developers, this article will show how the build process can be simplified by the advertising package flutter_config to configure the native layer and environment_config package for the Dart layer, and how flutter_config can be used with environment_config to make things even simpler. When you start developing a new mobile application, you usually don’t have problems with multiple environments and their configuration. But after some time, when it’s time to publish your work to production (especially if it’s a public project), you will face the issue that you need to configure both the production and development environments. Later, when the project starts to grow, quite likely you will need to set up more than that. For instance, in our project, we somehow need to deal with 5 different environments. Usually, frameworks provide different tools and techniques out of the box to answer this question, but it’s not obligatory. So let’s try to figure out what options Flutter has. If you ever were curious about the different techniques of environment configuration in Flutter, you have definitely heard about Flavors. Flavors in Flutter were basically inherited from the Android environment configuration approach. So setting them up is quite straightforward. Specified variables can be used in XML files and in native code. You can easily find the extended configuration in various articles or in Android docs , so I won’t dive deep into that subject. While dealing with Flavors in Android is quite simple, configuring them in iOS is a little bit harder, since iOS doesn’t have such a thing right out of the box. In order to make it work, the Flutter team decided to use Schemes and Configurations. The main pitfall of this approach is that you need to have a number of configurations, which equal the number of environments multiplied by 3 (in the worst case scenario). For instance, if you have test, stage and prod environments, since each env can be built in debug, profile and release modes, you will need to have configurations like: Debug, Release, Profile, Debug-test, Release-test, Profile-test, Debug-stage, Release-state, Profile-test and etc. And then variables from various configurations can be used in plists and native code. And again, if you want to find the extended configuration, you can simply Google it. And here we get to the final part of every Flutter application - Dart code. So let’s tie Flavors and their variables to Dart code. And… wait, what? You can’t do that? Yep, unfortunately, there is no way to directly get access to Flavor variables inside Dart code. Instead, almost every article suggests that you use the next approach: But isn’t it a good approach? Let’s be honest - not quite. We can start with the fact that storing your credentials from all your environments on GitHub or any other VCS is not the best idea. Another pain point of this approach is that you will need to have multiple config files, and changing or adding config variables could become quite problematic, especially if your configuration will start growing. You could ask: so why is this approach for Dart code so bad, and basically the same approach for native code (Flavors) so good? Well, in fact, I’m not particularly excited about the Flavors approach either. But... it’s native code side, so potentially you may need to have different values per platform. We will try to solve this issue too in a few minutes. But before that, let’s focus on Dart code first. So is there anything we can do about this? For sure, yes. We can create a CLI command that will generate a config file and you will have 1 entry point. There could be multiple options for how this can be done, so let’s take a look at other languages first. Let’s take a look at the most common way how JS and PHP solve problems with different environment configurations. Web is quite close to mobile apps, simply because it also runs in a client environment, so we will start from JS. Webpack (JS build tool) has a plugin called “DefinePlugin” that allows you to use env variables within your code during compile time. The idea behind this is quite simple. You are using global env variables in your code. During the build, these variables are replaced with actual values. This allows you to specify a different set of values for a particular environment build. In PHP, on the other hand, we have a package called “composer-parameter-handler”. You can find information about it in the composer - PHP dependency manager. What it does is generate a YAML file based on the provided values from global environment variables, dist file or terminal arguments. So what approach to choose? Well, JS’s approach is quite interesting, but PHP’s is much simpler and solves the exact same issue. So let’s use it and create a code generation script for this. We will start with something simple - collecting data from command arguments. First, create a Dart file with a ”main” function in it. It will be executed by default when we run this file from the terminal. Then, get data from arguments. To do so, we will need a Dart package called args . This package allows you to retrieve entered arguments as HashMap. You can define as many options as you want. Then, simply create your config file with the provided key/values. But what config type is better to choose? First, you can think of something like JSON, YAML or .env formats. All of them are quite simple, but the common issue for them is that all values will be Strings, and also you will need to import this file. Since it’s an Async operation, it means that you won’t be able to start your Flutter app until the config is loaded. You may think, “well, it’s not a big problem overall, I can live with it.” Sure, but why do you need to leave with it if you can easily fix it? To solve all of this, we can simply use a Dart file with a config class in it. And it is actually easy to generate. To do so, we just need a package called code_builder . This package allows you to define the file structure, generate source code and even format it. Just modify the set of fields based on the set of arguments that you are going to receive from command. And DartFormatter will do the rest. It will return the formatted string which can be written in a file like this. And that’s all. You just generated your first config file. Now you can import it anywhere in a project and use data from it. Obviously, you will want to add the generated file to gitignore, which means that you will need to generate it during the build. So the next step, surprise, surprise - is to integrate it into your build tool 🙂 We will use CodeMagic as an example. This tool allows you to specify different variables per workflow: And then you can add your command to be executed in the following way: That’s pretty much all from the Dart side. As I promised earlier, now we will try to figure out something for the native portion of your app to simplify Flavors setup. To fix this, you can simply use a package called flutter_config This package allows you to use values from the “.env” file inside your native code, including gradle config for Android and plist file for iOS. You can find info about setting this thing up in native for Android and iOS , so I won’t spend too much time explaining how to use this package, since the docs are quite descriptive and straightforward. And at this point, you may ask: so what if I need to have the ability to configure native and Dart code? Should I extend the config generator to create a .env file too? Or maybe it’s better to simply use a “.env” file instead of a Dart config class? Well, it’s your choice for sure, both options are fine. And I would say that probably the first variant will be better, simply because you will get benefits from Dart’s typing system, despite it being a bit more complicated. But what if I told you that you can use the first approach in a far more simple way? This package allows you to generate a Dart class and .env file from the same config. It can also generate fields with types other than String, or generate just a Dart class or just a .env file. It also has the ability to define custom Dart code for field values if needed (like a method call to get value and etc). There are a lot of different options, and you can find more info with some examples here . But let’s return to our topic. To use this package, you need to define a config in pubspec.yaml or environment_config.yaml (also you can provide a path to any other YAML file during command run if needed) with any amount of fields. Let’s define what we need to do next: In addition to that, let’s define that, during config generation, each of these fields should try to get value from the global env variables like: Also, we will define some default values per each field. A quick explanation about API_URL default value: as you may know, if you need to make API calls to your local environment, Android and iOS require different URLs. And to use Platform object, you need to import the dart:io package first, that is why config also has an import key specified. Now for your local env, you can simply run flutter pub run environment_config:generate and it will generate the following Dart class for you: And the following .env file: Now you can import the Dart file anywhere in your code, and use the .env file with flutter_config package to pass specified values into your native code. And at the same time - you will have just one command to generate both! If you want to have different values - just run a command with the appropriate key-value pairs like --ENV=prod --API_URL= http://example.com and you will get a configuration with these values. Overall, you can define any arguments based on specified fields in the YAML config. Additional bonus: Since each field has reference to a global var, integration with a build tool like CodeMagic will be as simple as the following: Define Environment variables And then just add command run to the pre-build script section: And that’s pretty much it. Now you can generate your environment specific configuration with just one small command and not expose your credentials anywhere except your build tool. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue in environment_config . Likes and shares are appreciated! 🙂 Thank you for your time and happy coding!", "date": "2020-05-05"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "binary-studio-academy", "author": ["Edward Robe"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2017/07/17/binary-studio-academy/", "abstract": "When is a Junior not a Junior?  When they're from Binary Studio Academy! A common approach to building a well-balanced development team is to have an equal mix of senior, mid and junior experienced developers in the group.  The reasoning is pretty straightforward - juniors are more affordable, they offer fresh insights on old problems, and they have a strong sense of enthusiasm and desire to prove themselves to their team members and clients.  However, it is important to note that not all juniors are created equal!  In fact, although salaries for entry-level developers are fairly consistent on the global market, the quality you can expect from new programmers can vary drastically.  One case in point -  our Binary Studio Academy graduates. Originally, we created Binary Studio Academy to address the issue we were having with finding qualified developers in our home region of Donetsk, Ukraine.  Finding an experienced programmer is actually a pretty straightforward process:  review a candidate’s CV, have a look at their portfolio, and conduct an in-person interview.  But what if they are fresh out of university and don’t have a fleshed out portfolio or previous job experience?  It’s hard to determine whether a person will not only have the technical capabilities, but also the skills necessary to work in a team and meet deadlines.  Binary Studio Academy was our answer to this problem. A coding crucible Founded in 2011, BSA was designed as a free annual intensive course that combined detailed technical instruction with a real-world simulation of working on commercial projects.  Students are assigned to groups based on their technology stack specification - .NET, JS, or PHP development  - and then challenged to build a test product within a set time frame and using modern agile development methodologies under the guidance of our experienced developers.  By the end of the course, students receive a deep understanding of their selected frameworks and have a real product that they can add to their professional portfolio, while we are able to monitor and evaluate them throughout the entire process. This provides a unique opportunity to develop a meaningful connection with our students as they are challenged with a variety of difficulties that natural present themselves in real world development.  We get to see how candidates communicate remotely in teams (as they will most likely be working with clients which are located around the world), and how they handle the stress of meeting a deadline.  We also learn how to react to constructive criticism and adapt to a dynamic work environment.  These are the sort of skills that are very hard to glean from reading a resume, but become quickly obvious when you’re working in the same team with someone. From many, few We have always prided ourselves in being very selective at our company, and the Binary Studio Academy selection process is no different.  Every year, an average of two to three thousand applications are received from students of the top universities across Ukraine.  After a very demanding screening process, we admit around 4% of applicants into the program.  After a brief introduction,  the program begins on the first week of July and lasts for three very intensive months.  At the conclusion of the program, we graduate around fifty to sixty of the original applicants, and from those, we select only a few to be members of our company.  The applicant-to-hire ratio is less than half a percent of the original pool of candidates - demonstrating that we accept only the cream of the crop from each year’s class. A good developer is a well rounded developer While operating Binary Studio Academy for over seven years, we’ve learned a lot about the different calibers of programmers who walk through our doors each year at the start of our summer program.  We’ve had students who hadn’t even finished university finish the BSA program with flying colors and been offered job offers - while other candidates with several years of work experience washed out before the first week of the course!  From this experience we understand why juniors have such a bad rap with clients - they are terrible inconsistent and a big risk for a customer who wants a certain standard of quality and responsibility from all the members of his development team. Another important point is that you cannot judge a developer solely on their ability to write code.  Although we have very high technical standards of employment at Binary, we also make sure that the developers we bring into our crew are good communicators and are capable of interacting directly with our clients.  Many development companies use “face” personnel to interact with clients, which increases overhead and dramatically ups the chances of miscommunication and bottlenecks between the customer and developers.  This is why we insist that even our junior employees have at least an intermediate level of English and are able to directly speak with their client-side team members. Recruitment process on steroids During Academy, we get a very good idea of who is going to be capable of building a quality product as well as be a solid team player for our clients.  On more than one occasion we’ve dropped a candidate who was technically brilliant but awful at working in a group setting, or someone who was just incapable of operating independently without direct and constant supervision.  These sort of drawbacks are show stoppers for clients who don’t have the time nor inclination to babysit their developers on a daily basis, especially when differing time zones are a factor. Forever learning Once Academy finishes at the end of summer, the educational process continues through our Academy Pro program.  This is our internal training system which is taught by the same instructors as in Academy, but directed at our already-existing employees in order to “level up” their abilities.  During Academy Pro, we discuss current trends with technology frameworks that we specialize in and new challenges or innovations relating to each coding language with which we operate. We believe that our employees - junior and senior alike - should constantly be looking to improve their abilities and sharpen their skills in order to stay ahead of the fast-evolving IT sphere.  A developer who isn’t growing is going to become obsolete very quickly, which is why we nurture a culture of “eternal students” that starts in Academy and continues throughout a developer’s career here at Binary Studio. Trained to a higher standard This mentality that we have fostered over the years has proven to be incredibly beneficial for our team, with over half of our current employees being graduates from our Academy program, including our current CTO and many of the senior staff that now conducts the courses offered during our summer program.  As for the juniors which come out of Academy, all of them have proven themselves as being perfectly capable of working in a real world environment, producing commercial-quality code with minimum supervision and management from a client.  It’s also a huge benefit that they are “primed” by the Academy experience and are eager to prove themselves after completing such a rigorous and demanding training course. In the end, we firmly believe that this sets the gold standard from which a junior developer should truly be judged.  We understand that a client who takes a junior onto their projects is assuming a risk, one that we take great efforts in eliminating by only accepting the finest new talent into our ranks and testing them thoroughly before ever placing them on a customer’s project.  This is why we can say with confidence that the programmers that graduate our Academy or more than capable of being a valuable asset to any development team.", "date": "2020-04-21"},

Unfortunately in the world of software development, this logical approach is hampered by the very nature of the business - it is often nigh-impossible to accurately predict how much it will cost to create your app in advance. Outsourcing firms have been struggling with this issue for ages, yet there is no easy answer we can give to clients who want to know the final price tag of a project before they commit their hard-earned cash to it. Why is it so frustratingly difficult to get a fixed estimate on building your app?  This post will briefly address the nuances of contract estimation on why it’s just so darn difficult to nail down a price before signing that contract. 1)  It’s frustratingly difficult to change a contract after its written Let’s say you are very diligent in writing down every feature, functionality, and design that you want implemented in your app - and that your development firm gives you a solid, accurate breakdown of how much time (and therefore, money) each of those components will require to implement.  We certainly appreciate a client who spends a great deal of energy in preparing a plan for what they’d like to build - it certainly makes our job easier! That being said, I have some terrible news for you - if the app is anything more complex than a few weeks of work to build, I can say with near certainty that your plans will change. More on that below. Okay, let’s say your plans change.  What’s so bad about changing a contract? In short - renegotiating a contract is a huge waste of time and resources, not to mention a terrible strain on the relationship with your development provider.  Every new feature must be considered, and both sides need to commit attention to recalculating the new terms of the contract - time better spent actually building the product.  There is almost always a rush for time in these situations, and just when you get everything figured out - something else may go wrong and the whole problem starts from the beginning! This is why nearly all firms push for Time and Materials (T&M) contracts for the development of any project longer than a month or so.  Software development has too many variables to consider and the time wasted on contract negotiation is simply not worth it, for either party. 2) External forces will almost certainly change your app as you build it. “No!” you say, “I carefully calculated every feature, I know exactly what I want!” Sure, but do you know what your customers want?  Once you build an MVP of your product and start getting feedback on your app, you may be surprised about what sort of feature requests you get and what amazing functionality actually turns out to be completely worthless to the vast majority of your customers. What happens if a competitor beats you to the bunch and releases a similar product, and you need to pivot into a different niche?  Or when you decide to push for a faster release in order to meet a deadline for your investors?  Or, heaven forbid, your funding runs out and you need to push the product as-is in order to drum up some cash? All of these factors can drastically change the timeline for releasing your product, and therefore, the conditions of your contract.  Besides… 3) Your own idea for the app will evolve. I know, I know - you said before that you did your research and you know precisely what you want to build - other factors be damned, you are sure you know every feature you’d like to implement! However  - you’re probably in for a surprise.  The thing is that you will be growing along with this app, and you will naturally have new ideas that you want implemented, that you need implemented, which you could never have predicted prior to starting down the long-road of development. 4) A successful app will grow… and grow, and grow! Building a complex business solution is never an open and shut case.  Take a look at every household brand name app on the market and see how many of them have stopped adding features, making fixes, or gone through complete revisions in order to stay on top of their respective spheres. If you were to ask Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb , how much it cost to build the popular shared economy platform, I doubt he could give you a fixed price - because they’re still building it!  At this point, they’ve most likely spent millions of dollars making Airbnb the platform it is today, by employing hundreds of developers in their engineering department, and there is no sign of those costs stopping any time soon - not if they want to keep their market share and stay competitive. I always shake my head when I see firms quote hard prices for building the “next Uber” or “a social network site like Facebook” because they grossly underestimate the commitment required to not only build but maintain and improve on a successful app.  Rarely does a hit app ever truly get to the point where further upgrades and versions are no longer necessary - otherwise they’d stop being used in favor of their competitors! This is why the T&M model is actually far more meaningful and useful to product owners - they can accurately predict their monthly costs and compare them with their anticipated revenue.  That being said, a solid development firm will be happy to give a time estimate in man-days for implementing a given feature, once you decide which features you and your customers want.  However, a development firm can’t predict everything you’re going to want to implement in advance, so it will be impossible for them to state a final price for what you want to build. There is a time and place for fixed price contracts It would be disingenuous of me to say that there aren’t situations where a development firm can and should provide a fixed price to a customer.  Let me briefly go over some possible scenarios: Conclusion It’s a common belief that development firms like the T&M model and fuzzy price estimates because it allows them to exploit a product owner and milk them for all their worth.  However, in the highly competitive world of outsourcing, such firms rarely last long.  As long as you conduct due diligence, you will be able to find a company that can provide you a solid time estimate and deliver constant results which you can track, ensuring that you’re not getting fleeced and are actually receiving a quality product.", "date": "2020-04-21"},

Currently I’m working on a mobile app I created from scratch with Flutter. I tend to be generally conservative and skeptical on new technologies and trends. I’m still in search of the ‘holy grail’ or at least a ‘comfort zone’ cross platform framework. I would like to share my experience with Flutter in this regard. “Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile , web , and desktop from a single codebase.“ - flutter.dev Sounds too good to be true, and of course it is. The only practical use case is creating new mobile apps for iOS and Android. Everything else is ‘ongoing work’ but all the actual work happens on mobile. Note the ‘UI toolkit’ careful disclaimer in the headline. That’s what it’s all about, where it shines, and the only thing you don’t need to worry about (mostly). It of course does allow you to write cross platform code but so do quite a few other similar frameworks, so nothing extraordinary there. React Native and Xamarin are the first that come to mind, but you might have heard about other, less successful frameworks, too. I don’t have much to say about React Native other than I have a prejudice towards JavaScript in that it’s burdened with its historical limitations and Webpack has a steep learning curve (read: you need to grow a beard for months before you can dive into it). Xamarin looked promising at some point but, having worked with it for 18 months, I don’t want to think about going back to it because of the terrible, critical bugs the Xamarin team doesn’t care about or, worse, have no idea how to fix and just choose to quietly sit on them. Some of the most basic, obvious bug reports are left open for years without attention. I don’t have personal experience with Cordova but it seems like it’s going through its twilight period. So how does Flutter fare on this scene? To start with, it’s no pain to get up and running, so the first impression is positive. Then you start experimenting with your first widgets and find decent support on stackoverflow, medium, etc, so you’re never left high and dry with the problems you run into. Oh, and it even hot-reloads - swell! Since it’s a total replacement for ‘trivial’ UI elements, it’s especially great when you don’t feel like using the native UIs at all. When could this happen? If at this point you decide to try Flutter, you most likely will find it rewarding. In fact, most of the time it’s a breeze not only to create new screens but also to both quickly fix and majorly refactor your existing layouts. Unfortunately, in many aspects. First and foremost, everything but the frontend is essentially missing out of the box. Your 3rd party library list will grow everyday, and you can expect to find bugs in most of them. Then come the bugs of Flutter themselves - both at the app-level and IDE-level. Yeah, sure hot-reload is cool - until it just quietly stops working and you’re stuck frustrated about why your app keeps misbehaving until you realize your changes didn’t make it through to the test device. You can find the most unexpected bugs anywhere: What are these black-and-yellow stripes, Flutter? And why is it so hard to get the dropdown right? I remember it being broken on Xamarin too , big dejavu here. But the biggest disappointment was (and is) the Dart standard runtime. Unlike the Flutter itself, we don’t have easy access to its source code. Nonetheless, coming from C# Linq and C++ std, it’s disappointing that its functionality is roughly what you get in web Javascript.  And at some point you start encountering bugs there too. The Dart language itself suffers from a number of unfortunate design choices, mostly nuisances but some which can be error-prone or outright crippling. The cherry on the cake - Flutter is supposed to be a front-end dream but debug builds lag and stutter on every user interaction. I don’t want to know why and I don’t care beyond the fact that it’s a sorry sight. Contributing to Flutter has been a rough ride as well. A couple of my Google Maps plugin pull-requests were merged, but others got ‘prioritized’ and stuck hanging for months. Despite the long list of shortcomings above, I don’t think you should give up on Flutter. The guys behind it have done a great job of making potentially the best mobile frontend tool on the market. Yes, you still need reasonable skills with each native platform you target but this should be of no surprise when it comes to professional software development. While it’s possible for one developer to work on an app from the ground up, I believe separating the Flutter frontend to a separate developer role will achieve maximum efficiency and speed of development. Switching contexts between e.g. UI transition animation and business model bindings requires a set-of-mind reboot.

We should make sure the definition of sufficient quality evolves along with the project. All of us are interested in doing our job the best we can. But in reality, sometimes you can feel that it is challenging to define what is the best possible quality, given time and budget constraints. You've probably seen this diagram - but it's still relevant today: What is quality? There are multiple definitions. In general, it is a level of satisfaction by conformance to expectations, both implicit and explicit, by all stakeholders. By stakeholders, we mean everyone who is affected by the product and project state: your customers, your users, your developers, your suppliers - you name it. The definition of quality should correspond to the project goal and context. It is basic common sense that you won’t approach development and management of a prototype project the same way as you approach a long term or high-risk domain project. And you cannot expect the same level of quality in these two project types. But here is the trick: later, as the project evolves, the project goals may change. The basic test strategy and approach should be updated along with the project evolution. It is a common thing that a lot of changes are introduced during the project development. New requirements are uncovered, both functional (new features) and non-functional (e.g. accessibility, performance or localization requirements). The goal is to have those expectations in mind when developing the test strategy and to share a new vision of quality as it evolves with the team. For instance, if you introduce new accessibility requirements, it’s not enough to just change the code and test the changes once. It is crucial to add accessibility criterion to the definition of done for all upcoming features moving forward. Our suggestion is to have regular scheduled test strategy reviews with key project stakeholders (e.g. once a quarter or once half a year) to make sure the definition of quality and test approach correspond the current project goals. Below, you will find three examples of definitions of quality vs project goals to give you an overview of how the test approach may vary from project to project: Project goals: Understand the value or fitness of the solution. Both time and budget are constraints. Definition of quality: The product should be just good-enough to understand the value of the solution. Possible test approach: Risks: All project members involved should understand unambiguously that this type of project is not of release quality and was not designed for maintainability . Functional and nonfunctional requirements are not applicable for this type of project. Its only goal is to determine the value of the solution. Project goals: Develop a short-term solution for a specific purpose. Usually, time is the main constraint. Definition of quality: The product should meet functional and nonfunctional requirements, such as reliability, performance, etc. (if they are applicable). But maintainability may not be in scope. Possible test approach: Risks : All project members involved should understand unambiguously that this type of project is of release quality , but as time is the main constraint, maintainability was not the focus when designing the product, so it may not respond well to change, and further support and development of such a project might be costly. Project goals: Develop a long-term reliable solution. Usually, the scope is divided into iterations, and cost might become the main constraint. Also, it is expected that the project will undergo a number of changes along the way. Definition of quality: After each iteration, the product should meet functional and nonfunctional requirements. Also, the design, development and test approach should have maintainability and response to change as a priority, right from the start. Possible test approach: The team focus is on continuous development, testing and support, so continuous automation testing is used when possible: Risks : All project members involved should understand that dev support activities, building automated test suites and thorough design take more time, but only in short-term projects. Introducing changes without a continuous feedback mechanism, such as automated regression test suites, unit tests, or CI might result in waste during long-term projects. It is crucial for a project to update the definition of quality and the test approach along with project goals and new requirement discovery. There is a variety of test types and techniques to cover different product expectations, and you should select the ones that suit your project context to make sure all stakeholder expectations are covered at any step in the project lifecycle.", "date": "2019-11-20"},

It brought extreme popularity to the HTTP interface, especially status codes. In fact, before web services gained popularity programmers used to serve ready web pages to the user. It means that HTTP status codes used were 200 for normally served page, 404 for not found page and one code no developer would want to see - 500. Probably that was making creators of HTTP very sad as they’ve prepared a lot of possible codes. You can find the list of them split into categories here . The wide adoption of REST API changed everything. It defines certain codes that should be used along with different CRUD operations. So for example, code 201 is used after the successful creation of a resource, though in other cases of success code 200 is usually used. This made using status codes a bit more complicated as they should be specified explicitly every time an action is performed to a resource. This led to such kind of code in Express apps: One might say that this is a shortcoming of the Express framework and you must use a more sophisticated framework instead. The thought might be natural, but having worked with various turnkey frameworks like Sails, Loopback or Feathers, I would choose Express without doubts. It keeps on proving that simplicity is the most desirable characteristic of software. That’s why I decided to create a module that will handle setting HTTP codes in Express - express-api-response . The module is implementing the express middleware interface, which means that it can be used in HTTP request handling pipeline. The only thing you should do is attach data you want to submit and error if any to the response object and pass control further to EAR. It will send stringified JSON if present along with a suitable HTTP code. Here is the code from the previous example refactored utilizing EAR: After we finish executing our asynchronous code, we call the next function which passes control to apiResponse function declared elsewhere in advance in the code: Here is the table representing HTTP codes which EAR will choose depending on error and data presence: If you want to customize a code sent to a user you may specify it on the res object: Another option that may be applied is res.shouldNotHaveData . If it is truthy, then EAR will not consider absence of data as failure and will respond with success status. Despite the fact that the EAR module is simple in creating, understanding and using, it nicely facilitates the work with web services and I am using it in all my express projects.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "pattern-matching-c-7-0-things-know", "author": ["Kirill Miroshnichenko"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2017/07/20/pattern-matching-c-7-0-things-know/", "abstract": "Every new version of C# language specification brings us something tasty to try, something that makes the developer’s life easier and the code more clean and understandable. In the last few versions, the Microsoft team brings a breath of fresh air into the ability to build conditional logic. In this article, we will go through the new syntax in-depth and see on the real examples of how to use pattern matching and how it actually works. With C# 7.0 we get a new conception of patterns. We can describe them as special language elements that help check values for specific characteristics and extract them. Using C# 7.0 you can use already known language constructions (switch-case and is) in a slightly different way. The patterns themselves can have the form of constants and types. Additionally, when type patterns are used, the checked value can be immediately saved into a variable. Let’s demonstrate all the new stuff with real examples. In the previous version we could write something similar to the next example: Here we check passed obj value against type (type pattern). With the new syntax the same can be done much easier: We can even use a fancy var keyword: Examples above are called Type Pattern and Var Pattern respectively. In addition to casting, you can also compare a variable with a value: But wait, there’s more! We can use this ability even when we don’t know the exact object type: This type of pattern matching is called Const Pattern . New possibilities naturally combine together: Just look at this neat code and imagine what you would have to write without the new syntax. Ok. Now it should be clear. But the interesting thing is what happens inside. Let’s compile and decompile it to understand how it actually looks without the syntax sugar: Everything is quite simple, but it’s ugly… In the example above, in the method DemoCat, we used a reference type. But what happens if we do pattern matching against a value type? A value type cannot be used with the operator ‘as’ and cannot be translated the same way in the background as it was with the reference Cat object. But anyway, the new syntax somehow allows us to do the check, and it looks the same. And what actually happens is the following: The compiler translates the matching expression through the nullable type . Let’s move further. We can see more interesting examples when pattern matching is used in the switch-case construction . In the old version, only constants were allowed near the case and the switch itself supported only enums, strings and base types like int, bool, char, etc. The following example demonstrates different kinds of pattern matching in the switch-case construction and its new features: And traditionally, let’s look at the decompiled version: Honestly, I don’t even want to try to understand what is happening there… With C# 8.0 pattern matching for switch-case construction goes even further. It brings three more features to make your code even more elegant: switch expression, property patterns and tuple patterns. Let’s start with switch expression. Usually, we want to separate responsibilities in our code. So we can rewrite the previous example using next two methods: first, it gets the string by condition and then it prints the string. That’s amazing! Here I don’t use any boilerplate and every line contains only useful code. It allows you to write more declarative code instead of imperative and also omit all type checking and null reference exceptions. So far so good. Now we look at even more powerful comparisons with a property pattern. Let's say we have a set of people, and we want to call them differently based on their first name and last name: You can see that we can track every property within an object. You can go deeper and even track inner objects without any worry about null references - if the compiler doesn’t find a correct case, it just goes to default one. The last thing I want to mention is a tuple pattern . Using this feature you can easily construct and deconstruct tuples right in the switch expression. As you can see, pattern matching and the new syntax related to it help simplify life very much and make the code much cleaner. There are rumors that all this stuff will be even more extended in the next language versions. And now, try new stuff in your projects and may the force be with you!", "date": "2019-10-10"},

It appears to be one of the most convenient options from both the developer and business sides of view - it helps drastically cut development costs by being truly cross-platform and is fun to deal with utilizing the latest web technologies. I have been leading the development of a complex Electron application for over three years and a half now (my teammate covered our lessons of utilizing Electron in this article . We have been able to implement lots of functionality and a big part of it was not just adding more stuff to be rendered but also providing ways for users to interact with the app in various handy ways. One of them was through the console. Well, this might be a tool for your power users. CLI can help automate some tasks so that one would not have to open the app and manually perform them. For example, convert file formats, import data or synchronize state. Having a console interface gives the possibility to integrate your app as one step of a continuous integration process. This can greatly improve the impact your application has on your users’ productivity. Furthermore, CLI is a convenient way to perform batch operations - i.e. perform the same action to an array of files. To open up even more possibilities for your users, you can also tweak your app to support Unix-style pipes, which would allow them to perform transformations on data in a language they already know. JavaScript has achieved an unparalleled position of being a truly universal language. It is executed on all kinds of devices and in all kinds of environments. Console applications are no exception. Node and npm have made it easy for us to develop applications with a console interface and install them into the system. The main pillar of CLI is reading user input. There are plenty of modules helping you do this job and one of the most prominent is yargs . It allows you to declare commands and options your application accepts with a concise configuration. Here’s an example: I’ve written down more tips for creating CLI apps with Node.js in this other article . Feel free to take a look if you are interested. So, essentially, Electron consists of 2 types of processes - main and renderer - and both of them are based on Node.js. Hence, we should be able to call our app through the command-line interface just as we would do with a regular Node.js app. The basic check to learn if your application was called via CLI is as simple as checking the number of arguments passed when calling the application: You may want to add some more conditions due to the way your app works, but it will not get much more sophisticated anyway. Then we should execute the condition on app ready to learn if it is indeed called from terminal: In case we want the app to function in CLI mode, we should just set the BrowserWindow show option to false and window dimensions to 0. After adding these code snippets to your app, you will be able to run the app just like this: However, to run the app correctly on Windows, you should tweak the command to look like this: This will keep your application running within the same session until it explicitly stops the corresponding process. Help Have you ever found yourself staring at the cursor in the command line trying to remember what command you need to enter? It is only fair then to help your users recall the command without needing to leave the terminal window. Take a look at how npm does it while having dozens of commands: You can easily implement a similar help screen with the help of the yargs module we looked at above in the article. Spinner Your app most probably has some long-running operations. Normally, you would remedy it with a spinner. So why don’t you utilize one in a console as well? For example, take a look at this module. Logging In the absence of a graphical UI, the text is the only medium with which you can give feedback to your user. Therefore, you should add elaborate logging. You might also want to introduce log levels as an option in order to have the ability to choose just the right amount of output you want to see from the app: 1: don't log anything 2: log errors only 3: log errors and info 4: log errors and info and show a spinner Debugging Finally, you should help yourself by allowing debug options to be passed. Being built on top of Node and Chromium, Electron supports a rich pool of developer tools available at your disposal to easily debug the app. The most prominent of them is a Visual Studio Code for backend debugging (or any other app implementing Inspector or Debugging Protocol for Node). To plug into your app, debuggers need to pass some CLI options to it. However, if you create your own handler for the command-line interface, their options will not be passed through. One way to achieve this is to simply search for these options in your arguments and, if found, execute the app in the normal mode (not CLI): Now you know how easy it actually is to implement a CLI mode within an Electron app. In my opinion, it is one more testimony to the power of the JavaScript ecosystem.

With asynchronous programming, your logic can be divided into available tasks, which can perform some long-running operations such as downloading a resource from the URL, reading a large file, performing a complex calculation or doing an API call without blocking the execution of your application on UI or service. To make you suffer less, .Net framework provides you simple and easy to use keywords, which are the async and await modifiers to transform your code from synchronous to asynchronous. Even though async/await mechanism allows you to do complicated things easier, it is still quite a difficult subject by itself. The article sheds some light on some features and possible pitfalls that you may encounter writing async methods. 1. Return value Async method signature can have three types of the return value: void, Task, and Task<T>. However, the way you return the value in asynchronous methods is not applicable here. Async methods implicitly create the instance of Task for you, which is used as a return value. You might have noticed that we never return Task directly. Instead, we return nothing (in case of async void and Task method) or an instance of type T (if async Task<T> method). This simplification improves readability by making the asynchronous method look synchronous. In the case of void return type, the instance of Task is still implicitly created, even though it is not returned to the caller. Generally, it is a bad practice to have void async methods, unless they are used as asynchronous event handlers, where returning a value does not make much sense. Also if you want to implement the “fire and forget” strategy and do not care about it when it is finished. The last option is when you have to implement an interface that does not support Tasks. But in this case, you would rather ask the author of the interface to extend it. 2. Exception handling Any thrown exception within a Task is always wrapped in AggregateException object. Therefore, working with Tasks, we usually deal with aggregate exceptions, which sometimes may be inconvenient. Async/await simplifies exception handling to make code look more synchronous. When you await Task that was terminated by the exception, await mechanism implicitly unwraps propagated AggregateException, leaving you with the underlying exception. Dealing with the unwrapped exceptions is easier and better in terms of code readability. Sometimes AggregateException contains more than one exception. In this case, the first exception is taken from the inner exception list during unwrapping. If you want to handle all inner exceptions, you should do it directly through task object. This is the reason why the code below works. If we change TimeoutException with ArgumentException in the catch statement, the thrown exception will be unhandled. When you throw an exception inside async Task or async Task<T> method, it is attached to the task object. However, when you throw it inside the async void method, it cannot be attached to the task, as there is no task. Instead, the exception will be raised on the SynchronizationContext that was active when async void method started. 3. Async method inside Async/Await allows us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, therefore it is easy to labor under the delusion that invocation cost in terms of performance is also similar. Unfortunately, it is far from the truth. Async/await is syntactic sugar, not available at IL/CLR level. For that reason compiler will generate state machine based on the method above, full of much boilerplate code. The more awaits you have inside the method body, the bigger resulting state machine becomes, transforming what seems as several statements into a long chain of conditions and commands. It drastically increases invocation cost of such a method in comparison with synchronous method. Another reason that may decrease performance is object allocations. Async/await causes implicit task object creation, required to be returned to the caller. This leads to one of the largest performance costs in an asynchronous method, which is calling a Garbage Collector. If such asynchronous method is frequently invoked it will result in a large number of created task objects needed to be garbage collected. You can fix it by caching tasks and invoking the async method only when the cache does not have an appropriate task. 4. Context capturing Async methods implicitly captures current synchronization context. Then, the context is used to execute the async method code after awaiting is finished. It means that the code before and after “await” statement will be executed on a thread owning captured context. When does it prove useful? For example, in UI and ASP.NET applications, where you can modify or access objects only on the thread, that has created them. Without synchronization context, async method code will be executed using thread pool context on any currently available thread. (Fortunately, AspNetSynchronizationContext was removed in ASP.NET Core. In addition, the async/await mechanism is highly optimized for the contextless scenario. There is simply less work to do for asynchronous requests. For more information you can read this comprehensive article by Stephen Cleary). Here is an example of some WPF element event handler: Here, we start running the method on a UI thread. After encountering await statement we return to the caller. The code following await statement would be executed after awaiting is finished. Thanks to the captured context it will be done on UI thread. If it were not for capturing context we would end up updating textbox object from a non-UI thread, that would lead us to an exception. However, there are many cases when we do not need to switch contexts and execute code on a specific thread. Not only may it be unnecessary, but it also causes a performance loss. In this case, we can setup how we want to await an asynchronous operation using ConfigureAwait method. The code above uses ConfigureAwait(false) to prevent context capturing, therefore after awaiting remaining code is executed on any available thread from the thread pool. 5. Awaiting different types You might have noticed, in the previous example, we await an object that is not of Task type. It is because an object can be awaited if it implements the awaitable/awaiter pattern. This pattern expects from type: 1. Have a GetAwaiter() method, which returns the awaiter object 2. Returning awaiter must implement INotifyCompletion or ICriticalNotifyCompletion interface, have IsCompleted Boolean property and GetResult() method, which returns void, or a result. For example, we can create asynchronous lazy initializer class: As you can see, there are no dedicated interfaces or abstractions for awaitable/awaiter pattern in .NET. This allows us to implement GetAwaiter() method as an extension for existent types, making them awaitable. Now we can await action delegate like we do this with tasks. These are not all possible traps you can face working with Tasks. But keeping in mind all complexities around this fancy async/await mode, you will be ready to solve advanced issues such as deadlocks or race conditions.", "date": "2019-10-03"},

Controlling this beast may take lots of effort and pain. .NET Framework 4 introduces a convenient approach for cancellation of asynchronous operations. How do we control Why should we control the execution flow of the tasks? One reason is business logic or algorithm requirements. Another reason comes from an idea, that there should be no unobserved tasks. Such tasks may hold thread pool and CPU resources and therefore be dangerous. Last but not least is the ability to differentiate being canceled by manually thrown exception or failing by any other exception. Just for this .NET provides us with two classes: How do we pass token Firstly, we should somehow make a task use created token. One way is to pass it as an argument to the method responsible for creating the task. With such an approach, the token is only checked at the very beginning, before starting the execution of lambda expression. If token canceled then the task is also put in canceled mode. In the example above message won’t be printed because token had been canceled before the task was created. But what if we want to stop task execution in a particular moment? Then you should observe the cancellation token state manually inside the task delegate. There are generally two ways for passing token inside task delegate. The first way is to make the token variable visible by task delegate. It can be accomplished by using class field, property or even capturing variable within a method. The second way is to pass the token as state object and downcast it inside task delegate. How do we observe token Now when we know how to access token inside a task, it is time to become acquainted with how we can observe token state. You can observe it in three ways: by polling, using callback registration and via wait handle. 1. By polling – periodically check IsCancellationRequested property 2. Callback registration – provide a callback that would be executed right after cancellation is requested 3. Waiting for the wait handle provided by CancellationToken You can also observe multiple tokens simultaneously, by creating a linked token source that can join multiple tokens into one How do we cancel We already know how to pass and observe tokens. What is left is how we send the cancellation request. For canceling, we use CancellationTokenSource object. Cancellation request may be direct or deferred. When we use the Cancel method directly, it implicitly calls all registered callbacks on the current thread. If callbacks throw exceptions, they are wrapped in AggregateException object that will be propagated then to the caller. Since callbacks are called one by one, optional boolean argument for Cancel method lets you specify behavior upon encountering an exception in any of the registered callbacks. If the argument is true then the exception will immediately propagate out of the call to Cancel, preventing the remaining callbacks from executing. If the argument is false, all registered callbacks will be executed with all thrown exceptions wrapped into the AggregateException . After detecting cancellation request inside a task, common approach is to do some cleanup and throw OperationCanceledException object, to put the task in a canceled state. Conclusion The task cancellation mechanism is an easy and useful tool for controlling task execution flow. It is a part of big .NET Framework ecosystem, therefore its usage in most cases is more preferable than some custom solutions. Even if you don’t want to implement your own cancellation logic you still have to pass CancellationToken to all async methods that support cancellation (i.e HttpClient.GetAsync() or DbSet.FindAsync()).", "date": "2019-10-03"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "functional-programming-csharp", "author": ["Maxim Goncharuk"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2017/12/13/functional-programming-csharp/", "abstract": "Why functional programming? It’s not a secret that Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a dominating paradigm and a lot of best practices are built around the interaction between objects. But for the last few years, Functional Programming (FP) has been becoming more and more popular among developers. FP was originally invented in mathematical circles in languages like Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang. Soon this style began to interest a wide mass of developers because of its brevity and elegance. But it was hard to understand all the charm of the functional approach 30 years ago - immutability and a huge amount of small functions largely affected computer performance. Nowadays it’s no longer a problem. Speaking of .NET, you can see that a lot of useful features come to C# from F#: LINQ, query expressions, async flow, higher order functions, pattern matching, etc. (by the way, here is a good article about pattern matching in C# 7 ). Why are they so useful? Because they help us focus on business logic instead of thinking about core infrastructure, state changes, concurrency and parallelism issues. Moreover, in the near future, the physics of the hardware architecture won’t allow increasing processor speed, so concurrent processing will be the common way to add performance. However, OOP techniques cannot take advantage of multiple processors at once because of shared data and mutable state. Using functional programming, the computer can run several functions at once because those functions are not altering outside state information. Probably for these reasons, the creators of C# provide us more and more opportunities to do it. Using the functional programming way allows us to: As you may know, the .NET community treats the functional paradigm with caution. Perhaps that's why we do not have a fully-fledged functional backend framework yet. And I do not insist that you rewrite your project using a huge set of functions. Rather, I recommend using as many functional features as possible within an OOP framework, such as ASP.NET MVC. In this article, I’m going to show you several approaches that, in my opinion, can make your life much easier. Some of them you may find contentious and not applicable, but I hope you will treat them with understanding and will derive the maximum benefit from reading about them. The State Problem I think many of you will agree that one of the most serious obstacles in enterprise development is managing the state of a part or the whole application correctly. Each developer who works with a multithreading system has spent enough time looking for an error when one thread changes a state while the second thread tries to read the result. This is a common issue in concurrent and parallel programming. But in general, you may find state issues in different places. For example, the next class has a huge set of dependencies and each method uses only one of them: So if you want to get a list of users, you should initialize tons of objects which you won’t use. Moreover, the garbage collector will gather all these objects and freeze the whole server. Another problem you may face is when you use some sort of Builder or State patterns and change their content in different places. In this example, the order of method calls is important and you have to control which function goes first and which is next. In the worst case, the builder’s state could be changed in several different methods and you will spent a lot of time debugging to find the method that caused an error. The easiest way to decrease the count of methods which interacts with a state is to use pure functions. In the next section, I’m going to rewrite examples above in a stateless way. Make your server stateless “Pure function” is a function that doesn’t change any values from arguments. It returns the same result every time you call it with the same set of arguments. The term “pure functional” came from impure functional programming languages, the foremost among them being Lisp. Lisp's design was based fundamentally on functional programming. However, it also allowed side-effects as a pragmatic choice. So, in Lisp, one mostly wrote \"pure functions”, but occasionally, one wrote \"impure functions,\" i.e., functions with side-effects, to get something done. The terms \"pure Lisp\" or \"purely functional subset of Lisp\" have been in use for a long time. Slowly, by osmosis, this idea of \"purity\" has come to invade all of our space. In C#, every method could be a “pure function”, but I suggest using static methods to prevent using the state of the class. Let’s rewrite the first example with static methods: Suppose we don’t have any other methods. Then we can go further and make the whole class static: To get the most benefit, I suggest using as many static methods as possible. Also, if your class is like a service and doesn’t have any fields or properties, you should mark it as a static class. In the OOP world, it is generally accepted that using static methods is an anti-pattern. You can find a lot of arguments about this, but I like the idea from this post at stackoverflow that if you use static methods without touching global or shared data then you can avoid a lot of issues. There are two important things you should remember using static methods: Static methods are very good for testing because you don’t have to care about any state issues or dependencies. You just put several arguments into the function and it returns the same result every time you call it. But as your application grows, sooner or later you’ll need some dependencies (databases, remote API’s, etc). The easiest way to test your code with dependencies is to split the method into two parts: a business logic and a dependency’s initialization. Let’s look at the following simple example on how to test calculations using a database: In the example above, you can see that I split the initialization of the repository and some calculations. Then I use a wrapper for mocking the repository to get a fake company and test calculations. The use of static methods leads us to use functions as the main tool. For that purpose, C# has the powerful classes Func and Action and an incredible set of extensions - LINQ. The next section is all about them. From loop to chain As you already know, in order to represent a collection of data in C#, we have arrays, and the main tool for array processing is a loop. However, there are often many problems when using loops. First, in a loop, you get access to the array by an index and you should guess if your array has this index. Then you have to manually increase or decrease the index polluting the codebase with noise  which isn’t related to the business logic. Finally, every loop has a state - the current index and all your logic relies on it. That’s why I haven’t used loops for a long time. C# has a much more convenient way to iterate a collection - the foreach statement. In this case, we don’t have indices and a state. Every iteration returns us a fresh item, so we can focus more on the business logic. Foreach is the best tool for processing every item in a collection. Nevertheless, if you have filtering, checking, grouping or other complex calculations on the item, you will mess up the foreach statement body. Here, the more elegant solution would be to use LINQ. So instead of creating a huge set of method calls in the loop body, I suggest splitting all of your business logic into a set of small independent functions which transform the collection item on each step through the pipeline. The Null Problem As you probably are well aware, NullReferenceException is one of the most annoying errors that can crash your app. Tony Hoare, a scientist who developed the sorting algorithm quicksort, called null reference his billion-dollar mistake when he added this feature to the Algol programming language. In my opinion, using null reference should be manually defined like it has been done in F# and Kotlin. But while we are waiting for a new version of the language, we should implement all those checks by our own. You can stumble across null references in the following places: There are several practices to check a method’s arguments for null. For example, using Code Contracts , ThrowIfNull or writing your own set of helpers and extensions. To avoid null references in method results, you can either control yourself to not return null anywhere in your code or, what is even better, use Code Contracts or ThrowIfNull on the other layer of method calls. As you may have understood, this does not solve the problem, but only adds more unnecessary code. To eliminate nulls from your logic you have to go to a different level of abstraction. On this layer you can manually check and manage all specific cases, and handle all errors which could happen. In the next section, I will try to introduce you to such a pattern using a monad and several of its variations. Monads to the Rescue As I mentioned above, a monad encapsulates the values of a particular data type and creates a new type associated with a specific additional computation, typically to handle special cases of the type. A monad may have a default value for specific cases and two methods: Monads are very popular in pure functional languages, but in C# we often use them even without realizing it. Let’s start from the most known monad in C# - List monad. In .NET, the List monad is represented as IEnumerable<T> - the core of LINQ. Every LINQ extension is a variation of the return method which somehow transforms the previous state and returns the monad which could be transformed again. To wrap the collection into the monad you can use AsEnumerable() method, or you can also define your own: Then you can call them as a simple chain: Working with IEnumerable, you don’t worry about null items or the length of the collection - you just know that every item in the collection will be transformed by your lambda function and in the worst case you’ll have an empty list. The next monad I want to describe is the Maybe monad. This monad helps you check any reference for null in a more convenient way then I described above. Let’s first look at the example: As you can see, both of these methods just check the input for null. The first function works on the level of abstraction and you can’t just get the value (it could be null) whereas the second function checks the input and if it’s null, returns a default value. Since C# 6.0, we have a language feature which works in exactly the same way: While developing your code, you may need a few more extensions: And this example is quite straightforward: The last monad I want to describe is the Try monad. TryXXX is a common pattern in .NET. When you want to parse or convert something, you write a construction like so: Try monad has similar but more generic behavior. It keeps the value or thrown Exception and you can safely get the result without any runtime errors. Try has a bulky construction but I hope it’s easy to understand: Extension Try just wraps the method call into a safe invocation. We can use TryResult without it, but in this situationwe should take care of exceptions ourselves. This could be useful if you want to handle various exceptions differently, rather than just packing them into TryResult. This example is also very straightforward and doesn’t need any explanations: Conclusion Now I would like to sum up all of the above. Functional programming is increasingly being introduced into real world applications. Nowadays, such technologies like IoT, serverless sites and other cloud based solutions push us to focus on the business logic rather than the code infrastructure. In this case, functional programming may be a more appropriate choice. There is no full-fledged functional framework in .NET yet which allows you to write complete applications in a functional style. However, we can take advantage of both OOP and FP approaches and apply them side by side. I’m sure someone will come up with a new improved paradigm later, but for now let’s get the best from what we have.", "date": "2019-10-02"},

It is hard to recall how the world managed to survive without all this stuff about 15 years ago? Ok, let us examine facts and latest trends. The mobile market is viewed by experts all over the world as the fastest growing part of the world IT sector. Microsoft researchers have reported about 1,08 billion of smartphones in use worldwide in the first half of the last year, while Gartner says about 468 million of smartphones sold by that time and predicts 631 million to be sold by 2015. These numbers may seem not so big, but actually mobile users really mature: Microsoft forecasts mobile internet access to overgrow the PC access by 2014. Of course, mobile devices are not going to replace common computers fully. Nevertheless they have found their specific niche. Why do people use pocket devices? Putting aside games and cellular networks, mobile devices are perfect for small but urgent things online. You won’t expect a person using his or her iPhone for work with big files or massive data load, but this device is quite convenient for checking your mail while travelling to your office in the morning or for uploading to your Facebook account a picture you’ve just taken while having lunch in a pub. So the swift access to some pages online in order to view or make some updates without being bound to any specific place or network – that is the main reason why mobility is so important. Naturally, the fast growing market is in the high need for lower labour prices. That’s why mobile app development projects are widely outsourced. This sector of development due to its innovative nature requires high level of tech skills and creativity. Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, is now an active player in the mobile OSs development market. Following the world trend, Ukraine now boasts a numerous army of programmers mastering Android, Symbian and iOS. The usage of mobile devices for networking is much higher in Western Europe and USA, that’s why Ukrainian mobile applications software development branch is oriented primarily at western markets. On the other hand, the quickly growing demand for skilled mobile app developers makes western project owners interested in finding offshore (or even better, nearshore) contributors which propose significantly lower charges for their work while providing good product quality and fast performance. Android solutions are perhaps among the most widespread projects outsourced to Ukraine, as well as to other Eastern European countries. No wonder, given that Android’s share of the world mobile OS market was 38,5% in 2011 and is going to reach about 48% by 2015 (according to Gartner). In Donetsk, the demand for Android professionals is extremely high today giving the city a good place to look for experienced outsourcer companies for your Android project. Binary Studio has big experience in Android development, having successfully participated in a number of mobile applications software development projects. We are always eager to exchange ideas about the Android market today and tomorrow. Is this interesting for you too? Feel free to contact us right now!", "date": "2019-09-26"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "software-outsourcing-guide", "author": ["Edward Robe"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2018/07/17/software-outsourcing-guide/", "abstract": "Outsourcing software development can be a very confusing affair for the uninitiated.  D ozens of clients have come to us with misconceptions and botched projects that needed serious fixing, so we decided to make a quick outsourcing guide which details some of the points to keep in mind when engaging an outsourcing company for your development needs. Do your research Going shopping before you know what to buy is a great way to end up with junk.  It is important to have a sort of baseline checklist that should be covered before you even begin the search: Follow these guidelines and it will ensure a solid start in whatever development project you have in mind.  Reaching out to firms prior to having this information ready will just result in them asking you for it anyway, or worse, promising you that it’ll be handled “later” after a contract is signed (and it’s too late to back out!). Keep the NDA’s simple and to the point It’s not necessary to impose draconian NDA’s on people just to discuss a potential partnership.  Product owners are always worried that someone is going to steal their million-dollar idea, and are wary of engaging any third party companies without first ensuring that they are covered with a ironclad NDA.  However, NDA’s are a two-way street, and we’ve turned away potential customers in the past due to incredibly oppressive legal clauses present in these agreements. An NDA is essentially a legal risk that the outsourcing company is taking entirely on themselves by signing in the hopes to build trust with a potential client.  Although many clients fear that their ideas and code are in danger of being stolen by a nefarious outsourcing firm, the fact is that most normal development companies have no interest in stealing your business. Software development firms focus on software development - that’s it.  They aren't interested in the business domain, marketing, or even product design, at least in terms with reading what customers want and appealing to their desires - that’s up to the product owner (i.e. the customer - you!)  So you should not need a draconian NDA with extreme fines and nebulous legal wording to protect you from every possible angle. If anything, such an NDA will scare away legit dev companies, because they won’t want to deal with the hassle. An NDA should be straight and to the point - don’t share code, don’t share proprietary data, and a duration of two years after the termination of the contract.  That’s really all you need. Plan on being very involved in the process There is a large degree of participation on the side of the individual or business employing a development firm to build a project.  Building sophisticated platforms is rarely a “turn-key” affair.  Even the simplest apps require a great deal of business logic understanding to do properly , which the product owner will have a far better grasp of compared to the engineers, at least initially.  Good software development requires constant feedback from end users and the product owner. Time and again we’ve seen product owners who take a hands-off approach to developing a platform, passing it off to a third party development firm which assures the product will be built to spec despite knowing very little of the business sphere and true desires of the product owner.  This leads to miscommunication, wasted resources, and substandard products that miss their target audience. The key lesson here is this - developing an app is a big commitment, both from the engineers and the product owners themselves. One should be prepared to spend a fair amount of time working directly with your developers to make sure the product turns out the way you envision it.  This can be done through a variety of ways - creating a set of technical documents/requirements prior to engaging a software firm, participating in regular standup meetings during the development process, and getting acquainted with the technology-side of development to help better understand the engineer’s point of view. In short - the more you invest in the process, the less time you’ll waste and the more true to design the product will become! Prepare for the long haul Many would-be startup dreamers have a picture in their mind as to what the ideal development cycle should look like - a few months of intense expenditures on development to release the product, then a “maintenance cost” to keep the app running while the owner reaps an ever growing amount of revenue for their completed app. This is, to put it bluntly, a pipe dream.  Successful apps - and businesses in general - are always improved and developed, otherwise it would be too easy for a competitor to create a newer, more optimized version of the same platform and claim a larger part of the market share.  Ask yourself - what major modern day app is truly “finished,” making money, but no longer in development? Even industry giants like Facebook, Uber, and other household-name apps are in a constant state of evolution. In reality, the monthly development costs do not suddenly decrease after a product is “finished.”  As your app grows in popularity, competitors will inevitably appear, and you’ll need to keep on top of the latest features to meet the needs of your constantly growing (and demanding) customer base. Therefore, it’s important to understand this facet of software development right from the start.  A good app requires constant maintenance, improvement, and development to stay competitive.  It is not like building a house, where there is a high initial cost and then light maintenance from there on out - it is more like building a farm, which needs to be nurtured and cared for regularly in order to produce a good yield (of satisfied, repeat customers, in this case!) Keep it agile, and favor flexibility with your engagements Unless you are able to predict with an extremely high degree of certainty what exactly your project’s requirements will be, then you should stay away from fixed price engagements. Often we will receive inquiries from startups or established businesses that are building a new product, but who will insist on a fixed price contract model.  This is a recipe for disaster for a variety of reasons which I covered in this article , but the main reason is this: Every time project requirements change (and they usually do), you’ll need to renegotiate the contract, which uses a ton of time and resources - both yours and the devs. The major reason why product owners dislike this approach is its potential for abuse by the developers.  Much like a scrupulous taxi driver who takes unnecessary detours to increase your fare, product owners worry that a developer working on a T&M contract is likely to stretch out the project as long as possible, and drain the product owner’s bank account in the process.  However, with any good development firm, this concern is completely unwarranted. Here is why: As mentioned previously - staying constantly engaged and in good communication with the engineers will provide more than enough assurance that development is going the right direction. Own your code:  Code repositories and how they work You should always be in control of your code, regardless of your personal technical expertise. One of the biggest red flags we see when engaging a new customer is when they come to us with a half-complete project built by another firm… but they don’t have ownership of their own code.  Now what does that mean and why does it happen? Often when a non-technical product owner engages a developer to build them an app, what they receive (and see) is the finished product - the total sum of all that code which the product is composed of.  However, in many situations, the owner is not in control of the code that makes his or her product - essentially, they are getting a picture of the house they paid for, instead of the actual house. This is all well and good (to continue with the metaphor) if the house is in great shape, and you plan on selling/renting it out to others.  But what happens if you’re not satisfied with it? Can you go in and change things yourself? Or hire someone else to replace the previous builders? Not without the original source code, you can’t! Essentially, your code is held hostage by the people who wrote it.  If you don’t like the result, there’s not much you can do besides begging and pleading the original developers to change it.  Not a good situation to be in! Any development firm worth its salt will provide complete access for the source code to the product owner at all times, regardless of whether that product owner intends to dig around in it themselves.  It should be a natural part of your contract with a developer to have ownership, so that in case things go sour, you still have control over what was written (and paid for), and can show it to a third party for review. Conclusion If you were to summarize all these points into a single sentence, it would essentially be, “conduct due diligence - and be involved.”  Engaging a development firm for a project is a real commitment which will inevitably cost several thousand dollars to see through. Therefore, it’s worth doing the research beforehand and asking questions before signing a contract and getting in deep with the development process. We hope this outsourcing guide provides some insight on how to get started off on the right foot.  When in doubt, just remember - ask questions, do research, and pick your partners carefully - the future success of your platform depends on it!", "date": "2018-07-18"},

You’re maybe wondering why you would need such an old framework in 2017. There are several other new frameworks which have many more benefits compared to Angular 1.x. They were developed using modern concepts, and also have good documentation and vast community support. So if you want to start a new project, Angular 4, React or Vue.js would probably be the best choice. But there is a huge number of projects (mostly enterprise) which already exist and can’t be rewritten every time a new published framework or library appears. Todd Motto has fully described this topic in his blog post h e r e. So who should read this article then? It would be useful for you if you: Why is Angular 1.x not so good? Nowadays, the Angular community has come up with many great ideas on how to make web applications fast and reliable built upon clean architecture. Most of them were inspired by functional programming, utilizing composition, immutability, reactive programming, components, and etc. But a few years ago the situation was completely different. You had more breathing room for improvisation and could shoot yourself in the foot at every step. But with Angular, you could write every unit of the application (controller, service, provider or even config) as a function with a list of dependencies. For small applications like ‘Hello World!’ it’s very elegant and graceful. But as the application grows, the codebase becomes increasingly messy. For instance, one $scope object would keep all the data in the application. Or, you would have a lot of business logic in the html page. Or, your minified bundle wouldn’t work after implicit injection. You would be lucky if you could find and fix a small bug hidden behind the mountain of $scope, $rootScope, $timeout, $watch, $apply and other cool features which Angular provides you.  To overcome all these difficulties, you have to follow certain rules and standards. I'd like to suggest you some of them below. Why use component-based architecture These days, you can hear about components from all over the place. React, Angular 4, Vue. All of them implement this model because it is quite useful to split your page into several small parts. But this idea has existed for a long time. ASP.NET WebForms, WinForms and WPF use User Controls, Android and Xamarin use Fragments, IOS uses View Controllers, Java uses Swing Components, and etc. Angular 1.x carried that further by using directives. Most developers prefer to use them just as extended html tags with certain logic. Reusable components from libraries like Bootstrap, Semantic, Material Design - datepickers, tabs, calendars - are good examples of this use case. But why not  utilize all the possibilities which directives provide you? Consider the following: These directives encapsulate some part of the application and can be reused anywhere on the page. Furthermore, they isolate logic and you don't have to worry about their implementation (it could be hundreds of lines of code). On this level of abstraction, you can manage bigger chunks of the application rather than html tags. The next question is:  how can you split a page into several parts? How to split the whole page into directives I can suggest two ways - by model entities and by parts of your page. You can break up your page into parts: navigation bar, breadcrumbs, main content, and details. Or you can distinguish by domain model: products/product, customers/customer, accounts, sales, and etc. Eventually, you can mix both options together, but first you should select a main strategy. Each part should contain some inner behaviour and points of interaction with the rest of the application. These parts are independent and interact with each other through their interfaces. It’s like Legos. You just connect bricks the way you want and it works. Moving forward, you will be able to substitute some parts without affecting others. Moreover, you will fix bugs faster because you're almost positive where to look for them. All you need to do is describe a clear interface for the component. Pros of component-based architecture From the paragraph above you may conclude that using component-based architecture makes it easy to maintain an application as well as scale components and remove components. If you see that your component is growing, you can simply split it into several parts. Or if you see that some component is actually related to another one, you can combine them. You will do all these manipulations without affecting the component’s neighbors because all of them communicate with each other only through an interface. If you’re familiar with functional programming, you know how easy is it to manipulate small functions and replace or scale them. If not, I recommend you read these series of posts about FP in JavaScript from Eric Elliott. Cons of component-based architecture Of course, this approach has its disadvantages. First, developing components takes big effort. You have to think twice about a component's interface - what data it needs and which methods it calls. Also it takes time to wrap each part of the application behavior in a component. Sometimes you also have to adapt parents or siblings to use a new component. Finally, you can end up with tens or even hundreds of components which you should know and be able to navigate between. Therefore, try to find some kind of trade-off. Don’t wrap every html tag, take care of the component’s structure and look at the best practices from the community. Now let’s look at several code smells and how to deal with them. Create separate scope for each directive Dan Abramov, author of Redux, React core team member, described two kinds of components : Stateful and Pure. I recommend you read the whole article, but in short the idea is that a stateful component knows about other components around it (parent and children) and a pure component interacts with others through its own interface. I prefer to have as many pure components as possible. This approach allows you to: Let’s get back to the example we had above: It doesn’t matter where you put this component; it only requires a user as a parameter. To create an isolated scope in Angular 1.x.x, all you need is to create a scope object in your directive function: I don’t want to stop on details about scope binding. What is more important is the strict interface which separates this component from the rest of the application. If you have a chance to use Angular 1.5.x, it would be better to choose a new function component instead of a directive. It has several built-in features that allow you to write a more structured and isolated component: If you’re already working on a big project, you don’t need to rewrite the whole codebase. You can separate each component step by step without breaking other parts. If you have a lot of relationships between elements of your application, you can start from the big ones. For example, separate navigation bar from content, then separate list of items from details, and so on. Extract the directive’s interface In the previous paragraph, I mentioned strict interface. So what is it? Strict interface is all the dependencies of your component. If you decide to isolate a scope in the directive, you’ll quickly find a problem - tight coupling between parent and child components. That’s what we need: every object or field which comes from a parent we can put into a scope. The same applies to methods - you probably use a lot of parent’s methods in your component so you have to decide to either get rid off them or put them into the scope. I strongly recommend the second option. It will be ok even if your directive has ten attributes. In this case, you don’t break an application and don’t lose important logic. At worst, you can always remove useless properties. Then you need to decide which properties will be set up only once and which will change periodically. For those which change from time to time, you have to create watchers. You’ll find more details about watchers below, but in short, you should avoid using $watch at all costs. Use a controller instead of a link After creating a wrapper, you need to put the code for your component somewhere. There are two options: a link function or a controller. If you choose the link function, you will probably have trouble with the order of rendering of your parent and children components. I recommend you use a controller instead of a link because: Let’s write some code: Notice that I put a new object with a user as a property into the onSave method. And don’t forget to set bindToController to true - otherwise your scope won’t be connected to vm. Now the directive is isolated from the whole application and you can change it inside a controller as you want and not be afraid of breaking anything. This freedom, however, allows you to litter the controller very quickly. Hence, the next section is all about messes in your component. Avoid $scope After you isolated your scope, you’re one step closer to clearing your component. But it’s not enough.  The next step is to keep the controller clean inside the component. The most common mistake is using the $scope object everywhere. It’s quite easy to add every model and method to the $scope and then use it on the view. So why is it bad? There are two reasons: You don’t know if the name comes from user-details or from user-list. Moreover, you can accidentally override the existing property. It would be better to have an alias for each component: Now you are 100% sure which scope you are using. All you need is to use controllerAs when you bind your controller to the view. It could be in the template or in $routerConfig (ui-router also supports this technique). Avoid $watch Every time you use $watch you lose control of the property. You rely on the digest loop. But you don’t really know when the digest loop calls your callback. Also, it’s quite easy to create a circular dependency from one property to another when you create an infinite loop between two watchers. Finally, it’s hard to test a controller which has a lot of watch methods. I suggest you use $watch only for arguments of your directive. For example: In this case, if you need to change the layout inside the directive when currentUser is changed you have to use $watch. Otherwise try to avoid $watch entirely. Avoid $event Another option to track when a property is changed is to send an event. Using events is also a bad practice. When you subscribe to an event, you create a tight coupling between components, so they can’t live separately anymore. Also, it’s hard to test a controller which relies on events. Finally, you lose control of the application flow again. So avoid local events if you want to learn if some property is changed. But you can use global events which broadcast to your whole application when something happens. For example, when a user is logged in/logged out, a company changed or an order is accepted. Global events help you avoid throwing some properties through components to notify their children. All three of these rules support Pure components. They are clean, scalable, and self-sufficient. With Pure components, you can build your application from small parts combined in a big solution. On the other hand, you need to somehow manage the data for components. Which we’ll talk about in the next section dedicated to services. Extract the service’s interface It’s a good practice to keep all logic not related to UI in services. Once written and tested, a service can be used in any controller you wish. Also, when you test your controller, it’s easy to replace a service with a mock so you don’t need to send http requests or go to storage in your test cases. If you move your business logic to a service, you’ll quickly find that it would be hard to navigate through tons of methods which may consist of hundreds of rows. Also, it would be difficult to add or remove some of them. So there is one simple rule to make your service easier for future changes - separate the function declaration from function implementation. Let’s look at this example: There are two important things you have to notice. First, the function declaration is seperated from implementation. It helps you see what the service does and the browser will help you if you forget to write an implementation for the method. Second, declare an object with methods at the top of the service function. Later, it’ll be much easier to navigate when you open the file and see all the functions in one place. Use promises instead of callbacks Oftentimes you send HTTP requests from services. There are a lot of examples where people put a callback in the service method and then call it in the $http service: I think that’s because promises were a third-party feature before and people didn’t want to get one more library and dig into it. At the moment, promises are a native feature in most modern browsers, so I strongly recommend you use promise-based flow instead of callback hell. It reduces your code and makes it clearer at the same time: Use promise flow everywhere Not only can http requests be asynchronous. If you have a long-run operation, you’ll probably wrap it into a timeout. If you have some old jQuery stuff, you’ll probably use callbacks. Or you could have some old code which was written using XHR before Angular was presented but you don’t want to change it now. In this case, you could have callbacks or even event handlers. All these kinds of operations create a mess in your services. It would be much better if all of your asynchronous methods returned promises so you could handle them in the same way. For this purpose, Angular 1.x.x has the service $q which can wrap your old methods in promised-based ones. Consider the next example: Although this technique is quite useful, you shouldn’t use it everywhere you have deferred operations. There is a good article on how not to use $q.defer. Despite all the negative feedback, Angular 1.x.x proved itself as a powerful framework with a large number of libraries and a low entry threshold. There are a lot of applications written in Angular 1.x.x and developers can’t rewrite them from scratch because of the huge code base, lack of knowledge or simply because there is no business need. At the same time, you have to add new features to the existing application. But since people came up with better ideas, you have to move forward as well. The tips mentioned above can help you prepare your code to transition to Angular 4 which has many more benefits. So if you are interested, I recommend you to start from these articles .

Once you may face a challenge of creating command-line interface with help of Node.js and in this article we will cover three useful modules, that will help you to complete this task. Parsing Parsing options is probably the most important task majority of command-line interfaces handle. So far the most popular node.js module for options parsing is optimist . This one is written by Substack, though in repo description he claims that he uses minimist . Seems like this dependencies relationship, when one module depends on another, performing mostly the same task and written by the same person reflects peculiarities of Node.js development cycle encouraged by npm package manager. Still I would like to explore another one module, also based on minimist, called realist . It completes the variety of programmer’s mental attitudes, initiated by optimist and minimist. There are two main features presented in the API of realist, which make me use it. The first one is beautiful commands schema template: In this hash we see reset command, which is followed by the required argument and also optional one. Any number of commands can be created with required, optional or even without arguments at all, throw pillows on saleof them were matched, default command will be executed. The second feature I would like to describe is event model used in application. Here is the list of events send within the application: option <option name> - sent if option was specified. candidates - command not found, but there are some candidates. By default it's handled by missingRequiredArgument handler. default - default command was called. Coloring The next priority for the command-line interface apps in my opinion is output beautifying. Many of users are afraid of console because it seems to them unclear and coloring the output may dramatically improve the readability of the data written. Let’s look at the module chalk by sindresorhus. Here is the image of transformations it allows to perform to text: Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want: Autocompletion Autocompletion in the command line is one of the main features, which allow it to stay in many cases much more effective than any other interfaces. Recently a module implementing autocompletion in Node.js CLI apps gained huge popularity. It is called omelette . Here’s a demo from the repository: Here’s how we configure it: And then all we need to do is install autocomplete to the console, which is basically to add appropriate commands to configuration file. Made easy with such commands: In zsh, you can write these: In bash, you should write: I hope these modules will be helpful for you when developing console application. I just have only one thing to add: if you intend to develop a module which should be installed globally, never use CRLF as bash will fail on Linux while trying to interpret it.

By regularly organizing and hosting meetups of highest quality we improve collaboration and learning experience of IT specialists from all parts of Ukraine. When organising an event, it is attention to each detail what makes our meetups exceptional and unique. EuroSTAR Roadshow 2016 competition resonated with our aspiration to support local QA community and that is why we took on a challenge of organizing QA meetup Learning to test, testing to learn competing with other companies from all over Europe. When thoroughly brainstorming the agenda for our event, we went through EuroSTAR conference programme and the latest quality trends, so we came up with the list of the actual topics our community might be interested in. When the list of topics was in place, we moved to finding speakers who could cover topics we shortlisted. We researched and watched dozens of conference videos with best ukrainian conference speakers and found perfect matches! Alexei Lupan, experienced QA trainer @ Astound Commerce, is an author of a popular QA blog testitquickly.com, that helps QA to establish the tester's mindset since 2007. The speaker was going to demonstrate the audience, how to apply test design techniques in a live session. Oleksandr Khotemskyi, QA Automation Lead @ Lohika, who also has QA mentoring experience, suggested to talk about a popular UI automation Framework, Protractor. Tatiana Shabskaya QA Lead at Binary Studio wanted to share her experience of testing in a distributed team. Viktor Tolkushyn QA engineer at Binary Studio prepared the presentation of another powerful UI automation tool - Ranorex. The interesting part is that all speakers had previous experience of coaching & mentoring QAs, so the meetup topic, “Learning to test, Testing to learn”, was quite close for them. So, we already had an interesting topic and great, experienced speakers with desire to share their knowledge. We had an agenda, so preparation has started. Having organized dozens of tech meetups we already had lots of know-hows and used our best practices to make this event exceptional. Location: Binary Studio office is a perfect place for meetups - it’s spacious, light and cozy. It can host up to 70 participants. Though we had more people willing to attend the event, all those who registered after 70 seats were taken - received a video recording of all the presentation right after the event. Format: four talks with 4 coffee breaks (5 hours in total) proved to be efficient and not tiresome. Preparation included: We engaged the audience with online campaigns on our web-site , on 2event web-site and on Facebook . We have opened the event with a welcoming speech from the organizers and introduced EuroSTAR 2016 conference. The first talk was: “How to approach testing in a distributed team”. Tatiana, speaker from Binary Studio, shared common problems that distributed teams face, and suggested a few ways of mitigating them from her experience. The theme was quite actual: 95% of the audience had experience of working in distributed teams, so participants contributed with their problem solutions as well. Our next speaker Oleksandr presented ProtractorJS , tool for end-to-end testing of web applications on AngularJS. He has experience of successful automation projects with this tool, and he is writing his own library for this tool. Oleksandr also answered many question that QA automation specialists faced while using this tool. He shared his own tips and tricks, compared ProtractorJS vs Java frameworks and pointed out ProtractorJS role in Selenium Webdriver ecosystem with deeply explained pros and cons. The topic sparkled lively interest in the audience and the discussion continued at the coffee break. QA Trainer Alexei Lupan shared information about test design techniques as a live session, so it initiated very intense discussion too. We revised a lot about test design and received another point of view on some classic techniques, such as Boundary value analysis, Equivalence class partitioning, Decision tables and many others. We closed the meetup with the presentation about Ranorex Studio , UI automation tool the audience was not familiar with. Viktor explained how you can automate your UI testing using this tool and what are Ranorex hottest features. Testing with Ranorex is a good example of testing to learn. It has everything to start automating your tests, even if you have minimum knowledge of the automation process and the tool itself. However, its potential is unleashed when the user gets more experience with it, and the more you use it and test with it, the more you learn how to use its advanced features. Next few days were quite busy as well. We gathered feedbacks from our attendees & speakers, posted photos and shared videos of the talks. The participants particularly praised: Here are some feedbacks we translated from ukrainian & russian: “You are Amazing, folks! Perfect from A to Z. I came from Kharkiv and did not regret!” “Organization was great, keep it up! Go on to invite interesting speakers, as you have done this time.” “To be honest, initially my reason to go on this meetup was Alexei Lupan with his topic, but it exceeded my expectations! An interesting and easy to understand talk by Sasha Hotemskoj, no less informative and useful talk by Tatiana. I’m glad that format of the event gave all attendees to discuss with presenters all questions after the speech. Thank you for such an open format. In general, well done! Keep it up! I’m looking forward to the announcement of the next events.” “I really liked \"Test Design\" and \"Test automation with Ranorex studio\" talks. There is a wealth of experience to the speakers, Alexey presented to the audience his vision of test design, other processes and relationships. And it was interesting to hear about the work of Ranorex studio and its capabilities for testing desktop applications.” “Useful information, a good place, nice organizers and surprising banquet.” “Everything was as I expected, even better. Amazing location, great community, schedule like on clock and I'm looking forward for next one.” “Interesting topics and talks. Good organization (event started on time, balanced number of participants - not too much but also not empty hall, no technical problems). Great t-shirts and delicious food.” “I liked that it was not only dry theory, but there were at least some examples with code fragments.” “Talk about ProtractorJS was very deep and structured. Thank you guys to make it happened.” We Learned, We Tested and We connected our local QA community. Everything that was planned - was done! We are grateful to EuroSTAR for encouraging companies to organize cool events and develop local communities! Looking forward to meeting you in Stockholm!

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "love-hate-electron", "author": ["Bogdan Rusinka"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2017/09/12/love-hate-electron/", "abstract": "A few years ago, I couldn’t imagine a solid desktop application written with Javascript, HTML and CSS. Today, I know that it is not only possible, but probably the most convenient and efficient way to do so - via Electron. Electron’s history started a few years ago (sometime around 2013) as a cross-platform application shell created for Atom (a text editor with extensibility like in Vim and a user-friendly UI like in Sublime). Now it is “a framework for creating desktop applications using html, javascript and css” (c) . It gives you the ability to implement not only a desktop application itself, but installers, automatic application updates and access to native features exposed by Javascript API like menus, icons, window appearance, and etc. Not so long ago, the list of applications written with Electron had around 40 apps in it. Zeplin, Postman, WordPress, GitBook and many other applications we became familiar with are available as desktop applications. Now the list has almost 400 applications. I have several desktop applications written with Electron in continuous use - Hyper, Skype For Linux, Postman, Compass, Zeplin, Slack. I’ve been a part of a team developing a commercial application using Electron for a year and a half. Now it’s time to share some pros and cons about it. One of the main benefits of writing desktop applications with Electron is that there’s no necessity to learn a new technology or a new language. This is a “win-win” situation for both businesses and developers. From a business perspective, the same hired team working on a web-application can easily implement a desktop application. Several things from the web-application can be reused in the desktop app: This, of course, saves time and money. From a developer’s point of view, it is only necessary to learn a few things on how Electron works and what API it exposes. As a result, a desktop application can be set up in a few days. Without specific knowledge, our team implemented a POC version of a desktop application within a week for MacOS, Windows and Linux. This proves how simple the process of creating desktop apps is. Electron uses the Chromium engine for rendering the UI. This means you can get several benefits from this: Bleeding edge features from ES2016/17 . As Electron uses the Chromium engine - you’ll have most of the recent features available in Chrome. E.g. you can use generators, promises, classes and other features from EcmaScript specification. Developer tools . You don’t have to think about external tools to debug your code. You can perform actions in a habitual way. It is easy to measure performance, conduct profiling or detect memory leaks with the beloved Chrome dev tools. Quick design changes can be done with an embedded CSS editor. Hot / Live reload . One huge benefit is the possibility to use live or even hot reloading to see changes instantly. Hot reload allows you to see the changes without reloading the page - e.g. font-size or color changes. LiveReload automatically reloads your page whenever you save changes in the editor. This seems minor but makes a big difference in the development experience. Storage access . With Chromium you get free access to any kind of storage available in browser - LocalStorage, SessionStorage, IndexedDB to persist application state. Another benefit of using Electron is the presence of a rich community. Ready to use packages allow you to focus on development rather than reinventing the wheel. Due to Electron’s growth in popularity, dozens of packages appear on npm to make development easier. Here’s the list of packages available for use for building, signing, testing, upgrading the application and many more other actions. Boilerplates and custom components are also present in that list. Electron saves a developer’s time by providing a convenient API for OS integration so they don’t have to think about implementation details - you can just use what is there. Among commonly used components and APIs, there are: Another awesome feature is the possibility to manage a window’s lifecycle easily (expand/collapse window, maximize/minimize, make it invisible or hide controls only). One of the main challenges after application development is packaging, creating installers and uninstallers, etc. Mostly you need this on Windows systems. Here again you don’t have to think much. Squirrel library is a set of tools to manage creating installers and auto updates. There are plenty of wrappers for that purpose from reliable sources . This means you don’t have to write something yourself to do some routine stuff. Now it’s time to talk about things that might make you unhappy when you encounter them for the first time. An awesome fact about Electron is that with a few commands from the terminal you can package your application and use it on any platform. However, things get worse when you have to use a specific library or a package written in C++ (e.g. PhantomJS). Such dependencies should be compiled on each system separately. This may require the dev team to have several PCs with different operating systems to provide a customer with an application package for each platform. On our project, where each member had a separate machine with a specific OS for building the app, we were able to test the application on different platforms while developing regular features. This means having different machines for development actually is a decent tradeoff compared to what you should do if you want to develop an application for each major desktop platform. When developing the application, our team encountered one small issue. It was necessary to set an icon for the app. This icon should appear in the tray, the list of running processes on Windows and, of course, near the name of the executable file. Easy. In theory, you can do that by setting a particular property in the configuration file and you’ll be almost satisfied with the result. You might be surprised if you don’t get your expected result. You won’t see the icon in the task manager because there’s no obvious way to do that with the Electron API. However, the Electron community found a solution for such unpleasantness. There’s a tool named Resource Hacker which allows you to add metadata to your package or executable file and change the icon as well. As I mentioned previously, some components are already present out of the box, like main or context menus. You don’t have to think about cross platform design to make those parts of the app look and feel native. But that’s as much as you are offered. If you want something else to look native - you have to implement that manually. Again, the benefit of the web ecosystem helps you cope with this issue. You can use a Photon library that provides native MacOS design to your application or a React Desktop package that has some components designed specifically to resemble Window 10 applications. Actually, not every design can be implemented with the suggested tools and there’s much to improve / implement in Electron, but who cares when you can design a DESKTOP application with CSS? To recap all these ideas, I can say that Electron is a tool worth looking into. Nowadays, it is a mature technology which has shown itself worthy in a production environment. The growing community solves tons of issues allowing you to focus on the development and the business logic of applications. I think, it is the best way to write desktop applications at the moment. Just try it, and I am sure you will be happy with results.", "date": "2017-10-10"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "typescript-helps-write-better-code", "author": ["Dmitriy Beseda"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2017/08/11/typescript-helps-write-better-code/", "abstract": "The TL;DR answer is - yes, Typescript can really help. For me, there are two main characteristics of good code: As a developer, my main task is to implement a program that works perfectly and meets the user’s expectations. That's why we write tests and hire QA engineers to be sure that everything works as intended. At some point we need to improve or re-implement some functionality which will require a lot of effort as the application’s complexity grows every day. That’s why we should keep code readability as high as it is possible, because it is essential to simplify such changes and decrease their cost. Javascript is a friendly and powerful language but sometimes its flexibility and simplicity doesn’t help those who use it. In this article, I’ll explain my view on how writing JS code using the Typescript superset increases its quality. There are 3 types of errors that can occur in code: Typescript can’t do anything with logical errors, but it checks syntax and semantic errors before code goes to production. It builds a type map and checks whether they are matched with actions you are trying to make with them and throws an error when a mismatch occurs. Also it checks the syntax to prevent small mistakes when you, for instance, forget to end a line with ‘;’ or set the wrong order of “?” and “:” symbols in the ternary operator. One of the tangible and universally recognized advantages of JS development is the speed of development one can achieve. One of the factors is that there are no ahead-of-time compilation steps and hence no waiting - you hit the “save” button and immediately view the results of the changes. But the toll for this speed is semantic errors due to the lack of compile-time checks. You will often be able to find errors immediately and fix them (which of course requires some time), but the scary part is when such errors appear unexpectedly. When you implement a feature, you have a limited amount of mock test cases and at the most liable moment you may expect a number but receive a string from the server and get NaN as a result of the calculation. Just defining the following basic data types helps you avoid such errors: Using such an approach is similar to giving a promise to the rest of the team that if you declare a variable as a number, for instance, - this will only be a number and nothing else. Furthermore, the argument about the inconvenience of an additional step in the build pipeline fades away as all modern frameworks require transpiling ES2016 to ES5 to achieve full browser support and we end up having one build tool or another processing our source files - be it gulp or webpack. Typescript also provides the following advanced types: We all are the end-users of complex products. Take a car as an example. It is really hard to figure out how everything works in detail and I am sure that it is redundant. It is only necessary to have a high-level knowledge of how the device works. So, you know what data you’ll get as an input and implement the necessary functionality to return an output, which other developers expect to get as an input for his module. The same is true for programming. One of the most important reasons why JS is so popular nowadays is that it has a huge and vibrant community. There is a copious amount of open source libraries which increase development speed several times over and help you avoid reinventing the wheel. And just as it is for cars, I just want to see the interface to quickly figure out what data is required for input and what result I can achieve. Of course, you can read the documentation but it requires additional time and effort on your part. I like to read code as a book without tons of documentation. For instance, take a look at the following snippet of code from the “Grommet” library that describes options for select control: From my point of view, writing documentation is 100% necessary for libraries, but it should be separated from the code itself (except for very special exceptions). In this example, all these comments just prevent me from finding what I really need. I find the following version of this example much more informative: I can see everything I need within this concise snippet: But if we take a look at a pure JS implementation of such an interface it won’t be as informative as the Typescript version: Microsoft provides a great tool for navigation inside a project and shows its details in any part of the application. This tool is called IntelliSense. It exempts you from searching throughout a whole application for details like the type of a parameter, properties of an object and even values I can put inside an array. Just by hovering over a method’s name you can get its signature that in most of the cases is enough to understand how to work with it. And if you need more details, you can go to its implementation just by pressing a hotkey. Of course, you can achieve similar functionality using a bunch of plugins for popular text editors, like Sublime or Visual Code, but it won’t be as good as what Typescript provides. The reason for this is that Typescript defines static types and it builds a metadata tree with maximum precision. In pure JS, it is necessary to rebuild this tree over and over when you type a new line of code because JS has dynamic typization and there is a chance that a property type can be changed. In the case of an object, it's hard to even detect the amount of properties. With the help of generics you can get all the benefits of IntelliSense, even using methods which can receive parameters of different types, because Typescript will set an exact output type according to the types of input. There are a few scenarios when you may not want to use static types. For instance, most libraries today are implemented using pure Javascript and while you use it, you may want to change its logic a bit, but the rest of the methods should stay the same. I’ve got this situation with the Grommet Select component.  The library didn’t work the way I expected it to, and to solve the issue it was necessary to add just 3 lines of code to this component. Here, I could extend the existing component and then override only one method. Of course, in this case, I didn’t want to spend a lot of time writing all the properties types for the component. It could be easily implemented thanks to the “any” type in Typescript. When Typescript parses the code and builds its tree, in cases where the compiler can’t figure out the type immediately, it just sets it it as “any.” In this case, type validation won’t be strict for such variables. There are other tools which would make several passes through the tree to set the exact type for each variable. If you need such strictness, you can take a look at the “Flow.”Typescript has plenty of syntactic sugar Typescript is a superset of Javascript. This means that it is not a brand new language, but it extends an existing one. When you run the Typescript compiler - it transpiles TS code to JS. There are a few features that just make your code more readable and force you to follow conventions, but after compilation, these rules could be broken in pure JS. One such feature is encapsulation . Typescript supports access modifiers and will notify you if you try, for instance, to use private variables outside their class.  However, if you run transpiled code - you could get access to them. Another feature is methods overloading . We can define a few signatures and build one method with separate processing for different inputs. There is one disadvantage in Typescript with such an approach compared to conventional static-typed languages. In C#, for example, you can specify several methods with the same name but different input parameters and C# will resolve the method to be called at runtime. In TS, you should check variables manually and call the necessary part of the code (for instance, you can implement it with a switch statement). One more sweet feature is enums . Enums are useful when you have some codified entity inside an app, for instance, the day of the week. In this case, you can use an enum to write what this code means instead of an integer value, you shouldn’t remember all these codes by heart. Also, you can get a string value of the used enum item. When creating complex applications, we rely on lots of conventions in a number of libraries, frameworks and even arrangements inside a team but there are no mechanisms to check all of them all the time. Typescript is a powerful JS superset that helps you write more readable and more reliable code. It provides you an ability to set rules of different levels of strictness for your team to achieve following conventions and increase code reliability. Typescript is a mechanism to easily enforce these conventions in your team in any amount you want.", "date": "2017-10-09"},

His customer called, complaining about a few issues they saw, so Ben had to schedule another hotpatch and re-assign resources, taking them from a new feature which had to go out in the next release. That meant that a few people who worked hard to stay on schedule and accomplish their primary goals had to switch context, work on a hotfix and follow up with the customer on the fix. The day became more stressful when he realized that the issues reported by the customer were known at least 4 releases ago and were already piled up with other minor bugs on a dumping ground they called “bug tracker.” He opened the issue list. 2,000 open issues that nobody wants to touch. How did it become that messy? It’s not like they were not doing bug fixes at all. During each release, they were fixing all the major bugs and left the known minor ones for later. But that later never came. What is the source of evil in this story? A few things, primarily the absence of an accurate strategy for dealing with minor issues, and no balance between scope, time and technical debt. Assuming you are working on a long term project, you will probably find yourself in a situation when your bug tracker becomes a collector’s edition for all sorts of minor bugs. How do you find your way out? What are the possible avenues? The following is not a step-by-step instruction - the contexts of different projects are too different. Instead, the following should help you define your own strategy for dealing with bugs. Where to start? The first thing you have to do is to understand the problem . Allocate some time to ask yourself the following questions: When the problem is defined, find the bottleneck in your defect management process. Here are some leading questions: Identify the cause . In a retrospective, try to remember the context and actions (or no action) that led to the bottleneck appearing. Finally, take action . We need to solve 2 problems now. First, come up with a plan on how to deal with the 2,000 issues in your tracker. Then, create a working process of preventing the same situation from happening again. Defining a strategy for taking action There is no silver bullet that works in every case. But here are general recommendations that worked at our company which you may apply. General approach Your plan will be the following: So, first of all, don’t hesitate to communicate the problem with your team. They should be aware of the benefits you are aiming to gain by solving the problem. That should prevent resistance for change. They also might suggest brilliant ideas for solving the problem. Now, let’s start with dealing with that pile of bugs. First, let’s imagine your bug report review workflow for every single issue. If you want, you can take a pencil and visualize your workflow as a flowchart. Now, for each box, put some time estimate - whatever it takes on average in your day-to-day basis.  Let’s look at this workflow as an example: Now, multiply the given numbers for time estimates for time estimates by 2,000. Though the estimate is really raw, now you can imagine the required effort to review the issue list once. But that’s not a one time activity - you won’t be able to fix all 2,000 issues in the upcoming release, so consider multiplying that number until the pile is dealt with. We also didn’t calculate any bug fixing and bugfix testing efforts. Though it sounds scary at first glance, you might find out that just closing the old issues that had no action in some definite time would be much more cost efficient for your project than to review and fix them, if the product in its current state is of sufficient quality. Given the bugs we are reviewing were all defined as minor, and no customers complained in all those years, maybe that is true for you - but see for yourself. That’s not necessarily a solution that would suit you. Again, the contexts and quality expectations vary from project to project. Just define what suits you best - your goal is to take action on that pile of bugs. If you see that indeed closing old issues is the best solution in terms of efficiency, then set a date that you still consider valid for bug reports and just close issues which are older. For the remaining not-so-old issues, schedule some time in the project timeline and categorize issues as follows: Close all items that are not harmful to the business (you can still aggregate and submit them as an improvement suggestion so they go under your feature/improvement process). Prioritize those that are considered harmful and discuss the scope with business users. Communicate the decision with the business team . They might be against this decision at first, but they should see the economic benefit. They also might provide your team with a list of business-harming issues they think are critical to fix. If the project context requires it, communicate the decision with customers . That might be tricky, especially if you have an open bug tracker. You might want to invest some additional effort in reviewing your customers’ issue lists and come up with the items that should be fixed after all. But then, fix them as soon as possible and close the remaining. Now it’s time to develop some preventive measures. Let’s start with small steps. Set Time To Live (TTL) for bugs in the tracker - close them automatically when a certain time passes. Of course, you can initiate some closing activities prior to that if your process enforces that. Decide on a percentage of minor and trivial bugs in your tracker which you can live with. Common sense dictates that you won’t be able to fix everything in a release. Set a separate value for each product area based on the risk of that area. Make sure you don’t exceed this criteria after each release, and if you do, plan your next release accordingly to meet the criteria again. Set the definition of a defect - maybe during your review process, you will notice that some filed items are not in the scope of the project at all. Filing and reviewing such issues is a waste of project time. Communicate this definition with the team. Do not be afraid to share responsibility. Divide the scope among your team members. You can divide the scope by different criterion. Assigning responsibility to review tasks per sub-system or project area worked for us. Remember before how we discussed categorizing issues as harmful and not harmful to business? Add your criteria to the definition of a bug. Set up a triage process . In short terms, the triage is a process of prioritization. You already have it in one form or the other in your team if you’ve ever set the priority for an issue. But since we divided the scope among the team, it is important to have a common vision of the prioritization process. Set a timeline for reviewing and suggest the approach, including a strategy of dealing with minor bugs. As an example, during the triage, you might want to prioritize the issues as follows: If you think a minor issue is not critical enough to be fixed in the next 3-4 releases, and your criteria allows you to live with it, just close it. Otherwise, you’ll end up with a pile of minor bugs again. Review the definition of a defect regularly. Involve your business team. Monitor support issues and audience feedback for better bug definitions and their severity in your project context. Summary Managing bugs is painful. Though setting up the process of dealing with bugs might seem like a boring and bureaucratic procedure, it is a necessary evil compared to the risk of dealing with a pile of issues, where the important ones might be lost due to a large total number of bugs or to risk delaying the project schedule when it could be avoided.", "date": "2017-09-21"},

Great! But how do you go about actually finding your perfect outsourcing team? Well, it’s not as simple as googling “outsourcing” and picking the first result. You should consider what kind of team you want to put together, the requirements for the specific task, and other factors regarding getting your project started and on track. This short guide will help you formulate a plan of action regarding your project - from inception to execution and beyond. Bear in mind that choosing an outsourcing company is a long and arduous journey, but one that can really pay for itself in terms of helping you find the high-quality specialists you need to get your product to market. Step 0:  What do I want from my outsourcing partner? The clearer idea you have about what you want the outsourcing team to do, the easier it is going to be to make the right choice about whom to go with. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard someone say “I got a great idea!” and then as soon as I start asking them remotely detailed questions about their proposed project they simply shrug their shoulders and say, “that’s for the developers to figure out.” Developers are not designers. Nor are they marketers, or salespeople, or testers. Those are separate specialists which you may (or may not) have to recruit in order to finish your project. The more you flesh out your idea prior to contacting the first outsourcing company on your list, the less headaches you’re going to have further down the line. Many outsourcing companies will be happy to take whatever vague idea you have and transform it into something, but by doing some planning prior to reaching out to them, you’re going to ensure that their work matches closer to what you want to accomplish. Make a Model Try to put together some concrete expectations and functionality of your project. Consider making a wireframe, mock up, or some documentation and specifications for the project which you have in mind. The more information you can provide, the better! The outsourcing company might suggest some changes based on their experience and professional opinion, but that’s fine - at least they have a better idea of what you are looking for, right from the start. Step 1:  Outsourcing, outstaffing - what’s the difference? The next most important question is determine what sort of team model you want to put together for your project. This is a particularly confusing part for people who are new to outsourcing, and can cause a lot of frustration to clients if they end up getting stuck with the wrong model for their needs. Outsourcing In traditional outsourcing , you hire an external company to provide a complete software solutions package. Maybe you are not a tech person, and want to supplement your own business with a technology solution, or start a completely new project based on a particular idea. In this case, you would like the outsourcing company to handle the development, management, and design of the project based on your specifications - it is ultimately the outsourcing company’s responsibility to provide you the final product you want. Here at Binary Studio, we refer to this as custom software development . This is a good fit if you want to contract the whole project out to a 3rd party outsourcing company. HINT: Other names of this sort of model: standalone outsourcing services, and custom software packages . Outstaffing In outstaffing, you already have an existing team working on a particular project, and you need some help. Perhaps you would like to add a long-term member to your development team, or need a stop-gap replacement for a developer who dropped from the project, or maybe you just want an external tester to run through your code to check for bugs. With this option, you still hold the responsibility for the project, and the outsourcing company simply provides you the qualified staff to do the job. We call this a dedicated development team, but it’s also commonly referred to as a extended, or integrated development team, and occasionally staff augmentation . This option best suits you if you have an in-house development team, or you are working on the technical side yourself and need qualified help. HINT:  This approach is sometimes referred to as an extended, or integrated development team, as well as staff augmentation. Step 2:  What will my software be running on? You also will need to determine what platforms and operating systems the software will run on: If you are unsure about what platforms and system you should use, you can always find a competent technical expert to discuss the different options with you. Ideally you will want to choose someone who you can trust with this consultation - and be careful with inquiring directly with the software development company you plan to work with. They may try to sell you an apple when you really need an orange! Step 3:  What outsourcing relationship do you need? Hiring an outsourcing company establishes a business relationship, and it is important to establish your needs and rules up front so as to better determine what kind of outsourcing solution you need. For example - how long are you planning to utilize the outsourcing company? Maybe you are looking for a quick review of your existing code to determine any improvements or fixes which may be needed. Or perhaps you are only interested in a long-term commitment from a developer who will basically be an extension of your existing team. Perhaps you seek only a senior development team to carry your complex project to fruition, or maybe you are comfortable taking on some juniors who are more affordable and able to follow your in-house tech lead’s instructions more than adequately. Answering these sorts of questions in advance will save you time when you start shopping around for different outsourcing companies, because you will quickly be able to see which companies are better suited toward your needs. Step 4:  Starting the search Okay, now that you have a good idea of what your project is going to entail, you can start searching in the appropriate places. Obviously, you could just google it. Just remember that the results you see are there because the companies have good SEO, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be your perfect fit! Instead, we’d recommend basing your search on whether you are hunting for a long-term or short-term project. Long-term projects For long-term projects, there are plenty of resources out there that provide a very in-depth view of a company which can help you decide whether they’d be a good fit for your project. We personally recommend clutch.co . Here, for example,  you can take a look at our company’s profile as an example and see very detailed feedback from our past clients as well as a good overview of the portfolio we have built over the years. Tech conferences are also a solid choice, as many serious outsourcing companies attend the larger ones which occur all around the world. This allows you to have some face time with your potential outsourcing partner and get a good feel of what they are about. Short-term projects Regarding more short-term contracts, something like UpWork may be perfect for your project’s needs. For one, you can hire a freelancer directly (without paying the overhead of a full agency), and you can also find companies who have developers which are available at this very moment and ready to jump on-board immediately. Bear in mind that not all outsourcing companies have someone “on the bench” and available to work on a short term project, although if you’d like to work with a specific company it never hurts to ask! Step 5:  Exercise Due Diligence Due diligence is about checking a potential candidate carefully before signing a contract. There are obviously several considerations here but cost is not the sole factor. You should have a basic idea of what you can afford to spend on this project before you even start putting together a model of what you’d like to build. This will have an immense influence on the quality of work you are able to hire, what kind of features you can include, and how much time and resources you are willing to put into getting the project done properly. Narrowing it down Once you have a budget in mind, take your short list of possible candidates and compare them on quality and capabilities, not cost. Saving 10, 25, or even 50% on a contract is not going to be worth the savings if you are left with a poor product. Do your research. Schedule phone interviews, and talk with the developers with whom you will be directly collaborating about your project, even if it means getting them to sign NDA’s. Make sure you have good communication with each person you will be in contact with, and keep in mind all the nuances such as time zone differences, cultural considerations, language barriers, and what sort of communication tools and systems you and the outsourcing company will be using in order to stay on the same page during the development process. Don’t judge only by price This is the biggest pitfall that people make when selecting an outsourcing company, and by far the most common. People take a shortlist of candidates and go for the lowest bidder. Perhaps in some situations this is an appropriate method of selecting a long-term business partner, but in my experience it will just lead to dissatisfaction for all parties concerned. If you are going to commit to such a big endeavor, you owe it to yourself and your project to check and make sure you are choosing the company which is the best fit for your needs. Step 6:  Step back and review the contract After you have made your selection, take a moment to step back and contemplate the project as a whole. Check your finance department if everything is in order, talk with your in-house team to see if they are satisfied with your selection, and then make well-informed decision on writing up a contract. A six or twelve month commitment is worth the extra preparation in order to ensure that you will be satisfied with the final product. S tep 7:  Commit, and stay connected Once you have the project rolling, don’t stay passive during its development! Developers love frequent, constructive feedback to help guide them in their efforts. There is nothing worse than writing up a bunch of code only to see it thrown away because it didn’t fit the client’s vision. This is why it’s important to establish good communication before the contract is even made - it sets the standard for how the developers and client will disseminate information to each other. Conclusion With these points in mind, your outsourcing endeavors will surely yield positive results and a strong business relationship which can last years, providing you with a valuable resource which can transform your ideas and projects into highly effective software solutions.", "date": "2017-09-14"},

Quality is achieved by putting development and testing into a blender and mixing them until one is indistinguishable from the other.” – How Google Tests Software James A. Whittaker , Jason Arbon , Jeff Carollo In this article, I present the real and proven benefits when your development team has a QA specialist, based on our experiences here at Binary Studio. In a nutshell, QA’s role is (1) to ensure that the application meets the requirements as well as the needs of the business and customer, (2) to prevent issues and problems, but also (3) to make sure that the implementation of a new feature does not break other functionality that was already built. One of the intellectual traits of the QA engineer is thoroughness. It is supported by the knowledge of test design techniques, which in turn makes it possible to predict and prevent future issues, and to verify compliance of the current functionality to the requirements. Getting the implemented functionality from the developers, the tester scrutinizes  whether the functionality is fulfilling its intended purpose. This is why it helps to perform an exhaustive check of the functionality. Exploratory testing is not chaotic and random, it is ad hoc with the clear purpose of finding bugs. It is an approach that helps the tester learn how to use an application which encourages creativity, intuition and critical thinking. For example, it’s unlikely that things the software should not do will be documented. It’s driven by the fact that we can’t imagine every possible route or action, particularly when it relies upon unpredictable users. Because of this, the quality of tests which cover that depends on the experience and critical thinking of QAs. It’s important to detect as many defects as possible, even if they have low priority, because it can be a base for bigger problems. And a tester will deeply explore the software while they perform various scenarios, combine input data, and conducts chains of actions. Everyone is familiar with Agile methodology and the tester’s role in it. Agile means lean and flexible processes, where testing happens throughout each iteration to provide a high quality product at the end of the sprint. So how does the QA specialist establish a well-defined process? Based on our experience in the implementation of dozens of IT projects, we can say that the estimation time to deliver a product can be increased dramatically if there is no strictly-dedicated QA on the project. This is due to the fact that the development process is chaotic and it is based on merging several roles into one. The productive way is to test functionality during each iteration, not in the end . Here are some arguments for this: First, the most obvious point is that while the developers have the task of delivering working code, the QA staff is responsible for ensuring the code reaches an acceptable level of reliability, performance, and functionality before it goes into production. The next thing that a QA engineer brings to the project is the sequence in the development process. It lies in the fact that a verification of functionality will occur at the start of the project, then at the stage of its visual presentation (mockups, wireframes) and finally, at the stage of its implementation. Along with this, a QA specialist defines and improves the processes and procedures related to quality. Do not forget that a tester analyzes the level of quality and prepares a release report on this at the delivery stage. Within a stipulated time, the customer receives a ready-made working solution and detailed information about its quality. Technical debt is \"a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution.” One of the types of technical debt is regression testing. Above all, its goal is to ensure that the existing functionalities work correctly and no errors occur due to the development of other, seemingly independent, functionalities. But with each new iteration and implementation of new functionality over old, the level of regressive technical debt increases. To reduce this debt, a QA engineer performs the regression testing each sprint. Automation is a key to regression testing, because manual testing can be very time consuming and expensive. The standard for regression testing is to perform it each sprint before deployment. But with every new bit of functionality, the amount of tests will only increase. To have the opportunity to have more time for exploratory and thorough testing of new implemented functionality - old tests should be automated. It’s not enough to just detect a failure — you have to prevent it from making it to production. This implies that the risks need to be identified. This starts early in the project, and uses that knowledge of risk to guide testing planning, specification, preparation and execution. Usually it requires a series of brainstorming sessions and it is important to document all the identified risks to system quality. Therefore it is a collective effort, driven by the testing team, which helps determine what areas of the application need maximum focus. It gives the QA team good direction on how to proceed with their activities. Also, by identifying areas of concern early, developers are able to proactively remediate and reduce the overall risk of a production defect. We don’t live in a perfect world and there is no 100% effective test approach to ensure that the delivered application will be bug-free. However, there is huge value in guaranteeing  that critical issues in the application will not be discovered by end users. During the development process, a test engineer is wearing an end-user’s hat , by acting and performing different user scenarios and applying testing strategies. This also includes knowledge of what end users expect from working with the product. The more you know the product, the better you can test it. With an understanding of business goals and knowledge of the domain this provides a solid insurance policy for the development team and the product. “Testing is a process, not a single activity.” Binary Studio QA engineers are involved in the project from the very beginning, when functionality is still nothing more than an idea. The development team does not have much clarity, and they do not know exactly how it will be built. The most important task at this stage is thorough understanding and potential assistance in defining acceptance criteria - what success means for customers, thanks to the knowledge of tech design techniques and the experience of using it., These criteria will provide the main direction for the entire team at the development stage. Also, during the Inception phase, a QA specialist designs a testing proposal with testing strategy, approaches, test result reports and communication procedures. Then, the QA’s work covers the whole software testing life cycle, including assistance in critical requirements analysis, test management, test design, and the execution of testing, as well as improving the quality process. We believe that preventive and proactive testing approaches are the best solution and help identify issues in the early stages of the project. Moreover, it will minimize maintenance and debugging costs compared to a reactive style of testing and can be useful in providing suggestions for improving the software. Then, during beta-release, our team will perform stress testing to monitor performance and make sure that your solution is in “tune” before release.", "date": "2017-09-14"},

On the one hand, bug fixing is expensive in terms of both time and money. It takes resources and time that could be allocated to new feature development, pushing your project back. On the other hand, not fixing bugs is risky for the development process, business and even for end-users’ lives in some cases. It creates obstacles and technical debt. It makes users unhappy and leads to costly outcomes in fulfilling the business need. So what is the proper solution? The trick is in fixing the right stuff. You should balance between bug fixing and implementing new requirements by properly prioritizing your bug fixes. Matt was really passionate about his project. He strived for a booming, successful first release and worked hard to achieve it. He tried to polish every detail to get the job done. He was not tolerant of any bugs left in the bug tracker at all. The workflow was simple: every bug found was assigned, fixed and tested. New features were delayed until the bugs were fixed, increasing the project time and budget. That resulted in a release which was 2 years behind schedule. Though the quality was good, the market had moved on, and the released product was already outdated. Probably, at some point of the project lifecycle, Matt asked himself if he is moving the project in the right direction and if he really needs to fix every single bug. If you were to solve the problem similar to Matt’s, you’d start with answering some simple questions: If there is no prioritization process at all, you might end up in a situation where you fix every single bug with a “first in-first out” strategy. Not a good idea - it is not a data-driven decision, and the business need and risks are not considered. Another thing that could go wrong is trying to fix every bug and delay a release until there is nothing left reported. Not a good idea either, as it does not consider cost efficiency and market demand changes. One more thing that usually goes wrong - sole decision making, which is prone to the Dunning–Kruger effect (a cognitive bias when you have the illusion that you know everything [ 1 ] ) and scores low on bus factor (a measurement of risk resulting from information not being shared with team members [ 2 ] ). It also creates a bottleneck if a person making decisions has other responsibilities and the scope is quite large. The last one is not necessarily a bad approach, but better to have it supported by data and be prepared for the risks. To have a better visualization of what we are trying to improve, imagine your bug lifecycle. Here is a simplified workflow: In most iterative SDLCs, the decision on when to fix it is made several times. Here is the same workflow, a bit more in detail: So, you should actually prioritize a few times when you analyze what implications the bug creates in the long and short term. You should understand that a bug report is not necessarily a ticket in your bug or task tracker. It can take multiple forms, depending on the project culture. Here are some of them: Sometimes the initial decision should be made fast, without waiting in the queue for prioritization by a single person, e.g. if the case will have a severe impact on the business. Also, the team should know when to say ‘no’ to unscheduled tasks that can wait and be allowed to make such decisions. So, with enough data, the whole team should be able to make a good short-term decision on a priority. You should provide your team with enough data to decide if it can wait or whether it should be brought up immediately and fixed as soon as possible. That way, if you are on vacation, they are not blocked. Here are some points that should be clear and accessible for everyone in the team: From the business side From the customer or end user side From the team and project side From the domain side Anyone from the team should be able to ask themselves to make an initial decision: if I refuse to fix it right away, how greatly would our business, end users or team be affected? If we leave it as it is for awhile, would there be severe implications? Select a way to share this information that suits you. For some points, it can be a wiki that is up to date and available for everyone. For other points, it can take a form of a meeting, e.g. a daily status meeting to see if anyone from the team is blocked . It can be a project plan that is available to everyone involved in the project, like a dashboard in the bug tracker with a specific data set. Explain to your business and support teams that it is not possible to fix every issue right away as it affects the schedule. Come to an agreement that the team has a right to say ‘no’ to unscheduled requests that don’t have severe implications. When the initial decision is made by you or the team, the bug goes to a shortlist or to a pool. Someone has to keep an eye on the entire list of known issues, even those items on the back burner. The list should be reviewed and prioritized regularly. Review and prioritization should be scheduled activities. Make sure you allocate time in the project for this officially, otherwise you might end up with delays in the review process or other tasks assigned to the reviewers. The review and prioritization of a bug report usually consists of the following: The process can be performed by one person or a triage committee, but in most cases there are usually a few people involved. Reproduction and information updates are performed before the categorization process and other team members can be responsible for this, e.g. a QA person. Risk analysis can take multiple forms, but the process is common with other project risk analysis techniques. Categorization Define a taxonomy for your bugs. You might want to add a few new fields to your bug report form to categorize items better. Here are some ideas of new fields to add. They will help you  assess risks and find areas to improve: Also, choose attributes by which you will make decisions on priority. There are a few approaches. Some suggest prioritization by severity, frequency and visibility, others - by severity and likelihood. You can choose attributes that matter to you. Here are a few examples: Prioritization The process is quite simple: we take a bug, fill in the bug categories, fill in the attributes we chose for prioritization - and then, based on the values, define the priority. We can use all parameters to make a decision, or a few of them. The following is just an example, and it varies from project to project. Define what suits you by yourself. In this example, it’s decided to categorize the issues by severity and frequency. Work format Meeting vs. review. Depending on the format of communication, it can be a meeting or an asynchronous reviewing process. There are pros and cons for each approach. The meeting requires more coordination effort, while the reviewing process requires discipline, continuous reminders and set deadlines. Single person vs. committee. A decision that was made single-handedly might not always be correct. One’s biases might affect the prioritization process greatly, so in some cases, actions can be taken to share responsibility and minimize the human factor. Depending on the number of people involved, it can be a single person decision, or a 2-3 committee decision. If one person is to decide, human factor is involved, whereas a committee decision is more objective, but it takes more time. Select the format that suits your project best and don’t forget that the key factor here is consistency. Plan this activity ahead and include it in the project plan using automatic reminders to help enforce the activity. When choosing which bugs to fix in the next iteration, it’s obvious we select high priority ones first - but that’s not the only item to consider. We should also select items that don’t depend on each other or at least assign counterdependent issues to the same person to avoid conflicts, while considering the required effort and doing items of the highest risk first to test them quickly. In his next project, Matt shared prioritization responsibility with the team. He kept everyone updated on the project goals and risks and gave the team a right to say ‘no’ to unreasonable changes. He improved the bug categorization process and defined priority selection criteria based on attributes. He scheduled regular prioritization meetings and involved a cross-functional triage committee in the process. He also prioritized bugs in the same iteration. With a well-defined bug prioritization process, Matt and his team had more time to focus on the items that were driving the project forward and avoided bottlenecks related to bug fixing activities. The prioritization process is a time-consuming activity, but doing it properly allows you to save valuable project time by fixing the right stuff while avoiding bottlenecks.", "date": "2017-09-07"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "software-versioning-windows-net", "author": ["Kirill Miroshnichenko"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2017/08/18/software-versioning-windows-net/", "abstract": "So, first of all, let’s start with the understanding of why we need to version our code. Actually, there are two kinds of versions: internal and public ( commercial or release versions). The internal version is what developers see. It’s simply a tracking of each code change. And, fortunately, VCS (Git, SVN, etc.) does it for us. That’s why it is also often called “ the revision. \" It allows us to refer changes in the task tracking systems, continuous integration systems (CI), and documentation. I’d call it a way to help organize your work. The public version is what end-users see. It’s a way to show that something new was added to the software. It also helps distinguish software releases and attach a change log to them. The software name stays the same but there is a different version name, which is a way to show the users that they could update to a newer, better version (if they pay for it!). 😉 Just don't forget: some companies also use codenames for their products in addition to the previous version types - a sort of alias of the actual combination of name and version. So, how does the version actually look like? Perhaps it is a silly question, and everyone who is familiar with the subject can give their own answer. But I’ll try to add something new, or at least, make a systematization. The internal version looks different depending on what VCS is used: The public version has a pretty standard format and it looks like this: XX . XX . XX . XX (At least the first two positions are used in most cases.) However, the values of each position are different from project to project, and from company to company based on their own conventions. There are no strict standards for assigning the version values, but there are popular options and recommendations. I will mention only the ones which are most-often used. In most cases, applications use the following schema: MAJOR . MINOR . BUILD . REVISION The main idea is to reflect the significance of changes. MAJOR means that the application received some significant changes, including some big, new features. It is often something incompatible with the previous versions. MINOR could show that the developers have done some minor work, fixed something, etc. BUILD and REVISION are often generated automatically by CI during the release. More strict rules for this schema are described in Semantic Version Specification ( http://semver.org ). It is quite cool, but requires careful manual tracking and coordination with a product manager, who actually decides from the commercial point of view when and what should be released and how it should be reflected in the version. Sometimes companies include another meaning of the version. For instance: MAJOR . MINOR . MAJOR . MINOR The first two positions are for a server-side version, the other two are for a client application version. Or like JetBrains does: YEAR . MAJOR . MINOR . 0 The first value is the year of release. And the MAJOR resets to 1 each year. There are additional options like including the alpha / beta / release-candidate letter mark into the version (e.g. 3.5 b .123.6897 or 2.3. a ), or exotic ones like 3.14159265 (idiosyncratic version in TeX) where developers just add an additional number to the version instead of incrementing it, or 50001 (flag system in BLAG Linux and GNU) where 5 is a major number and 1 is a minor one. But the main thing that we should think about is how we will compare versions. While it is possible to invent your own schema and convention, it should be possible to say which app version is newer. The version should be comparable . And here we are also bound to how operating systems treat version values. The version is usually included into the application metadata (e.g. the version inside an installer or in a file header). The OS retrieves and uses it to determine if it should allow the user to install an application or not, what component version to reference, etc. Also, almost all OSes allow you to enter only numbers in the version. Below I’ll talk about versions in Windows. Now then, let’s quickly cover the last type of versioning - codenames . Usually, it is something that could be used instead of or in addition to a version used inside a company or outside by users. For example, Electronic Arts uses the following names for their Battlefield game: And while we might think that the number is the version - it is actually not! The list above is sorted chronologically by release date. And the version number here is just a codename. Battlefield 1 has number 1 because it is about World War I, not because it is the first version. And 2142 is just some year in the future, since that game has a futuristic setting. Another example - Windows versions: Sometimes developers use codenames internally, for example, as it was with Windows Longhorn. But OK, enough boring theories… Now I’m going to go further and talk about what we wanted to achieve in our project, the approach we decided to use and what interesting stuff can be found in Windows and .NET in terms of versioning. We were not restricted when assigning numbers to a version. Yet, our own criteria for versions are: A popular option is to include the date into the version: year, month and day. But it could be possible to have few releases per month. So, all three parts of the date should be used. First of all, let’s check System.Version class that represents the version number of an assembly, operating system, or the common language runtime , and look what we can write into each version position. It has the following constructor: Version(Int32, Int32, Int32, Int32) However, if we speak about the assembly (or file) version - it’s not true. The VERSIONINFO structure (that is in the header of the files) stores the version as two 32-bit integers, defined by four 16-bit integers . So, the max possible version is FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.FFFF (in hex values). Each part is a WORD , not a DWORD ! OK,  clear enough. Let’s try to set the version for a .NET assembly: And here we get the second pitfall - the compilation error CS7034 : The specified version string does not conform to the required format - major[.minor[.build[.revision]]] Looking into MSDN about .NET assemblies we can find a strange restriction: All components of the version must be integers greater than or equal to zero. Metadata restricts the major, minor, build, and revision components for an assembly to a maximum value of UInt16.MaxValue - 1 . That means that each version value should be from 0 to 65534 (not 65535 !) or 0xFFFE (not 0xFFFF !). I’ve asked about it on Stack Overflow and I hope, someday, someone will explain what the max value is reserved for. Do you think that it is it? No! It is not so simple in Windows... Let’s do a small experiment. Since in any case we want to somehow deliver our application to users, we will face questions on how to install it. Let’s create an application and an MSI installer for it (WiX, Advanced Installer, Microsoft Setup Project or any other MSI-based technology). Now, set the assembly version to 5.0.0.0 and create the installer from it. The product version will be the same - 5.0.0.0 . Install it to the system. In the Windows Registry we can find the following records for our installed application: Now, set the version to 258.0.0.0 . Most likely, you, already understand what I’m trying to check. 🙂 Compile assembly, build the installer and run it over the already-installed version 5.0.0.0 . Our new version is definitely greater, however we get an error! For the version 258.0.0.0, the Registry will contain the following: It’s an overflow… Checking the MSI ProductVersion documentation gives us an answer: The first field is the major version and has a maximum value of 255. The second field is the minor version and has a maximum value of 255. The third field is called the build version or the update version and has a maximum value of 65,535. But also don’t forget that 65535 can not be used too because of the .NET limitation! Why, Microsoft, why is everything different in your products?... Also note that MSI doesn’t take into account the fourth part of the version . Returning to our project… looking at all the described pitfalls, we decided to fill the first three parts with the date. So, the version becomes something like: 17 . 6. 22 . XX (for commit from date 22.06.2017) Such a version is comparable, sortable, easy to understand and says the date when the last included code change was done. But on top of that we want to know the exact commit. In case of SVN, it is possible just to include the integer ID. And the version part will fit enough commit numbers. But unfortunately, we have Git with its large hex hash values… 0xFFFF is also forbidden. So, we took only the first three hex letters from the Git hash. Combining it with the known commit date, we can refer to the exact commit for sure. The commit on 22.06.2017 with hash ed8 d3da29cc65ed4c6635c4b186ba4810e71b892 becomes the version: 17 . 6. 22 . 3800 (3800 is a dec representation of ed8). Such a version is known from Git commit information and can be easily extracted during the build process. We don’t need to commit the version into a repository or do anything manually. We can just set it for the project automatically on the pre-build step and be happy. 🙂 Later, if it’s needed, it’s possible to quickly find the last commit done to the current release. It is simple. The max possible version of an application in Windows should be: 255 . 255 . 65534 . [65534] and only the first 3 parts are essential for the OS. This way you will not face any surprises. As for the value meaning - use whatever suits the project requirements, while it is sortable and comparable . And remember, that while having versions is essential for long-term projects, it also should be convenient to change and track them. I hope our experience will be helpful and save you some time when introducing your own versioning system!", "date": "2017-08-18"},

Responsive design for applications is easier than ever. Here you can read about 9 modern CSS features that are available to use today. Flex (or flexbox) is a feature that provides more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute free space between item even if their size is unknown or dynamic . Flexbox is known since 2009, but it changed its syntax and yet is not very popular. Today, major browsers support this feature, though if you need IE9 and lower support - you will be disappointed. If you want maximal compatibility with other browsers you need to write a full stack of rules in such manner: What are the main purposes you can use flexbox for? There are a few reasons for that: If you need a grid system based on flex, then Flexbox grid will be very helpful for you. You can read more about flex here . There’s enough examples to understand the basics. Internet provides you many playgrounds to use and try flex: So, just try it! This feature disables any events of a layer. It makes this layer “invisible” for a pointer. Also this feature can be useful if you want to optimize the speed of scrolling your page with enormous count of interactive elements. How does it works? While scrolling cursor of your mouse hovers elements and can cause reaction of elements on it, even if you don’t need it. This action says browser to repaint the rectangle with the element. Of course it’s not very important if we talk about a small element, but if number of elements is huge or you need to apply complex styles - you need to think about performance. In this case turning on is a very good idea to deal with. The other reason to use them is disabling upper layer. This example shows how it can be useful. Moreover, if you want your tab or menu item to be disabled while being active, you can use this property and be sure it will work properly. I have to mention it doesn’t work in IE10, but if you don’t worry about that - just try. This feature is known for frontend developers as clip, but it’s deprecated now and you have to use clip-path instead of it. Clip feature allowed to work only with rectangle properties.Clip-path allows you to work with any shapes - circle, rectangle, ellipse, stars and so on. Here you can try it and get any form you like - predefined or custom. What are the advantages of this feature? Disadvantages are also present: If you defined borders for object, they will be clipped. Despite this I think that it’s a cool feature that will help many frontend developers to create wonderful designs for image covers and other graphical elements. Some examples to look through: This feature allows to set element to a separate layer in order to prepare it for rendering. Sara Soueidan describes how to deal with this feature. Browser tries to optimize elements by itself. Simple operation like opacity changing doesn’t demand much CPU resources, but other operations such as transform can be a reason of slowing down page, especially when you have a big amount of them. One of the hacks to deal with that was usage of That demands browser to put an element to a new layer and optimize it using GPU resources. Using will-change you don’t need to worry about that - just use this property in your CSS code. But be careful - this is not always good for you. Compatibility - latest browsers work with it, except any IE or Safari. We only need to wait for other browsers to support this feature.. Good news for those who works with big blocks of text and don’t want to spend time to divide them into columns manually. With a single line you can specify any columns number for your text block in such way: Or set width in this manner: Decoration features allow you to set space between columns, draw a line between them. The problem with compatibility exists - IE9 and lower doesn’t support this feature - for others it is accessible but with prefixes mostly. CSS4 draft says that we will have a possibility to choose column with  :nth-column() pseudo class. This will allow us to set styles for each column separately. Sounds cool, we’ll see. As you know we use @media to define the screen size of a device and set proper styles depending on that. Though @media isn’t only for  that. So called “CSS4” provides new features as What does that mean? Now we can check and use styles for devices depending on their type. Johnathan Fielding describes what are these features for: Guess, you will like this feature. Though only IE Edge, and latest Chrome and Opera support them. Nothing is ideal! This feature is a so called photoshop in a pocket. Would you like to make your image red or green? Maybe you have two images you want to mix or have an unusual effect for them? Then blend-mode is for you. Just use the syntax mix-blend-mode: multiply; and choose images and colours for your background - ready! In your favour there’s a big number of blending-types: Normal, multiply, screen, overlay, darken, lighten, color-dodge, color-burn, hard-light, soft-light, difference, exclusion, hue, saturation, color, luminosity. They all can be applied to your image, or you can even choose some of them together and get unpredictable, but cool effect - just play with it. IE will disappoint you again, though you are alright with that, aren’t you? CSS4 is far from being in common use today, though W3c team works on it and publishes more and more new features. What are they? i.e. you have such selector -  .bock-item .child. There can be many items with .block-item class.  But you need the one with .child class. In this case parent selector will be very useful. All these features can be changed but do they give us now? Just let’s look at “:matches” pseudo selector. It uses cartesian product to get all matches for selectors. Doesn’t sound impressive? Look at how you need to write it now: Nice. What about variables? Define the one at the beginning and use it in you CSS anywhere. It’s already present in SASS and LESS you say? But what if you need to write on pure CSS without any preprocessors and libraries? This will help you so much. The only one bad news - currently unsupported. Let’s wait. Box-model is a well-known thing among frontend developers. It isn’t new (at least since 1998, when it was introduced). The main thing everyone should know is how the size of object is calculated: padding + border + width = actual rendered width padding + border + height = actual rendered height What’s the problem? Imagine you have menu with 5 items. Each you set 20% width. Then you decided to add border. You will get something like this: Using of box-sizing:border-box allows you to avoid such problem. This property will tell browser to calculate size of object with borders and padding (but not margins). The other property box-sizing:padding-box gives you same effect but without borders (only paddings included in calculations). Good news: supported everywhere! With prefixes in some case, but who cares when you have full cross-browser support? This is not a full list of features, which are accessible now or will be in future, just a part of it. Though most of them you can use now and feel the power of CSS. Hope you will find something new for yourself. Enjoy CSS!", "date": "2017-08-10"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "questions-to-ask-frontend-devs-during-an-interview", "author": ["Bogdan Rusinka"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2015/12/16/questions-to-ask-frontend-devs-during-an-interview/", "abstract": "Recently, I was asked to conduct a series of interviews and I would like to share my experience on this with you. Some of the guys were interviewed at Binary Studio Academy , which means that they are not even juniors yet while some even aimed for a senior position. That’s why the questions differed, but many of these have stayed the same. 1. How to vertically align a block with unknown height in the center of another block with known height? Those who have done some CSS work in their lives know that this is one of the most painful questions CSS cannot answer directly. The current trend of division markup is defeated by the table one. The trick is that table cells could have such property as: which will align the content in it vertically. In order to make divs work with this you need to create another one wrapper, give it and give the large div and then set constant height to it. More graceful solutions are possible when utilizing flexbox but they may not fit each project as they still have limited support. 2. How to center several blocks standing side-by-side horizontally with unknown width within another block with known width. There are two basic ways of putting blocks side-by-side: using float with either left or right value or display: inline-block. Without a doubt the second one behaves better, since it allows you to set on the parent block text-align: center, so that the task is done. But the problem is that this solution will not work in the older versions of Internet Explorer browser. Fortunately, Microsoft has plans to deprecate IE , which is why most of us no longer have to worry about it. For projects which still tend to support IE, let’s try a more bulletproof float:left instead. It allows you to put block side-by-side at once, but it also sets the width 0 to their parent block so that they cannot be centered properly. To solve this drawback you should implement a fallback for display block in older browsers via a hasLayout property used under the hood of rendering engines. This construction allows us to mimic an inline-block within IE8-, * sign affects only those browsers and zoom sets the hasLayout to true. 3. Which actions may cause a reflow in a browser? This is one of my favorites because first of all it checks if a candidate has ever heard about a reflow, and if he has, most likely he also knows what a repaint is. So reflow is an action which a browser performs in order to know how the elements you described in your html should be placed on the page according to your screen - they are basically geometrical calculations. There are several ways of causing a reflow and you should first of all know the ways of forcing it, which may seem harmless on the first glance: clientHeight, clientLeft, clientTop, clientWidth, focus(), offsetWidth, outerText, scrollByLines(), scrollByPages(), scrollHeight, etc. This was just a small extract from all the methods, which could cause a reflow in your browser. 4. Describe the difference between fixed, fluid, responsive and adaptive design. Name the pros and cons. There are four main types of layout - fixed, fluid, responsive and adaptive. Fixed layout is static and has persistent size. It is very easy and cheap to create it, because you don’t need to think about mobile or tablet view but your app will look identical on every device. Fluid layout uses percentage values instead of pixels. It is more flexible than a fixed layout. It stretches and provides good user experience on different desktop screen sizes. But such layout is still bad for mobile and tablet users or contrariwise - larger screens such as iMacs. Responsive design uses a fluid grid system and CSS media queries to control a layout. It provides optimal user experience on all devices and is easily manageable. At the same time it requires more efforts and time as well as design. Adaptive design uses media queries to define device size and then depending on that information displays your page. Just like a responsive approach it provides a good user experience on multiple devices. Adaptive design implies that you use the same layout for different devices, but adapt it for each device. The bad news is that you will have problems with unique resolutions devices. Why do I find this question interesting to ask? First of all, you need to know if the person is familiar with modern CSS layouts as they are applied to any present-day web project. If fixed layout design is something well known and a person can guess this by name, then fluid, adaptive and responsive may sound like they are similar. 5. How to implement a menu with 5 items using flexbox? The first three items should float to the left, the other two - to the right. At first glance this seems very easy to do. In flexbox there’s a property called “align-self” for child elements. It allows you to override global alignment and make an element independent. But you will get stuck if you try using it - why? Flexbox has two axis - main (horizontal) and cross (vertical). The problem is that the “align-self” property works only for cross axis. That means an element can only be aligned vertically. So there are two possible ways to solve that. The first solution that comes to mind is to make parent wrappers for those elements you need to separate and apply “justify-content: space-between” for their parent. You’ll get something like this: This solution has some disadvantages. If you need two elements at the beginning of the menu and three at the end, you need to change your layout, delete an element from the first wrapper and move it to the second. I consider that it requires too many moves on your part for such a simple thing. So there is another way to implement that. You can use auto-margins to make elements independent on the main axis. In this case the last two elements will move to the right. They are still flexible and you have more control over them. If you need to change the number of elements floated to the right you should only change a number in your css code without affecting the HTML at all. This question requires deep knowledge of flexbox properties and its behavior, though it can show you if the candidate can think out of the box. 6. Create a tooltip for an element without affecting HTML code First, you should think about the UX purpose of a tooltip - it is some additional info shown while the pointer is placed over an element. It means that first off all you need to use is :hover pseudoclass. The easiest solution would be to add an element to the layout and show/display it on hover. But you will realize that you can only use CSS. To cope with this you need to use pseudo-elements such as :before or :after. They provide you a possibility to create a manageable element using only css. You can set the text for your tooltip in the CSS content property or, you can pass it to the attr() value of the same “content” property if you have it in the element's attribute. The decoration and positioning only depends on your imagination. 7. What is wrong with the following snippet? This question allows me to determine if a person has good knowledge of the CSS block system. It is a very important question, because the block system is as fundamental for CSS as an alphabet is for a language. There are two main types of elements - inline and block. Inline elements’ width depends on the inner content. Block elements take the full width until you define them a size and make them floating or define them as inline blocks. Also there is another not so obvious difference between these elements. According to the CSS box-model, each element has paddings and margins, both of which can be applied to any element, but they will affect only the left and right side of the inline element. In the example above we have a span element. It is displayed inline, so applying a margin or padding won’t affect its height. If an interviewee got stuck with the question, you can ask more specific questions to see if he will catch up. Can we reset the default behavior of an inline element? How? What will be shown if I will add padding:5px to an inline element? The questions described in this article are covering only CSS / layout part of frontend development, but they are great indicator in discovering whether a developer is really striving to know more in his domain.", "date": "2017-03-09"},

If a project is of light or medium complexity - the variety of possible technologies and frameworks may be huge and the choice is usually a matter of preference and experience. However, finding the best stack for a compound system consisting of several different applications - might be a challenge. For development purposes it would be ideal to use the same technology and programming language across all system parts. It is also essential to consider further development and maintenance after the first release, to think through how developers will \"live\" along the chosen technologies, resolve the issues and improve the project, how easily it will be to reach version 2.0, 3.0 and so on, and whether it will be possible to adapt the solution to some specific customer requirements. Our company developed a complex emergency system which comprises processing services, a desktop client and mobile applications for all major platforms. Certainly, the system of this kind has to be reliable and able to process high number of requests. Apart from that, it should surely store and manipulate lots of data, and provide the possibility to scale the services to reach necessary performance, and host them in the public and/or private cloud. Moreover, each service, depending on its tasks, should be started upon request or work 24/7 and respond with a minimal latency. Thus, required services should be hosted differently: some – on the web server, some – as independent applications. So, we had complex requirements for very different subprojects and we prefered using one platform that would gracefully cover everything and still give us flexibility to make changes when needed. Looking at technology trends, we've decided to settle on Microsoft .NET platform. Why? To answer this question let's take a closer look at main parts of the solution architecture. In our emergency system the information about an incident comes from dispatchers and the staff that use smartphones and special mobile devices. Dispatchers use the desktop client application, which displays the information about each active incident, builds charts, generates statistics and reports, provides access to all the data in the system. Dispatchers register new incidents through the rich user-friendly UI, see the current location of people on map and how far they are from the incident location. Microsoft .NET provides two main technologies for the desktop applications: WinForms and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The later is actually used by Microsoft itself in the majority of their products. Both of them are well-documented and well-tested frameworks, and are ideal for building rich and responsive UI applications. Moreover, there are a lot of framework and controls, based on WPF and WinForms. For our application we've used WPF and DevExpress controls which are extremely convenient when building complex client-side applications. Other staff use smartphones with our mobile client application for sending alerts, updating statuses and communicating with organization management. The Xamarin technology, actively supported by Microsoft, allowed our team to use the .NET Framework for developing one application for Windows Phone, iOS and Android operating systems at the same time. Our server side consists of Gateway, several processing and notification services. We host them in a private cloud. Actually, speaking about hosting of .NET services, it’s worth mentioning that there are many options available: at any moment we can migrate, for example, to such well-known clouds as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, if the product would need such step. After receiving a raw incident message Gateway service parses it and creates data structure ready for processing. The information about active incidents in our case is stored in the document database, because it's much easier to store temporary unstructured data in the non-relational schemaless database. On the contrary, all the data that is rarely changed and archive data about incidents are stored in the relational database. And of course, there are a lot of drivers and object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks for the .NET to work with almost all widely used databases: both, relational and document ones. In our solution we use MongoDB with their official .NET driver that nicely support language-integrated queries (LINQ) exclusively available only in .NET. And for SQL Server – NHibernate ORM. Initially, most of the services were implemented as RESTful: first, we were using the ServiceStack.NET, then we switched to the Web API. However, performance of HTTPS requests was too slow for us. Hopefully, there are options how to deal with the problem. In one or two weeks we have easily migrated all essential services to the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and now they communicate using the TCP protocol. The rest Web API services support Open Web Interface (OWIN) for .NET that means that it's possible to host each one wherever we need (on IIS, Nginx, self-hosted, etc.) depends on what tasks the service does. As a result, we have a working complex solution. It is easy to implement new features and improve the existing ones, because the .NET environment provides everything we need. There are a lot of libraries, frameworks, tools, IDEs, documentation available for the .NET. Thus, we are happy with our choice! Summing up, .NET is a mature well-designed and well-documented platform with a great support of community. Most of the technologies are open-source and free to use in commercial products. Currently, technologies from the .NET stack can be used not only on Windows infrastructure, but also on Linux, Mac, iOS, Android, and even on the embedded devices (using the .NET Micro Framework). In other words, .NET becomes a great solution for almost all kinds of projects you can imagine!", "date": "2017-02-09"},

New circumstances make new industry leaders emerge and new niches grow while older tech trends and markets are losing importance. For example some Southeastern Asian countries quickly became mature IT industry players despite the post-war and post-colonialism hardships; while the worldwide coal industry, once the leading source of energy, is now mostly thriving on subsidies. Today we will take a look at a country for which both coal and IT industries are areas of key importance. Having the 2 nd (following Russia) biggest territory in Europe, Ukraine potentially could have become a tough challenger in the continent’s markets. By the time of gaining independence, it was a powerful agricultural and industrial cluster in the former USSR. Besides the aforementioned coal industry (back then, its importance was much higher), the country owned numerous plants and factories belonging to steel, weaponry & heavy machinery manufacturing, chemistry, space & aircraft engineering and many other branches. Most of them are located in big cities such as Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, Kharkov, Donetsk, Nikolaev, Zaporozhye etc. Of course, all those complex organizations constantly demanded hundreds of qualified engineers. Consequently, all major cities of the country had several big educational institutions with strong orientation towards main industrial branches. Ukrainian system of higher education held leading positions compared to most of other members of the former USSR. During the 90s – 2000s it faced significant difficulties yet managed to keep its quality and popularity high enough. In 2012 Ukraine got the best rank in Eastern Europe according to a research of higher education in various countries. Currently Ukraine has more than 800 universities offering graduation and post-graduation programs. They operate in terms of the Bologna process; and most of them maintain profound studying of most widespread European languages such as English, German, French, Spanish etc. The early 90s saw Ukraine face a number of serious challenges, along with most of other Central & Eastern Europe. Such countries as Czech Republic or Poland being Warsaw Pact members were dependent upon Soviet Union, politically and economically; so after its collapse they had to undergo significant reforms. Consequently, national industries often suffered – old supply chains were broken while conquering Western European markets was hardly possible. Ukraine being a core Union’s part had even more difficult problems to overcome. The Union’s industry was much centralized due to the specifics of planned economy; so even its major part loses its efficiency after becoming ‘independent’. It was too difficult for Ukraine to maintain its industry to the full extent. During the next decade many plants, factories and mines got closed. As a result the country had a numerous tech workforce which could not implement its skills. Most evident solution for such people was reorientation; they had to find a new niche where they could use their knowledge best. Right at the same time the software industry grew rapidly all over the world; and it badly needed more working hands. Two big factors influenced the growth of IT in 1990s. First, personal computers became a common household element in most countries. Second, the World Wide Web came to offices and households. As a result, new consumer trends emerged, new types of services quickly appeared; and eventually new markets with immense potential lay open before the industry players. Then came the Dotcom era, the social networks, blogospheres, mobile solutions etc. Despite any crises, the world software industry continued to grow; and its peak is not reached yet. Experts anticipate significant IT skills shortage in 2014 because “ the demand for tech and software talent is exploding ”. Fresh workforce was often found in countries with less developed economy, with people either employed directly or via outsourcing schemas. Eastern & Central European countries became mature IT skills providers by 2000s. A recent research published by a consulting company Tholons pours some light on the situation. In the list of world’s most popular IT outsourcing destinations Eastern Europe is in the Top 10 (Krakow, Poland taking the 10 th place); and most of local cities present in the list can boast the positive growth compared to the previous year. Ukraine owns two entries in it - #55 for Kyiv and #89 for Lviv (both with positive dynamics as well). And hopefully its positions will become even better eventually. IT sector continues gaining popularity in Ukraine. Each year more and more students choose to master in Computer Science and Software Development, eager to participate in interesting projects or to work on their own start-ups. Steady migration to the IT segment goes from other areas such as Math or Applied Math (which traditionally were highly developed in Soviet times); from Telecommunications, Industrial Automation etc. So isn’t it a good time to check what outsourcing services you can get here?", "date": "2017-02-09"},

Introduction Beginning with this article I am going to start a set of articles about different things in C++ which can confuse and challenge some junior programmers or be interesting for getting a deeper knowledge about this language. I will try to tell everything in a clear and comprehensible way. Articles will contain a lot C++ code with lots of comments. I usually use GCC compiler with enabled C++11 standard on Linux machine, in case of other environment, I will mention this. My first message is aimed at the first target group who usually don't deal well with the title. My goal is to describe difference between these fundamental entities and make some kind of guide how to use them with the Force. So what kind of beasts pointers and references are? or some kind of history History comes first. Pointers are legacy from C-times. I don't use this phrase in negative sense, because it is a very useful acquisition. Pointers provide random access in memory of computer. This means that pointer is an address in the memory. What you can get by this address? Usually it will be your variables or set of variables (arrays). References appeared in C++ when there was an issue with overloading operators which return type for other operations, such as []. You must remember this correct overloading, but just for one moment let’s think that C++ doesn't have references. It would be like this: and everything is great until you try to assign returned value: OK, then you can write something like this with pointers: and it works in the following way: but when you see this, you think \"uugh, it is ugly!\". We are forced to use dereference operator *. Also it collapses encapsulation of class, because we get raw pointer and nobody forbids to use it and modify any values in its memory space. We can do such tricks: very bad boy, very bad... So there is a typical situation where we need good l-value for operator [] which we can change without collapsing encapsulation of the class. References are what we need. Meet: Perfect! It works, it is elegant and it doesn't hurt anybody, but we still don't know what reference is. Actually it is dereferenced constant pointer. That means we still get object by address, we can modify object, but address itself can't be modified. In simple words it is a nice way to hide ugly constructions with pointers and their dereference operator from us. Main difference or understand everything Lets see how we create pointers for different purpose: in order of appearance: (1.1) We use operator new to create integer object whose value is 10 and we must use operator delete to free it (1.5) (1.2) We use operator new [] to create a set of integer objects. Set has size 1 and single object has value 10. In such cases do not forget to free memory with operator delete [] (1.6) (1.3) We use operator & which takes address of the variable (do not muddle it with declaration of reference!). We don't free this pointer, because it is addressed to variable on stack which destroys when performing of code is gone out of scope. (1.4) We address pointer on nullptr which means that nothing was allocated and there is nothing to free. There is just silence and nirvana. Let’s see how we create references Actually (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3) are very similar, but used in different context. We get reference on already existing variable: (2.1) is local variable; (2.2) is argument of function which is pointer; (2.3) is argument of function passed by value. If you take a look at (1.4) and (2.*) little bit more, than you get first difference between pointers and references: references have to be addressed somewhere, but pointers aren’t. It means following code doesn't compile: but this does: OK you can ask about such case: I want to ask counter question – who is your doctor? Never act like this and you will be blessed. It isn't an issue of reference. It is an issue of dereferencing of nullptr, because by standard this is undefined behavior . Any compiler doesn't guarantee correct work here. Take a look at (1.2) and (2.*) again. See? - References is addressed to single object. Next: references can't be addressed to other object after its creation. Following code proves it: If you return to implementation of operator [] which returns pointer, you may understand: references don't support address arithmetic. You will never see code with references which use operator +, operator -, operator – or operator ++ for changing address. Only pointers can do this and that's why C or C++ is usually called low level language when it comes to memory management. When do we usually use them with Force? or typical use cases For what purpose pointer can be used: For what purpose reference can be used: And last one, don't worry - polymorphism works well on both entities. Conclusion That's all what I wanted to say. There are some phrases which make up a summary of the article: For source code you can visit this github repository .", "date": "2017-02-09"},

Six month of life spent learning plenty of cool stuff you are passionate about, evolving and becoming one step closer to be a ninja! So this is an article about what I’ve learnt with Binary Studio. If you want something GO for IT! I was in the middle of studying for master degree when I first heard about Binary Studio. They announced an educational project Academy for students interested in programming with emphasis on .NET technologies. At the time I was very interested in C# and .NET so it was the perfect timing. I got lighted up immediately by the idea of participating in such an interesting event. Competition was pretty strong with a large number of participants. I wasn’t sure that I had enough experience and knowledge but I decided to put as many efforts into preparing for academy entry tests as possible and the result didn’t disappoint me. Lots of people don’t try because of the fear to fail. But the truth is you lose nothing by trying. By not trying you lose the opportunity to succeed. I remind it to myself every time I have doubts and it really works. Importance of practice and communication: Academy was two months of concentrated hard work and learning lots of technologies used for web development. Academy makes strong emphasis on real commercial programming, by offering students not only theoretical knowledge, but also opportunity to practice in real projects. During two months of academy I improved my knowledge in C#, .NET, OOP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and web development in general. It was hell of a pace! But what I appreciate the most is the opportunity to work as part of the team. In university you rarely work in teams because majority of projects are individual.  But in academy we had a group of programmers, working together on achieving one goal. This motivates you a lot! Communication with other programmers, especially the more experienced ones, makes you work harder and helps to evolve as a developer. Programming in a commercial company: Right after academy I received a job offer and started working as a .NET software developer. My first project was development of cross-platform mobile application in a team of more experienced developers. Needless to say that I was excited by opportunity to learn from them. Right now it’s been already six months since I started working on this project. During this time I’ve learnt a lot about mobile and commercial development, got understanding what it’s like to work in a big company. Also I’ve learnt another important aspect of software development - planning. I’m talking about agile software methodologies here. It’s a very powerful tool that helps efficiently distribute your time resources in order to be more productive. Also it inspired me to try GTD – cool time-management method that helps you free your brain from processing all the important information at once. Getting Things Done teaches to think about things important right now only. Overall I enjoy my experience here at Binary. Binary Studio has very good conditions for working and growing due to positive and friendly atmosphere created by easygoing, inspirational, open-minded people working here. Summary: Binary Studio gave me a good start of my career as a software developer. Thanks to them I am motivated to: · Set new goals and not to be afraid of putting efforts into achieving them. · Pay more attention to communication and practicing in the field of computer programming. · Strive to constant growth and evolution as a software developer. All great achievements start with small steps. I stepped forward, so should you!

Girls don't understand us, “gopniks” (chavs) dread to have a deal with us. We are in the midst of rumors and anecdotes. But we still stick to our styles. But who are we? We are programmers. If you are already up to buy cheeses for 500 UAH and make great money without any visible labor, then I am, glad for you. But in the case this article is not for you. Because here we will focus on young Padawans of computer science and their formation on the difficult Jedi way. One of the main questions that people who want to step into IT industry are interested in- whether I need computer science higher education? My answer is - yes. I fully agree that our education system is not perfect. But it is not supposed to give you 100% of knowledge. In my case, the university gave me about 10 %, other 40% is self-education, another 50 - Binary Studio Academy. We will talk about it later. University became my starting point, and who knows where I would be now without getting there. Basics of algorithms, OOP, software engineering and network programming, agile, mobile and web development. Such \"advanced\" knowledge I received from my higher school. But even if you came from Faculty of Economics when realized that you couldn’t imagine your life without computers, or just you're too lazy to wipe the chairs in the state-owned university, you have a chance to step in IT. Note: Computer specialty was only a trick, an attempt to circumvent the parent’s prohibitions to spend more time at the computer. As you can see from my personal statistics self-education is a way to success. It doesn’t matter whether you're an intern or bearded Senior, IT sphere doesn’t love the one who saves his teeth and doesn’t chew few granites for dinner. IT - means something new every day. And if you are not ready to studying whole life – someone will overtake you. But first you need to figure out what language you want to start with. Please, remember that programming language -  is a tool, but you have to master it perfectly . I began to code using C++ later tried C#, now I code in  JavaScript and Python. Programmer is a state of soul (just like a  Blondie), during your career you will try a lot of programming languages. But firstly I advise you to choose just one to start with. I think C# will be the best choice. Why? Great support, intuitive C-like syntax and a huge amount of useful functionality out of the box. It helps beginners quickly become a master in the difficult world of IT. As I mentioned above, the basic for young professionals is to read a lot. Most students get lost in the abundance of sources that are available to them. Therefore, I would like to highlight a few of them, which, in my opinion, you can and should pay attention to. 1. Habrahabr One of the best Russian IT communities. And if you don’t know about it just stop everything (except reading this article), and open your browser. Here you can find information about everything that is related to software development, interesting news from the world of IT and more. Habrahabr - is alive a self-governing community. Your rating is controlled by other users. Wrote a good article, left an interesting review - get a cookie. Made some bad things – get penalty. It's simple. 2. Eric Freeman and Elizabeth Freeman - Design Patterns A great book about design patterns with an incredible manner of presentation. All examples are based on actual processes of life. The best thing I've ever read about patterns. http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do 3. Stoyan Stefanov - JavaScript The book for JS beginners who are familiar with any of the C-like languages. Detailed description of language structure and basic designs, working with DOM, examples of patterns implementation on JavaScript. Excellent book from O'Relly. http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do 4. J. Richter - CLR via C # (4th Edition) The “must-read” book for C# beginners.  Jeffrey Richter became a well-known figure in the computer world, IT specialist, author of the coolest books and articles about Net framework's and C# language. The book describes in detail the structure of the .Net platform, especially its implementation, compile order, build libraries, packages and applications. The book is huge (about 800 pages), but after reading it you will immediately become familiar with the .Net world. 5. Paulo Coehlo Neither the author nor his work requires reporting. A wonderful book about motivation J. Well, I would also like to say some words about Binary Studio Academy. It was the most incredible two months of my life! Have you ever thought that you can enjoy the haste, sleepless nights and whole days coding, tons read articles and studied material? No? You just haven’t been here. You will not believe, but we literally fought for a chance  to take a particular task. Everyone tried to read, understand, and implement it in working code as much as possible. For 2 months, we plunged into the world of real development: communication with customers, system design, day (and not only) phoned discussing enjoying of the first working version and bitterness of failed release. During the first two weeks, we have learned more new words and concepts than abusive words in the childhood. We were in the prostration from a misunderstanding of what is happening, but every day loved it more and more. You just spend your days working, and you want to do it. It’s difficult to describe, but the effect is impressive - you gain invaluable experience from cool coaches, get into teamwork and learn to independently find and use the right material. Programmer is a way of life. A whole slew of interesting, non-trivial tasks, hangouts and events, travel and business trips abroad, communicating with aliens and more. If you think that this is what you need if you're willing to fight obesity and your laziness, to learn something new every day - you're on the right way. Inspired? Get started today and maybe tomorrow you will become a part of the world IT, a part of the Academy, a part of the Binary Studio star team. Kirill started programming career with .Net, but later fell in love with JavaScript. He is vocal about his software ideas and enthusiastically tackles every assignment.

Also thanks to @msemenistyi who proposed to look deeper in Node.js. And also thanks to Okean Elzy for the great music atmosphere that accompanied the whole process. So what is the audience of this article? I think it'll be helpful for people who started learning server side programming using Node.js like me :), for people who got acquainted at least a bit with Node and NPM and for others who partially use js. I'm not a JS-guru but the challenge is accepted. Let's start. Make sure you have the latest node and nmp installed. We're going to write simple as door TODO application using next js technologies: · Express.js - web application framework for Node. (It's like Zend for PHP). · Sequelize - ORM for Node environment (Well known analogs for PHP are Eloquent and Doctrine ). · PostgreSQL - as storage engine. To be honest we will modify for our needs turorial from Sequelize website . So what is the architecture of our app like? We will delegate it to manipulate TODO instances via CRUD . That's why we need to create database in Postgres and create there a table in order to store described instances. If you haven't yet installed postgresql server,please, install it. There is an example below: If you are new to PostgreSQL you can take a look at this tutorial . Here serial is analog to MySQL's autoincrement and varying char is the same as VARCHAR(?). And some forewords about UI. Our app will have next UI: Here we will submit new items from sibling input via 'Add' button and connected input to it. When new item appears it appends to list as read-only input which will be activated by double clicking on them. Now we can switch to writing an application. First of all let's create app folder and install express.js via npm. Then ask express to create skeleton app structure which we're going to modify later. For doing this you need to run following commands in your command line: After that we will receive following project structure: You're able to run Express skeleton app using node app.js and see result by entering localhost: 3000 in your browser's address bar. In order to install PostgresSQL db connector and Sequelize, please, run following commands: --save option instructs NPM to include the package inside of the dependencies section of your package.json automatically. Let's write main app file app.js . Here we require all necessary dependency modules, create express app and define server variables like port, template render engine etc.: Then map routes to controller’s actions. Express has special methods for handling HTTP requests. The similar routing way you can find in PHP framework Laravel . And finally make db connection and create server. Next step: we create models loader models/index.js . The purpose of this file is to collect all models modules in db variable in order to provide access to them in other modules (e.g controllers aka routes) of our application. Actually I forked this module from tutorial and left it \"as is\". But there is one important thing like db connection. It's not so complicated. We just provide db credentials and specify dialect. FYI Sequelize is able to work against MySQL, SQlite and MariaDB too. Below is an example of db connection: Our next point is Todo model definition via Sequalize interface. Due to Sequelize ability of creation db schema via migrations on first app run let's disable some options like paranoid mode which allows creating additional timestamp fields (createdAt, updatedAt). Also we are able to specify actual table name. As for DataTypes we will use only STRING in our simple example. The other types you can find at Sequalize documentation page . Now we are closer to controllers (routes) checkpoint. In our app we will have two of them: · index.js - which handles our index page. On this page we will render main layout and all todo items; · todo.js - which methods reflect our actions on todo items. Controller index.js will helps us retrieve all TODO items and render them via Node template engine - Jade Sequelize provides different kinds of finders like find, findAll, findOrCreate. Template index.jade is the main content block for layout.jade. In index.jade we're going to render TODO item list, new TODO input and action button. In layout.jade we define our common html page markup, add stylesheets, specify additional js libraries like jQuery and do other necessary things.  On application running via node app.js all jade templates will be compiled in html ones. Examples of layout.jade and index.jade are placed below: Usually passed template's variables have simple access to them and jade is not an exception. Unfortunately it's not a jade tutorial. For more information, please, read Jade's reference . Let's see todo.js controller. The main point here is request handlers. For each of them we do some manipulations with database. In order to create new install of Todo we call Sequelize's create method and specified attribute text which we can retrieve from requests bo", "date": "2017-02-09"},

Later Clang has been updated with specialized facilities to process source files and even to modify them. As it's now, Clang can be used to implement tools for processing code written in C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ relatively easily. With it anyone can write tools for code processing with quite little amount of effort. The hard part is to start writing such tools as it's easy to get lost in lots of headers and libraries supplied with LLVM and Clang. Hence the main idea behind these series of articles: give one enough knowledge to be able to use Clang for writing tools. To achieve the goal, we'll look at examples of building Clang-tools from scratch. There will also be referenced materials that are recommended to read/watch/consult as using Clang and LLVM is already documented in many sources. Although there are plenty of resources on Clang, most of them have two issues: · there are more or less out of date (because of quite high pace of development and breaking changes from time to time); · some of covered examples are too artificial. That's why we're going to build a small set of tools some of which might not be self contained, but nevertheless should be usable in real life. Process of building such tools will shed light on different parts of Clang, which will help construct a better image of what it is and in what ways it can be used. Here are some details of my working environment to help solve possible issues with initial setup (see below). · GNU/Linux operating system · GCC version 4.8.1 · LLVM from 11.03.2014 built with GCC: · Clang from 11.03.2014 built with GCC: · cmake version 2.8.8 · ninja version 1.4.0 · everything is built with GCC To get started one needs to have a working build of LLVM and Clang. This is not a subject of this writing and there is already a good tutorial on this (read notes below before following instructions in the tutorial): Tutorial for building tools using LibTooling and LibASTMatchers It seems to be a bit out of date, so here are some additional moments to consider: 1. Modern versions of cmake are built with ninja support, so good chances that there is no need to recompile it, check it by running: 2. I suggest enabling generation of documentation with Doxygen. For this one needs to set the following ccmakeoptions to YES before starting the build (see a small hint on using ccmakebelow): - CLANG_INCLUDE_DOC - LLVM_BUILD_DOCS - LLVM_INCLUDE_DOCS This way you'll be sure that you're referring to the correct version of documentation while writing your tools. You might want to set LLVM_BUILD_DOCS to OFFonce everything is built, it won't delete generated documentation, but will reduce time of compilation when build is started by ninjacommand with no arguments. 3. It's said that all tests should pass. Current version of tests display messages about expected failed tests, that seems to be OK. 4. If you decide to rebuilt Clang with itself don't forget to setup CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER as well as CMAKE_C_COMPILER (use full path to clang executable for it). Actually recompiling with Clang is optional, no need to waste time on that. 5. In step 1 there is a command: Which should be: ccmake hint: use arrow keys to navigate in terminal interface, “j”/“k” doesn't work there, but searching with “/” works. Once you're done with that tutorial, you should feel like knowing a lot of new stuff about it, still not being 100% sure that you able to write your own tool. It's advised to watch Introduction to the Clang AST now. Actually the order can be reversed (watch the video first), but as Manuel Klimek (the guy in the video) describes more advanced topics, it makes sense to do basic tutorial first. Now, having some background, we can start creating our small, but useful tool. Our goal is to analyse source files to find postfix increment and decrement operators in the last part of for-loop statements. The drawback of using postfix operator is that it can lead to performance penalty in some cases. As you probably know, postfix operator differs from prefix one in creating one extra object, which normally is not optimized. It's almost free for primitive types and can be free when it goes about iterators from library provided along with a compiler, but in general it's a good practice to use postfix increment/decrement operators only when you have a reason to do so. There is already a plenty of tools that can detect misuse of postfix operators, but such warnings can get lost in output of mature static analyzers and be just skipped by a developer. This tool we'll do just that so skipping such warnings would be a stupid thing to do. This is just a good programming style to use postfix operators, so let's write a tool that ensures correctness of for-loops and learn more about Clang's AST at the same time. By the way, we'll name the tool \"for-postfix\" (not to be confused with mail transfer agent ). See \"Additional resources\" section below for a link to repository containing ready to use tool. History of commits is quite clear, so one can examine commits one by one while reading the article. Note, I go in detail in this section just to repeat what you have learnt from the tutorial, skip this part if you feel like you don't need to repeat anything. Just as in \"Tutorial for building tools using LibTooling and LibASTMatchers\" referenced above, we're going to use LibTooling and ASTMatchers . There is also RecursiveASTVisitor , but it's now superseded by ASTMatchers. To get started go to llvm/tools/clang/tools/extra/directory and create a subdirectory called for-postfix. Navigate to new directory and create CMakeLists.txt containing: Another file that needs to be created is for-postfix.cpp. For now let's put a dummy code there: Add add_subdirectory (for-postfix) line at the end of the llvm/tools/clang/tools/extra/CMakeLists.txt, so that our tool is built with LLVM/Clang. Now I suggest you to go into your build/directory and run ninja  for-postfix just to make sure the configuration is correct. If it is, you'll find an executable build/bin/for-postfix that does nothing when it's run. Now let's write a skeleton of the tool (I give this as it is because you should already know basics of this kind of stuff): This should compile and link fine. By the way, notice unusual const in front of argv parameter declaration, this is needed to satisfy prototype of CommonOptionsParser constructor . Finally we're ready to start matching things we're interested in. Our first matcher will match increment operators, both prefix and postfix: Above piece of code should be self-explaining, but notice where bind method is called. It can be called on objects that correspond to real AST nodes, like for-statements (result of forStmt) and operators (result of calling unaryOperator), but can't be called on something that just examines properties of AST nodes (like hasIncrement or hasOperatorName). To proceed further we need one more entity, MatchFinder's callback handler: Also don't forget to include <iostream> before compiling. You should be familiar with the idea behind this code: it tries to extract unary operator node named op and dumps it on the screen when succeed. Let's create our helper and use it to add our matcher in the main function: At this point running our tool over this example file: Should output both i++ and ++i like this (ignore addresses): Let's filter out the second match in our helper. Just surround dumping code with: What we have now is not capable of handling decrement operator. To fix that, simplify the matcher to remove operator name check (note name change): Note that there was one condition, which is now removed, while actually one can use many conditions separated by commas. We're not removing the check completely, just moving it to the MatchHelper, where op->isPostfix() condition needs to be replaced with: That's it for builtin operators. This example uses postfix increment operator, but our for-postfix is not able to find it yet: Our matcher could look like this: This one is too specific and requires its clone to match decrement operator (couldn't find a way to implement match chooser, something like OR operator). It also has two interesting properties: · operatorCallExpr got two conditions that are ANDed with each other; · argumentCountIs is used to match postfix operator, here first argument is this and the second one is useless int to make overloading of postfix operators possible. Let's throw away matching of operator name and do this in MatchHelper later: Now we need to update MatchHelper a bit to handle overloaded operators, which it won't match now as CallExpr doesn't subclass UnaryOperator: Where printOut contains two lines from above that dump operator nodes. As you can see matching specific operators is quite easy. The crucial part in this case is to use right type of node. Regular CallExpr won't let us to check for operator type, CXXOperatorCallExpr is needed instead. Now let's register new matcher in MatchFinder: Note that by adding multiple matchers to match finder one can match different things in one traverse through AST. We're almost done. Current way of printing out nodes is not readable, it would be better to print path to source file and line number of the match. First of all we need to include more headers and add one more using directive: Then update printOut method: This snippet outputs match in the following format: Example output (with truncated paths): It's alike output of Unix grep command (with -F and -n switches) and can be accepted by many other tools out there, e.g. one can store output of the tool to a file and open it in Vim to navigate through errors and edit them like this: This tool can already be used in real projects to find misuse of postfix operators. · The Design of LLVM by Chris Lattner, the primary author of the LLVM and related projects, such as the Clang compiler. · Collection of Clang tutorials . · GitHub repository with for-postfix tool .", "date": "2017-02-09"},

Extended talk about references and pointers Introduction This topic is continuing my previous article . I am going to make additional speech about reference and a little bit about pointers, because I have left behind some issues. Also my previous article wasn't small, however it didn't fit all information. Now I will talk about some missed explanation examples, reference as return value or argument for function\\method, overriding of operator & and covariation in C++. Extra explanation of pointers vs. references examples or this song is nice, let's play it again If you remember, in the previous article I said that reference point to a single object and pointer can point to  whole array of objects (in common sense, including primitive types). But I didn't say that reference can't point to another reference contrary to pointers. This capability of pointers is very useful. For example I think everybody knows that matrix in mathematics and pointers suit well on low level. See: So in code above we created matrix with dimensions 3x3, which is represented as pointer to array of pointers to integer arrays. To access each item of the matrix we can use operator []. See how we can print out the matrix: And to prevent leaks you have to release such matrix correctly: I use delete[] operator every time because we used operator new[] for allocation. Remember the rule: what was allocated with new[] has to be release with delete[]. As for references you can't make a reference to reference: Actually there is C++11 syntax for r-value reference. I won't describe this now because this is a subject for another article, but if you want, you can look it up on the Internet. Just remember your compiler won't compile it for the purpose you want, but actually I don't know such purposes. Even more - don't think about it. It is a taboo, just like trying to create an array of references: One more difference between pointers and references is a result of applying “address of” operator (“&”). Reference has the same address as the object it points to, but pointer doesn't: Output in console will be different every time, but for example for me it printed out: Address of value and reference is the same, which doesn't hold for pointers as I said earlier. In the last two cases you see the same address as value address because via &*ptr and ptr we get direct access to address of an object. Keep value alive or dead man doesn't walk As you probably know local variables are allocated on stack. What will happen if one returns reference to such variable from a function\\method? It is a horrible story, because call side of the function\\method gets reference to dead object because all variables on a stack are released when their scope ends. So the following code causes segmentation fault (or not, the behavior is undefined): We still can read some values from std::vector<int>&, because reference has the object address and nobody cares whether it is alive or not. Compiler doesn't care too and puts call of std::vector<T>::operator [] which therefore performs as usually and reads something from the released memory. On std::vector<T>::push_back() we might get segmentation fault, because called function tries to work with internal resources which don't exist anymore. So there is a hidden issue which can't be found immediately if you don't know about such cases or don't worry about compile warnings. The last one is very bad, dude. If you want to return something by reference, commonly it may take place with fields of class and with usage of const modifier, which is still not considered to be a good practice. On the other hand, one can safely return reference to statically allocated object, which is widely used to control time and order of creation of such objects. This is what I wanted to say about reference as return value, lets proceed with reference as input arguments. Imagine that you have such function: If you use it like this: everything is good until you pass value 10 directly to function, in which case you'll get compile error: Here 10 is r-value and as temporary object can be passed only by value, in our case compiler doesn't find function with such interface. If you change type argument from int& to int it will work, but there is a way to bind this r-value object. If you use const modifier for int& type it will compile and work: This way it keeps 10 temporary alive and you can work with such object through constant operations. In our case it is readable. So if you don't change referenced argument it is a good practice to pass it with const modifier. You can use the similar trick for keeping r-value temporary alive by binding it to a local variable which is constant reference. See code: Here constant reference extends lifetime of temporary object until it goes from scope. So keep in mind that constant reference is your good friend. Overriding operators and reference or a little hack in the name of goodnes s Everybody knows that you can override operators in C++. Operator &, obtaining address of class instance, can be overridden too. It can be necessary when some instance is wrapped by proxy class, but for some purpose instance of proxy class must return address of wrapped instance. The code looks like following: For me it printed something like this: As you can see it has printed the same addresses as for instance of class and as for its field, which I used like wrapped instance. But what can you do if you want to know real address of proxy class? Of course you can return it by special method: It printed for me: This is the real address of proxy class, but it isn't cool to write such a method every time for every class. So there is std::addressof() helper function from <memory> header in blessed C++11. See: But it can't be suitable for all folks, because what to do if your compiler doesn't support C++11 or has only partial support? And how to do it cross-platform? reinterpret_cast<T> hurries to help! Check out such hack: See? reinterpret_cast<T> helps us to cast some reference to constant reference of unsigned char and cast it back to pointer type. In such a way pointer points to real address of instance and template function provides it for every type. Return type covariation or partly covariance First of all lets define covariance. It is support of subtyping for inherited classes. For example if we have such inherited classes: Covariance for such classes must guarantee that std::vector<CProgrammer> is subtype of std::vector<Human>. Here covariance means that std::vector<T> saves inheritance. So just a second ago you have read what C++ doesn't support. Templates don't provide it. They are invariant, because it will destroy type control. However good news - C++ supports covariant return types via pointers and references. It means that you can change return type when overriding virtual methods. In such case types are covariant. Here is an example of overriding with different return type through pointers: If you run such code: You will get in output: Same is true for references, but you can't do it with returning by value. It causes compile errors. Such feature is used for implementing virtual constructor idiom and can be useful in other cases. Conclusion In this article I have written about some differences between references and pointers that were left out in my previous article . Also I have shown examples of keeping r-value alive by constant reference, underlined issue with returning reference to variable which is allocated on stack. As well I have described how to get address of class instance which has overloaded operator &. Finally we reviewed covariation of return type in C++. As usual you can find examples of code in my repository on Github .", "date": "2017-02-09"},

And of course what changes should ITO industry of Ukrine expect. Leaders of the market all agree  that it's quite difficult to speak about growth this spring after Maidan Revolution in winter and Russia occupating Crimea now. We all understand that image of our own country has been damaged significantly by all the cruel recent events, which would of course decrease the level of trust to Ukraine as an ITO dstination across the globe. However the most important pitch we got this year is that IT industry is the moving locomotive of Ukraine's Economy and our government understands it really well, moreover they say they are ready to invest into development of IT education. The minister of economy Pavlo Sheremeta understands the value that growing ukraine's IT talents will bring to the country: new businesses, healthy cashflow, international exposure, taxes filing in govermental budgets etc. The most active companies are getting together  in order to perform various educational initiatives starting from school level. That said we are here to populate the proffession of software engineers, to increase the number of applicants to IT faculties and improve the quality of the education they get, to bring our country forward, to tune Ukraine's economy with IT ahead. Binary Studio is not going to stay aside the initiatives and is creating a series of tutorials for entry level developers, the materials will of course be available for free. Of course this summer we are going to invite some of the best students of Donetsk Region to our own educational program IT Academy and train the students in real lfe teams, on real pojects.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "how-to-become-a-web-programmer", "author": ["Nikita Semenistyi"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/04/23/how-to-become-a-web-programmer/", "abstract": "Web Development is one of the most popular categories of programming today, as most entertainment and business applications complete the transition to the web, and at the same time, many products and projects want to have information represented on the Web exclusively. 1. How did you decide on the programming language and how successful you consider this choice now? While studying at university, I knew very little about web programming. In my understanding, it was the html layout with tables and a few tags (b, a, i, u). To be honest, for all the time working I used these tags probably less than 10 times. In the end, I chose a supervisor who specialized in web development and made one small project that helped me get to wholesale throw pillows JavaScript and, of course , jQuery. On the server side, the choice was obvious for a person who heard very little about web development - PHP. This was my experience I wish not to remember, but nevertheless it was true. Anyway, from the first days I was writing mainly in JS and I'm very glad that fate brought me to it because my familiarity with it coincided with the active promotion of Node.Js and I like the current state of it both on the server and on the client side of JS development, and perspectives that will be opened with the adoption of new language standards. 2. How important is computer education? All the time while studying at university (DonNTU) I thought it was rather futile exercise than one that may eventually bring me necessary knowledge. Frankly, I still do not completely like the quality and integrity of the knowledge acquired at the university, but during my work, I grew sure that the knowledge obtained at university becomes very important in the critical moments when the task requires deviate a little from the simplest solutions. Thus, in my opinion, having a higher computer education is certainly a plus for the programmer, because it gives him the basis for building the next level of knowledge with understanding the mechanisms of each of the elements of the process. 3. How did Binary Studio Academy affect your becoming a programmer? For me, the Academy was a turning point in my professional life when I began to understand the real shape of commercial programming and teamwork. Pretty often the main goal in university was frequently to find a solution and tutors checked the result only. The academy also held regular code-review and the coaches helped us to find the right solutions for a given task. I believe that such a practice would help improve university education too. 4. What is the key point of success for beginners? The constant desire to get better and better is the key tip from me to beginners. I think budding professionals are obliged to devote not only work time, but also the most of free time studying technology, reading books, articles, watching webinars and finding solutions for different tasks. Among other things, it is important to have a seasoned developer by your side to help you save the time spent studying the problem, which is open-and-shut for him. He can lay the foundation for the project and give architectural advice to the beginner. 5. What book do you think is a must read every every self-respecting programmer? What other resources do you recommend? I believe that any programmer should be constantly learning and follow modern technology standards of their language and the web in general. Book GoF \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns ) is an indispensable source of knowledge about design patterns assisting to help find the best solutions and to communicate within a common terminology with other developers. Addy Osmani \"Learning JavaScript Design Patterns\" ( http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/ ) is a good application of the majority of the patterns in JavaScript language. David Flanagan \"Javascript: The Definitive Guide\" is a book that has helped me to dive into the syntax of the language and the best practices of it. Axel Rauschmayer \"Speaking JavaScript\" ( http://speakingjs.com/ ). In truth, I have not read this book, but have so much respect for the author, that I recommend it to you. In addition to books, I regularly read many blogs of such reputable developers like Addy Osmani, Paul Irish, Ilya Grigorik, Steve Souders, Ariya Hidayat, Axel Rauschmayer. If you subscribe to them on Twitter or Google+, you can track releases of their new posts. The resources like Reddit ( http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript , http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/ ) or EchoJs ( http://www.echojs.com/ ) offer quality selection of new in web development. 6. What distinguishes the class from the average programmer? In my opinion, class programmer distinguishes the perpetual search for better solutions, the most beautiful and productive solutions. Class programmer always keeps pace of the times and knows new standards not only of his language, but also the entire ecosystem with which it is associated. Cool programmer is not married to a single technology, but is open to new, knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each of the possible approaches. Among other things, I think a really cool programmer must be familiar with algorithms and data structures. He must understand the mechanisms of functioning of his platform of choice at the level of memory usage and CPU resources. I can’t say that I know all of this, but that's the goal of being classy, ​​which can’t be achieved in a day or a year, but that requires constant self improvement. 7. Why is it cool to be a programmer? Most recently, it came to my mind that the programmers – are the happiest people because they do exactly what most of them strive to since childhood. In a broad sense, we are creative people and if we apply our knowledge properly, we have a chance to make the world better. Programmers occupy honorary degree in the engineer society in Ukraine, representing a true middle class, which forms the elite of the nation.

TDD is - an approach, which basically means writing module tests for application. The tests are created before the code is written, and this is an obstacle for some developers, because testing something non-existent is difficult. BDD is development technic that is widely used in Agile along with TDD. It is based on behavioral system’s aspects, while TDD is based on implementation aspects. While using the BDD we reduce to minimum possibility of misunderstanding among users, developers and business-analytics. We can achieve this by creating Executable Scenarios (scenarios described in the specifications are translated into executable tests). BDD is neither new nor revolutionary, it is just a farther evolution of TDD-approach, where instead of “ test ” we use “ must ” word. Leaving words aside, we can expect using term “must” more naturally than “test” in implementation process. If we think in terms of “ functionality ”, this would lead us to classes, written for specification validation and could be the efficient implementation instrument. Let’s go back to UserStory template. Its classical representation is as follows: As a [1] I want [2] so that [3] where [2] – functionality, [3] – benefit, supported by [2], [1] – person, who achieves this benefit. The value of current approach lies in possibility to eliminate misunderstandings, both from developers’ and analytics’ side, regarding concrete system’s features and components. To define whether system behavior is correct or not, we introduce so-called history’s approve criteria. This pattern should be flexible enough to stay uncomplicated for users and analytics but still well-structured enough to be dividable into the parts. For this template, we can use the next form: (Given) set of Pre-conditions, (When) when an event occurs, ( Then ) outcome is achieved. Let’s look at such example: Given: I am an admin user When:  I entered my credentials And pressed “Enter” button Then I should be logged in And see the admin page Scenarios, implemented according to this template could be used as test-cases. Moreover, the main advantage of this approach is easy-to-read format, not only for technicians, but also for users, busyness-analysts, testers and managers and thus helps to improve the understanding-level. World around us is moving forward very quickly. Spheres of business and development have need of direct communication more often. BDD is the approach that helps them find common language. In the next article, we will examine Specflow - .net project for implementing scenarios, described earlier. 1. http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/ 2. http://habrahabr.ru/company/etnasoft/blog/166747/ 3. http://habrahabr.ru/post/139674/ Kirill started programming career with .Net, but later fell in love with JavaScript.

To install SpecFlow plugin in VS go to Tools and open Extension and Updates, load and install SpecFlow and reload IDE. After installation is completed, create Class Library project. Using NuGet install SpecFlow.NUnit. Now specflow files are available and you can add .feature file to the project: We are ready. Let’s imagine that our Product Owner asked to implement Calculator . Development team made the draft interface of Calculator Test context is: All we should do now is to write very simple test using TestFlow for testing addition of 2 numbers. Test contains scenario and implementation’s steps . Steps always start with keywords Given, When, Then. Given – precondition, When — event, that triggers scenario, Then — awaited result. There is also term “ And ” available and it is duplication of above described construction provided for better readability of scenario. For example: Given I have logged as admin And I have opened a page “My Page” Is equal to Given I have logged as admin Given I have opened a page “My Page” But how are we supposed to translate natural language into syntax construction. To do this you should call context-menu and select Generate Step Definitions; in the shown window, we choose Generate Steps and after that, we get something similar to code shown below. As you’ve probably noticed, Specflow makes use of the special attributes for matching methods with scenarios steps . Possibility of this action is checked with regular expression. Thus we get implemented blocks that can be used in other test scenarios and automated tests that can be constructed from existing blocks by Testers. Only missing functionality-pieces need to be implemented by Developers. “5”, “6” and “11” are parameters for this scenario and they can be changed according to current test case.  Let’s write down now real implementation instead of the dummy one. First of all we are going to create constructor that uses implementation context as argument. SpecFlow supports injection into constructor, that’s why no null reference exception occurs. Scenario steps can be represented as follows: To start test run call context menu on .feature file and select “Run SpecFlow Scenarios”. Well-known Unit Test Sessions (NUnit) window will be shown with all tests’ results included. Report contains steps performed by scenario and result. Still SpecFlow is able to do much more. For example it can populate whole structure in one step as  it is described in following case: we need to complete customer’s information with valid data. As you can see from example, SpecFlow uses such tables to pass named parameters into scenario. After performing generation, we get following result: Now all data was passed into method using Table. To get their value, call createinstance <T> and use instead of T class to which you data is mapped. In our case it’s User. The data list we can get alike. The only difference is that we are calling CreateSet: We have examined the simplest tests scenarios. But what should we do with testcases that can use different input arguments? We are supposed to use Scenario Outline. Scenario will execute for each passed case (TestCase analogue in NUnit). Report will include all testcases with their arguments and result of execution. We should also mention here precondition . Precondition is such a method that will be executed before/after scenario or before/after each testcase. It can be useful for setting initial test context before scenario or testcase. This can be in feature file or in code, with the help of BeforeStep, BeforeFeature, BeforeTestRun, AfterScenario, AfterFeature and other attributes. Here is an example. SpecFlow is powerful instrument for writing tests in BDD development process. It allows you to write test using plain text which will be understandable for other non-technical persons. It is connecting link between business-analytics, users and developers of software product. But it can be used not only for desktop application. In the next article I’ll show you usage example of SpecFlow for Web applications with the help of Watin framework. 1. http://www.specflow.org/getting-started/ 2. http://habrahabr.ru/post/182032/ Kirill started programming career with .Net, but later fell in love with JavaScript.

There is a great amount of instruments ( NUnit ) and documentation. But when we speak about Web we shouldn’t forget about the Web-interface layer. We need to have our SpecFlow scenarios connected to Web-browser output. To achieve this goal, we can use Watin (Web Application Testing in .NET). It is used for testing applications in IE and Firefox. First of all using NuGet install Watin package into your project. Let’s imagine that we have Cookbook project for implementation. It’s a web-application that allows user to create, manage and share his recipes with other users. Each user can be registered in the system and afterwards logged in using this registration details. User can create, edit and delete recipes. Each recipe includes ingredients, which can be also added during creation of the recipe. All recipes should be listed on the main page for user. To make restatement of the problem more exact, let’s append a few user stories. I’ve written very simple implementation of this task with the use of MVC4 . Below you can see main page And this is the page with recipe’s details: Let’s start with testing. We create .feature file in the test project. And our first test will be as follows: Add [assembly: RequiresSTA]after declaration of all dependencies [1] . Now by using pre-conditions initiate browser opening before each scenario and it’s closing afterwards. Property to store reference to Browser will be: and two methods BeforeScenario and AfterScenario are: We are ready. Now we are writing implementation for generated steps. Watin allows us to find components (TextFields, Tables, Images and so on) using their parameters (Value, Text, Class …). Page navigation is also possible. Special dictionary for storing URLs lets us keep scenario clean. Implementation of navigation step is: To log in we need to fill fields for username and password and click button “Log in”: As you’ve probably noticed, search is executed in DOM-tree by elements’ identifiers. After that, set up of fields’ values is done and the last step – looking for the button and calling Click: Now we need to have some Asserts to check whether test succeeded. We’ll check what page are we currently on and what text-message we see on the screen. If authorization is executed correctly, user will see «Hello, <user_name>». Now we can run our test. During test execution the browser will be opened and user will be logged in. Test results will be shown on the tab Unit Test Session. Here are all steps and results of the test. Let’s add a few tests for data validation. For each recipe name is a mandatory field. Amount value for ingredients should be numeric. Let’s check this: Some steps are already implemented. After test-run we have all tests green. And one more scenario Its peculiarity is that for this scenario we don’t need to write implementations, everything was done before. Thus scenarios can be created from already existing “ blocks ”. BDD is evolutional phase of well-known TDD , that helps to minimize misunderstanding among Customers, business-analytics, developers and testers. Behavior-driven developers use their native language in combination with the ubiquitous language of domain-driven design to describe the purpose and benefit of their code. This allows developers to focus on why the code should be created, rather than the technical details, and minimizes translation between the technical language in which the code is written and the domain language spoken by the business, users, stakeholders, project management, etc. Watin + SpecFlow – powerful tools for Web application testing in BDD for C# language.

All of my group mates always tried to start doing projects as soon as possible. We had some kind of race all the time. When lectors gave us assignments we never waited till the last moment as usually students do. If someone started handing in their work everybody else tried to catch up. Nobody liked to be the last one. Sometimes all our group mates would hand in study projects way before the deadline, because someone started doing it early (smiling). How did you get in Binary Studio? Oh, that’s an interesting story. Right after the university I was looking for my first job, so I had to go to different interviews. My first job wasn’t at Binary Studio, but I have to tell you the prehistory. The company where I got accepted right after the university was renting an apartment for their office in some building on the second floor. My work in that company lasted 5 years.  Then recession started and I had to look for another place of work. That’s the time I found Binary Studio on the Internet. So, before going there I looked up the address and what do you think? It was the same address where I went 5 years ago: the same building, the same floor, just another apartment, the one across (laughing). Do  you like working with mostly guys in the company? Wow! I can’t imagine the other way around. It’s been like that all the time. What are your main responsibilities in the company? What exactly do you do? I am a senior .NET developer. Right now we work on the Swiss project. We develop software for firemen. I would tell you more, but it is a very long story. What do you like at Binary Studio? I can definitely say that most of all I like people here. They are amazing, outstanding and unique personalities.  I also value the management team at Binary Studio. They always take into account your point of view. It is great, that there is always a possibility to agree upon some decision that would consider your personal interests and interests of the company. Can you share with us some flashback about Binary Studio? Well… I think I can. It was some time ago. We had just moved in the new office on the sixth floor with a huge balcony. So, of course there were preparations before our first working day. We stayed late in the office doing some work on the balcony and didn’t even notice how it got dark. The view from this balcony was so beautiful that I can’t even describe it. We were sitting there with our legs hanging out to the street. Even though I am so afraid of heights, I didn’t even think about it, I was just enjoying the moment and the view. It was really great! Name 5 things that would characterize your personality at this moment. That is a difficult question you ask. First of all I like to ride bicycle, sometimes I use it to get to work (1). I can’t say that I am a super great rider, but last year I used to ride bike to work every day. I’ll tell you more. My lunch box was always taken from home, so there was no need to buy anything on my way to work.  At some point I realized that I hadn’t used my wallet for more than two weeks and it was very weird. Usually we use our wallets many times a day. And I didn’t even know where it was and how much money I had in it (laughing). One more thing I take with me every day is mp3 player (2). Mostly I listen to books. Music? I would say not too often. It seems to me that you have to listen to music… hm... very attentively I could say. Everything started because of English. What I mean is that I have to understand clients at work, so I downloaded various lectures (on philosophy, literature etc.) to understand the language. Usually I try listening one book couple of times, so even if I don’t hear something from the first time, it is not a problem. Let’s move on. I try not to get attached to clothes or to some things, because once I do, I always lose or break it. Although, I have a really cool cup, which I like a lot (3). I bought it in Disney Land in Paris this December. Also, I can’t imagine my life without English and German (4). I missed one more thing and it is international passport cover with elephants (laughing) (5). And of course, I am crazy about traveling, who isn’t?:) And the easiest question =) What did you have for lunch today? Ha-ha-ha… I had chop. I like meat a lot, so today I ate pork.

It is great and quite intense. Two of my colleagues are not present today, so I am responsible for most of the work. But it is good, because I like working 😉 How did you get in Binary Studio? Ohh…  You’ll like this story. It started with the invitation from my good friend to her birthday. Among her other guests there was a guy who worked as a developer, for some reason I’d decided that he was working here. By the way, he attended our last Academy. So, he told me about some great company in Donetsk called Binary Studio and that I could apply for their summer programm Academy. It was the ending of my forth course at university, so I got so excited about the work and such opportunity that at home I looked through Binary Studio web site and found out that there were no vacancies open. I thought: “Well… Ok… There is nothing I can do about it”. So I just read the information about the company, but didn’t send my CV or anything else. After around three weeks I got a call from some unknown number: “Hello! Is it Kirill? My name is Kate, I work as Human Resources Manager at Binary Studio. I know you are finishing your forth year at University. Would you consider our job opening?” I remember I asked her where she got my number, but it was loud around so I couldn’t hear the answer. And until today it is still a mystery where Kate found my number. At that time I was a student and of course I agreed. Kate sent me the test assignment on Silverlight, although I knew only C# and WPF. But Silverlight is similar to WPF just in web. Until that time I never wanted to work with internet and become a web developer. At home I opened that assignment and understood that I wouldn’t be able to finish it within 3 days. No sleep at nights, working all the time that was the price of my work here=) Finally, somehow I almost made it work and at the last moment the Internet connection broke down. Only couple of hours were left before the deadline. The only right decision was to take my laptop and go to my friend to finish the work.  Three days later Kate called me and invited to the interview. My first time at Binary Studio I started looking for that gus who advised me this company and it appeared that he had never worked here. It was just a coincidence.  So, I passed the interview for the Academy, and it was amazing time of my life. Even at home I kept on working, learning something, doing projects, and I had a great desire to do all tha t. I didn’t do anything except the Academy for a month, but it was worth it. And after that I became a junior developer here. That’s my long story. Oh… I forgot to tell you… There was one more interesting moment during Academy. I was always confused with “am” and “pm” system. So, we had a meeting scheduled for 6 pm. And I couldn’t understand why it was so early in the morning. I had to wake up at 4 in the morning and go to the office. By the time I came to the door it had been 5:55 in the morning and nobody was there, the door was closed. Fifteen minutes at the door…. I felt something was wrong. I decided to reread the letter, it was 6 pm, I googled “am” and “pm” and understood everything:) After this accident there is no question in my head about “am” and “pm”. I don’t think I’ll ever make this mistake again. What do you like at Binary Studio? First of all I like people here and the atmosphere that our girls work on. It's really amazing. Some interesting events always happen at Binary Studio, although you are never disturbed from your work.  What I mean is you can come here on Saturday, do something that is also connected with development just for yourself, just for fun and get some pizza. Woudn’t you like it?  In such atmosphere you get a desire to work, not only sit 8 for hours a day 5 days a week surrounded by 4 walls. Can you share with us some flashback from your life? Eventually my brightest memories are about love. I remember I did some crazy stuff. There was a period in relationship when my girlfriend and I kind of broke up, but I still invited her out for dates. I knew that for quite a while she wanted to ride horses, so I found a place where it was possible. But it wasn’t my main plan. I asked one of my friends for help. Beforehand we bought a huge bouquet of white roses.  After the horse-riding my girlfriend and I went to the quay, my friend was supposed to be waiting not far from there and be ready for my signal. So, while we were walking I told her: “I’ve got a surprise for you”. I closed her eyes with my scarf and took her to the place where flowers were supposed to be. But there was nothing! My friend appeared to fear that someone would steal flowers and hid them a little bit. So I was like: “Can you wait here for a second”. And she was standing with covered eyes in the middle of the quay. Of course it wasn’t that long, but I felt like it was forever. In the end it looked very romantic and beautiful: evening, full moon, white roses and we are together. Name 5 things that would characterize your personality at this moment. If we speak about clothes than I like shirts a lot (1). Although I do not wear them very often, but I have 10 pieces of those at home. I think that men should wear shirts. But at the same time I consider developers are very creative people, so shorts and a t-shirt are the best for work. Second thing is my backpack (2). I don’t think I can live without it. Even if I need to carry only like three pieces of paper in it I still take my backpack with me, it makes me feel comfortable. I remember that somewhere around my first and second years at university I used to carry a folder case, which was very popular that time. But how can you feel good if your hands are busy all the time with that folder? I also like bananas very much (3). It is product № 1 in my life which I can eat around 2 kg at a time. It was my third course at university my parents left for the sea for summer. I was lazy to cook, so I just bought bananas and cookies, and that how I was living. Ok… One more thing is a watch (4). At this moment I can’t afford the one I really want but it is coming in the future. And right now if I leave my house without a watch on my hand the day may be counted as lost. Of course I don’t see my life without a computer, because every day I work with it (5). Although I have very negative attitude to social networks. I think it is better to call or meet the person you want, and understand the emotions. I can call my friends using Skype and chat or play online with them. Of course sometime there are moments when I feel like being alone. By the way, I like climbing waste banks. Sometimes it very useful just to go there and think. Later in the future I really want to get an owl as a pet. Really… They are very cute 🙂 What priorities do you have in life? I think career takes the first place in my life at the moment. Family in meaning mom and dad, of course, is the most important, but if we speak about wife and kids then for now it is career. Somewhere deep inside I want to travel, just to live in different countries, see how it works there. I would like to live in Silicon Valley, in some IT city and I think I stll have a chance in my life, because I am still 22 🙂 And the easiest question 🙂 What did you have for lunch today? Pilau with meat. Diana’s position in company matches her life motto “Happy to help” just right.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "cpp-incomplete-type", "author": ["Andrew Kramarenko"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/07/16/cpp-incomplete-type/", "abstract": "Introduction After my last article about usage of std::auto_ptr<T> I want to stop on interesting thing which I have faced during one project. It has name incomplete type and you can challenge with it through std::auto_ptr<T> one day. Of course you can face it in other cases, but after my advice to use auto pointer if your compiler doesn't support C++11, I should tell about incomplete type with std::auto_ptr<T>. Nature of incomplete type or let's speak about forward declaration Probably you have already met such thing in C++, but if combination of words \"incomplete type\" doesn't say anything to you, it is because of work behind your eyes. Incomplete type can be in few cases and most often they are: * you create array without any size: extern char chrarr[]; // chrarr is incomplete type. * you declare class\\structure\\union\\enum without its full definition: I'm going to talk about the later case. It is called forward declaration. It is very useful trick in C++ and can be used when in declaration of class it is enough to use forward type for pointers and references. Indeed forward declaration suffices as type for pointers and references because for compiler it's enough to know size of address (e.g. 4 bytes for 32-bit system and 8 bytes for 64-bit system). Full use case looks like this: * header file \"IncompleteClass.h\": * source file \"IncompleteClass.cpp\": As you can see in header \"IncompleteClass.h\" file we have declared “Resource” type and it is incomplete. We don't have much information about it, but we successfully set this type for \"resource\" field. With incomplete “Resource” type in header file we can't: * construct “Resource” instance; * get sizeof(Resource); * use pointer arithmetic; * use “Resource” type by value; * inherit from “Resource”. Incomplete type has such restrictions, because compiler doesn't have much information. But at the same time in source file \"IncompleteClass.cpp\" we have included file \"Resource.h\" which has all information about this class. It gives us the possibility to work with “Resource” instance as usual. So why forward declaration is necessary? C++ programmers use them in several cases: * reduce dependencies between header files; * resolve circle referencing of header files; * hide implementation of internal classes of a library; * provide backward compatible binary interface for a shared library. Last two are very useful when you deliver your product in binary form with header files and don't want to show internal implementation or break binaries that are already compiled against your library. So at the moment everything is OK, but lets use std::auto_ptr<T> for managing lifetime of “Resource” instance. Forward declaration + std::auto_ptr<T> = UB or something what you don't expect With std::auto_ptr<T> IncompleteClass will look like this: * header file \"IncompleteTypeUB.h\": * source file \"IncompleteTypeUB.cpp\": “Resource” implementation you can see there . It just prints information to standard output on its creation and destruction. Let's run such code: When I first stumbled upon such situation it caused segmentation fault, but during writing this article with another compiler I got in output: Resource is constructed. and program completed as usual, but it didn't say anything about destruction of “Resource” instance! It means I got leak in my program! “Why? We have used std::auto_ptr<T>!” You would say. If you go back to header of IncompleteClass, you will see that it doesn't have destructor. I hope you know that if C++ compiler doesn't find destructor of class, it will be auto-generated. So in declaration of IncompleteClass there will be generated destructor which must call destructors of all fields of class. So it will call destructor of std::auto_ptr<Resource> which must free “Resource” instance. But at that time “Resource” type is still incomplete. Compiler doesn't know about correct destructor of “Resource”! So it puts something that developer of compiler thinks about this world, because it is undefined behavior. Ways to deal with incomplete type issue or at the beginning  of cross roads What can we do about this? 1. Simpler way – include header file of “Resource” class in header of “IncompleteClass” or where it is used. It will give necessary information for compiler to auto-generate correct destructor for “IncompleteClass”. See: It prints: Resource is conscructed. Resource is released. But it isn't great because what if you use forward declaration for hiding internal implementation of Resource (one of the reasons to use forward declaration listed above). It corrupts our plans! 2. Another way if you use std::auto_ptr<T> is to add destructor for “IncompleteClass” and write its definition in source file. Check header file now: And source file: Destructor in source file is empty, but in this translation unit compiler has information about “Resource” class. It will help to call correct destructor of Resource instance. Weakness of such variant is that actually you don't want to declare destructor of “IncompleteClass”, but development forces you, because you used std::auto_ptr<T> to avoid managing lifetime of an instance. It is up to your pride: if you choose this way or not. 3. Actually what I said is true for compilers before C++11. If you compile such code with C++11 and replace std::auto_ptr<T> with std::shared_ptr<T> it will work without needless destructor or direct header including. Look at the following header file: and this source file: Unfortunately, you can't use std::unique_ptr<T> with incomplete type instead of std::auto_ptr<T> because it tries to get size of() of held instance in static_assert() check. Anyway it causes compile error for my version of GCC and I don't think that it can be cross platform because of this. But likely std::shared_ptr<T> can work with incomplete type without extra destruction for class-keeper or direct including of forwarded class. Conclusion. In this article I have told about combination of std::auto_ptr<T> and incomplete type through forward declaration of class, because such love story has pitfalls. There is an issue with undefined behavior on destruction of held instance of std::auto_ptr<T>. In some cases it can be crash of the application, in some cases it can be leak of held instance. I have shown three ways how to handle such situation: · direct including header of held class (worst); · define empty destructor (better); · use C++11 and std::shared_ptr<T> (good). As usual you can find article's code in my G ithub repository, but at this time it has little difference with code in article because I have faced issues with compiling example code at one build. If you are looking for my previous articles, you can find them here: · “ Do not muddle pointers and references ”; · “Extended talk about references and pointers” ; · “Haters gonna hate or life without pointers before C++11” ; · “Haters gonna hate or life without pointers in C++11 times” .", "date": "2017-02-09"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "template-as-double-edged-sword-basic-knowledge", "author": ["Andrew Kramarenko"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/08/04/template-as-double-edged-sword-basic-knowledge/", "abstract": "Introduction In previous articles I often used std::auto_ptr<T> or other smart pointers. I explained only how to work with them but I didn't tell you how they provide handling of pointers of different types. Also every time I wrote <T> sign. Yep, in this article I'm going to describe technique of templates in C++. C++ standard library is full of templates and I have already mentioned lots of stuff therefrom, but without information on how it works. After struggling with pointers and references, it's time to explain next powerful and unclear thing in C++ - templates. Template function or light introduction to templates Let's begin from the simplest one. Imagine that we have the following function for calculating sum of two squares: Hm, okay. Few days later you understand that you need the same function, but for double type and you write this: Hm, so now you have two functions in your project which differ only in type. Also you need to maintain these two functions: if you find a bug in one function, you should remember about fixing the other one. So this is the first place where templates are your friends: You see syntax of templates above. It consists of: template - keyword which means beginning of a template declaration; <typename DataType> - list of comma-separated template arguments. In our case it has one argument with name DataType, typename is another keyword which can be replaced with “class” keyword, but typename is more preferable in most cases as it's more general. Next lines are usual declaration of a function with one difference: as type we have used DataType everywhere. Lets see how to use it: As you can see we used template function as usual, but full calls of SquareSum() as I said in comments are: <int> and <double> specify type of template argument DataType. When compiler faces the call of template function it generates function with necessary types. If it is already met, compiler gets predefined function. So instead of writing function with different types manually compiler as humble servant does it for us. As for why it was enough to write SquareSum(intX, intY) or SquareSum(doubleX, doubleY), modern compilers have template argument deduction. My compiler gcc is smart, it deducts types. If it can't do it, it will print a compiler error for you and probably you will need to specify template arguments directly in <> after template function. Currently we have function with the same type for two arguments x and y. Let's extend our template argument list: As you probably guessed we have an issue with return type of the function. See such calls of our new template functions: Here we get different results by the same data, because generated template for SquareSum(intX, doubleY) call return into type which cuts off result to integer value. In second case everything is okay because return type is double. So you must beware of such situations, because it is restriction of templates for functions which you can't avoid. Template class or increase templates issues Classes can be used as template too, just as functions. Let's see implementation of template class which encapsulates dynamic array and provides custom methods for its handling: Actually this class is wrapper for std::unique_ptr<T> just for showing common work with templates in class declaration. As you see declaration of template class begins with template keyword and template argument list as template function does. Next thing which you must observe is that template argument DataType is used as: Possibility (1.2) is very useful when you need to initialize template variable with its default value which I use for initializing every item of array by zero. Let's see usage of such class now: In line (2.1) we have declared variable with template class type. Compiler can't deduct template arguments here so we set them directly by <int>. After this line we work with arrayKeeper as usual instance without any changes. One of disadvantages of template classes (functions have the same) is that most probably you will declare them only in header files. Because of template nature you can't put implementation to a separate source file. It compiles but causes errors during linking such code. There is a way with template exporting (use export keyword with template), but mainstream compilers don't support it. Actually it is implemented in a few not really popular compilers and unfortunately C++ community doesn't accept this because of some issues with this technique. Also there is another way to write implementation of templates in source files through explicit instantiation. Look at my example: In header file you see that we have just defined template class and its constructor. In source file at (3.3) we have declared template constructor of template class and at (3.1), (3.2) we have explicitly set possible types of template. Without these code (3.4) and (3.5) won't be linked, it will cause linker errors, but with the help of explicit instantiation we successfully avoid it. I think you understand that on every usage of template class with new types it will force us to write explicit declaration of every method of class in source file. So most programmers don't like this overhead (which also limits use cases of the file) and just leave implementation of template classes in header files. Likely you will also act in the same way. Bad side of templates or on another side of the Moon At the moment templates look great, but unfortunately if we get deeper, you will understand: 1. Usage of templates makes build process slower, because of lots auto-generated code and type deduction. 2. It is hard to debug auto-generated function\\method. It isn't an easy task for debugger to understand correctly auto-generated code at run-time. 3. Code bloat - every auto-generated code increases size of object\\executable file. 4. You can't easily separate code entity into definition in header and declaration in source file. Thus it's not good to use them for libraries when you want to hide implementation. 5. Also every minor change in header file with template class usual causes rebuild of big part of a project. 6. Nested templates (template in template I will talk about this in next articles) are not supported by all compilers or they have restriction for level of nesting. 7. Default compile error messages with complicated templates are usually huge, which makes it harder to understand what's going on. As you can notice besides powerful force of templates which might help you, it has long list of disadvantages. They make you wait longer during building process and in some cases it makes your life harder. Conclusion In this topic I began talking about primary technique which is used in C++ standard library. I have already used it through smart pointers and std::vector<T> in my previous articles. I have shown that templates are very powerful for programmer for writing less code, but on the other hand it can force you to take a challenge. Indeed templates are double-edged sword. In my next articles I will continue talking about templates and will get deeper and deeper in their force and madness. I am going to talk about usage of templates with OOP stuff, keyword typename, specification of templates, duck typing and calculations at compile time. Examples of code from article you can find in my G ithub repository.

I attended meetups where aspiring entrepreneurs shared their ideas, tech gatherings where founders and developers discussed the trends they saw in industry, and I participated in a presentation about how outsourcing development can work for the startup industry. While it was cool seeing how members of the community attempted to address the issue of finding developers, it seems like some of the typical questions appeared again and again. The purpose of this post is to provide a perspective on some of the most common ones, and hopefully help direct your thinking if you're considering outsourcing for the first time. Knowing your project. Before going further, I want to point out that some of the assumptions in this article are based on the idea that if you're looking for development you need more than just a simple one-off project. This is targeted more towards those startup idea is built around a technical software platform that needs to be developed and improved to meet the demands of users on a regular basis. It's these people with more frequent development needs for whom the question of finding developers is constant. If you are coming at this from a non-technical side, it is absolutely critical to involve someone you trust in the decision-making process. As you hopefully know already, turning business requirements into software is notoriously difficult, and is somewhat hopeless for the unskilled. Ideally, you already have software team which has been creating the early iterations, but if not, consider hiring a local project manager or consultant to help you make the decision. How Can I Hire Developers for my Startup? Anyone involved with software work knows that finding good developers is really hard. Even if you can find the people you need, building a team that has both necessary technical abilities and programmers you can work with may require you to swallow a pretty strong hit of sticker-shock. Moreover, finding developers requires a blend of networking, job posting, and interviewing, all things that may take you away from doing what you actually care about. If you don't want to settle for the resources available locally, you have a few other options: I won't go too much into the details comparing the different options, since it basically comes down to the simple necessities of know your project. Odesk/Elance/Freelancer.com If you can write out exquisitely detailed technical specs, and your projects is not too complicated, something like Odesk could allow you to minimize costs, and get something mostly-usable. Generally both the cheapest and the riskiest solution, with the most potential variation in results. Local consultants If you have more complex short-term requirements, and can afford to pay, hiring an expert local contractor could allow you to build something great. A local expert could also help you write specifications for project outsourcing, or serve as a project manager or consultant with your external team. The most expensive option, but sometimes a necessity. Project contracting with development company If your background is non-technical, or you have a fixed, short-term project, reaching out to development companies who offer full project management might be a good option. Still, it’s hard to fully endorse this strategy if there is not a tech lead on your side to evaluate the software coming out. An option somewhere in the middle, as long as you can figure out a way to make sure that your partner is trustworthy and committed, this could be effective for small and midsize projects. Recruiting abroad A relatively new option, it could also be possible to recruit abroad and bring the developer onshore. This does seem to hold have a lot of the same problems as trying to find developers locally, with the added headache of foreignness. Still, the quality of developers available in Eastern Europe for example makes this a potentially interesting option if you have the time to look into it. See also the later question about CTOs. Building a dedicated development team abroad For obvious reasons, I’m biased towards the last option 🙂 For those of you in the enviable position of having a technical lead capable of making business decisions about needed functionality, and stable enough to count on the need for long term development, building a dedicated team is essentially the same as expanding your own team locally, but without most of the hassle and with all of the cost and availability benefits of working outside of Western Europe. Do I want to do fixed-price, project outsourcing, or dedicated development? No clue. Each of the models has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the effectiveness will depend completely on the specifics of your requirements. Where should I outsource? Obviously the big regional question of Eastern Europe or India/Asia has to do with a number of different factors. I have spoken to people who have had great results with development companies out of India or Asia, and I've also heard some flabbergasting, crazy stories. Typically, Eastern Europe is more consistent – the rapid growth in the outsourcing industry there demonstrates the very high quality level of software developers in the region. Still, there's no question that outsourcing to Asia is cheaper on a per developer/per hour basis. If you can somehow effectively vet your development team, control the process, and stay secure against shenanigans, such a team could deliver an awesome return on investment. The pitch for Europe though, is that with better time zones, similar culture, and consistent developers, the level of uncertainty is lower, and the ability for long-term cooperation may be higher. Can I outsource my CTO/technical cofounder? This was a fun one that I got asked a lot while traveling – I don't really know. Typically people tend to value stability more in the East, and so the prospect of changing countries and seeking opportunity may be less appealing. You also run into the question of how to recruit with such an amorphous job description. On the other hand, if you have a little bit of funding to help with the move and cushion the blow, it could be very exciting for someone. It's certainly possible, give it a try. Hell, send me a desired resume, and I'll ask around myself. Does outsourcing work for startups? As shown in the above explanations, the obvious answer is a highly qualified yes. Outsourcing can be a fantastic resource, helping you get the team or project results that you need, but it's not a magic bullet. Choosing the wrong company or team, failing to be prepared, misunderstanding the process, all of these things can lead to issues down the road.

In this topic I'm going to continue with interacting templates in object oriented design and I want to talk about typename keyword. Less introduction words - let's see what I am talking about. Templates and class features or level up your project with terrible things In previous article I declared class SimpleTemplateClass<DataType>. I propose to inherit from this class a new one and add new features of templates. There is a big chuck of code which I will describe below: First of all look at (1.1) line. There is a new feature of template argument list: It is called default templates argument. If we don't set this argument then it will be int by default: In such declaration variable's DataType will be taken as int type by default. You can use such feature only in the trailing template arguments. It means you can't write such code: It is wrong and will cause compile error. It will compile when you define default argument for B or move template argument A to the end of the list. In line (1.2) we inherit our new class InheritTemplateClass from SimpleTemplateClass. As you see code set template argument DataType for inherited template class. It is requirement of template inheritance to determine template argument list of parent class. In line (1.3) we call appropriate constructor of template parent class with determined template argument list. Lines (1.4) and (1.5) are very interesting. I want to show you such an example code: In lines (2.1) and (2.2) we have made instances of template classes with different types. Line (2.3) causes compile error because arrayKeeperDouble and arrayKeeperInt are different auto-generated types. If they are generated from one template, it doesn't mean that they are same and compiler doesn't know how to assign them. Overloaded assignment operator of InheritTemplateClass<DataType> in lines (1.4) and (1.5) helps to deal with this. And yes, it is template method of template cs! It defines new template with new template argument RValueType in line (1.4) which is used as type for template argument in other SimpleTemplateClass<RValueType> instance. In body of such operator= we make new internal array and through static_cast<T>() in line (1.6) assign to new array values from array of assigned right hand side instance. static_cast<T>() provide converting from one type to another which helps a lot in line (2.4). Templates and virtual methods or it is not always what you expect In the previous section I have told about inheritance which is one of OOP pillars. Let's observe virtual methods which provide polymorphism in C++. There is a pitfall with template methods. Let's see such huge chuck of code: Let's observe everything in its order: (3.1) is base class which has virtual method (3.2). (3.3) is inherited class from base class and it has template method (3.4) with the same name as virtual method of parent class. If you add virtual key word for (3.4) it will causes compile error, because actually it can't overload virtual method even if it has same auto-generated signature. But some programmers can expect overloading because even without virtual key word it must work. (3.5) is template class which inherited by BaseClassA and it also has method VirtualMethod as parent class. Let's check how everything works by running such code: Line (4.1) confirms what's stated above: there is no call of overloaded virtual method of child class because it wasn't exactly overloaded. It calls method of the base class. But line (4.2) shows that for template class which is generated VirtualMethod() with int type it works as expected. It calls overloaded method and even its signature was generated by template. Otherwise it looks as in line (4.3). There was generated VirtualMethod() with double type which doesn't overload virtual method. So this line calls method from the base class. As you see there are issues with overloading template classes and methods so beware: it won't work every time even if you hope so. Key word typename or let compiler know what you said typename is more than you think. Before it was used only in template argument list, but it has another useful meaning. It is necessary when you have some internal class in other class and you want to use that type from template argument type. I am sure it sounds horrible and confuses you. So, let's see it in the next code: In line (5.1) we have internal class of ExternalClass which is created by method in line (5.2). Declared class in line (5.3) uses InternalClass as type for its field in line (5.4), but we need to get this type through ExternalClass, which is default template type of ClassUsesTypename class. Compiler has lack of information here, because expression TData::InternalClass looks for its like many other things: is it static field or obtaining address of method? It guesses that it is type, but maybe it is programmer typo or mistake so compiler shows error here without required typename keyword in line (5.4). This is for what typename stands for. If you have experience with iterators from C++ standard library, you probably faced with this keyword before. Now you know why it is required, because iterators are internal classes of containers. Conclusion Today I have discussed interacting templates in object oriented designed solutions. Article shows different issues with inheritance of classes and overloading of virtual methods. Besides this there were extra features of templates such as: template methods, default template argument type. As separated entity was shown typename keyword which is useful to give the cue for compiler when we use internal class of templated type. For the next article about templates I have left such questions as: specification of templates, duck typing and calculation at compile time. So see you soon. Examples of code from article you can find in my G ithub repository. My previous articles from “.CPP files” series are:", "date": "2017-02-09"},

I told basic information about templates: their disadvantages, interacting with OOP, typename keyword, but it is not enough! There are still many things to investigate and learn. Today my topics are specification of templates and duck typing technique which forms basis for templates. Template specification As you already know that template class\\function provides generating of code for given types. However, what should you do if you need to change behavior of template code for some reasons for specific type? This is for what template specification stands for. It provides instrument to completely change implementation of template for some type or set of types. Let's begin with the following example of template class: I have declared template class which keeps some data and it must be a container with continuous item - for this I will use static arrays. In constructor of this class you see that input argument will be copied to private field someData. Method ExtendWithValue() allocates new dynamic array in which copies internal data, adds input value to the end of dynamic array and returns it. Yep, it means that there will be returned new array which is bigger than internal array on one item and its last item will be passed value. It is some kind of extending. Let's see it in action: So, in line (1.1) there is declared static array with dimension - 3 and items - 1, 2, 3. In line (1.2) there is an instance of our template class which template arguments are: TDataKeeper is int[3] and TDataType is int. This instance holds copy of passed array as argument. Finally in line (1.3) method ExtendWithValue(4) is called which returns new array whith dimension - 4 and its items - 1, 2, 3, 4. Those items are printed to standard output. Okay, after some time we want something similar but with std::string as template argument. Most probably it won't work, but template specification is going to help us! See the following code with specification: Code above declares specification of template class SpecificationTemplate for types std::string and char. Let's observe lines in their order. Line (2.1) contains line with template keyword, but it has empty template argument list! Because in next line (2.2) we manually specify template arguments as TDataKeeper is std::string and TDataType is char. So, in lines (2.3) and (2.4) we can use those types directly which lets us to implement SpecificationTemplate class in a different way then the main template. For example in line (2.5) we use method std::string::push_back() to extend copy of internal string. Thus it works in the following example: Without specification of template for std::string this code will cause compile errors, but we have declared specification for such types and compiler can use it here. As you see specification has absolutely different implementation, because instead of auto-generating new code compiler takes our specified SpecificationTemplate<std::string, char>. Of course, specification of templates doesn't need concretization of all template arguments. Header of SpecificationTemplate can look like this: Actually, I have already mentioned this technique when i was talking about std::unique_ptr<T> for single instances and std::unique_ptr<T[]> for dynamic arrays. Now it must be obvious for you that correct freeing of allocated memory by new and new[] is provided by specifying template with correct destructor. Duck typing or can you quack for me? Duck test says: When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck. So how it looks in programming? Especially in C++? As always I will start  with some examples to show: 1. I want to begin from afar with very common practice of command pattern implementation, I think you know it: As you see I have used interface of abstract class Command to implement two different commands AwesomeCommand0 and AwesomeComman1 for using them through one function which executes them having no idea what command it is  exactly, but it knows about their parent class. 2. Now let's make the same, but without inheritance with help of templates. Check it out in the following code: As you see AdorableCommand0 and AdorableCommand1 don't have same parent, BUT at the same time they use in template function ExecuteTCommand(). Furthermore ExecuteTCommand can handle instances of classes AwesomeCommand0 and AwesomeCommand1 at the same time. It is because of duck typing. Templates have such mechanism for generating code: if template argument type has every property which is used in code than it is duck... I am sorry: correct code and can be generated anyway, otherwise it will cause compile errors during building. Because duck typing in C++ has static behavior during compiling process. If you tried to use templates from some library, probably you would face with such compile errors because your implementation wasn't duck and it would go away when you make it quacking. In such way by help of duck typing templates provide style of typing in which instance can have valid semantic without inheritance or explicit interface. On the other hand it causes overhead with looking what is necessary for type to use it in template code. Programmer have to look up for it. Conclusion in this article I continued talking about templates. I have dived deeper with you in a template specification with duck typing. First one provides powerful method to change implementation of original template even for other purpose with specified type or types, but you have to remember that someone else can have no idea about big changes in behavior of template with specified types. Moreover, I have shown duck typing in C++ which is presented by static checking of type properties in template code. Can given type be used or not? It can be used for providing common usage of instances of different type without its inheritance from parent class or having explicit interface. On the other hand it can cause more overhead than normal. In the next article I will talk about calculating at compile time. Sure, it will be interesting.

Currently you use in your everyday work either advanced IDE, which is most probably optimized for a particular language ( JetBrains has a lot to offer you) or plain “swiss-army knives” text editors (Vim, SublimeText, upcoming Atom from Github team). The chances are that some of the guys in your team use another editor, which of course has another configuration throw pillows and in case if you want all of you to follow the uniform code style, it will be quite painful to configure all the editors similarly and even to force everyone to do this. That’s when the Editorconfig may seem to you very handy. Trey Hunner and Hong Xu are the guys who came up with the idea of universal configuration for all of the text editors. All the properties you need should be placed into the file named .editorconfig which should be placed in the root of your project or in any folder which needs separate set of rules. Plugin for the editor will look for this file in the same directory as the file or in any parent directories. The only irrespective to files' property is root. If truthy, it tells plugin to stop searching for the config. root = true Next goes the pattern which will match the files you need to define config for. Editorconfig supports wildcard matching: [*], [*.py], [*.js], [lib/**.js] or names listing [{package.json,.travis.yml}]. Next goes the most meaningful part which represents the actual rules for files defined. I will list the properties supported by most of the plugins, which are taken from the official docs, but there were also my own observations added to some of them. indent_style : tab or space. indent_size : a whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). When set to tab, the value of tab_width (if specified) will be used. tab_width : a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab character. This defaults to the value of indent_size and doesn't usually need to be specified. end_of_line : lf, cr, or crlf to control how line breaks are represented. As a windows user I wasn’t able to find it important until worked with npm modules which are intended to be installed globally. You may take it as a rule that for cross-platform development you’ll need lf line endings . charset : set to latin1, utf-8, utf-8-bom, utf-16be or utf-16le to control the character set. Use of utf-8-bom is discouraged. trim_trailing_whitespace : set to true to remove any whitespace characters preceding newline characters and false to ensure it doesn't. insert_final_newline : set to true to ensure file ends with a newline when saving and false to ensure it doesn't. True may be helpful if you expect this files to behave fine with Unix tools as cat. I tried Editorconfig on SublimeText and Visual studio and both worked very well for me. In order to show you what they do for you, I will compare .efitorconfig properties to editors’ ones. Sublime The plugin is initially created by Sindre Sorhus . It can be installed via Package Control for both Sublime 2 and 3. The corresponding properties of Sublime config are: Visual Studio VS does not assume that you specify properties in the text file and instead gives you the possibility to define it in GUI: Tools -> Options->Text Editor -> All Languages I’m  not sure if other properties could be even set with the same meaning and not just checkboxing ‘Save documents as Unicode when data cannot be saved in codepage’. Nevertheless, I believe that you understand all the complexity Editorconfig solves and I personally think that such projects help us to build beautiful code in all its meanings.

How did you become a developer? Well..I guess I’ll start with my school years, so I studied in school №113 from 1998 until the 8 th grade. After that I entered Donetsk lyceum called “Intellect”. Of course, it wasn’t my decision from the beginning because in my 14 th I couldn’t understand the importance of this choice - I didn’t care at all. There were three ways of future specialization to pick: humanities, economist or apply to the Informatics and Technology class where I studied. It is very unexpected, isn’t it?:) I mean I liked it a lot: until the 9 th grade it was kind of my hobby. Starting from 9 th grade I participated  in different contests  as everybody else. So, after the 11 th grade I had no other choice but to continue exploring development. Oh, noooo… I did have a choice – not to apply to the university at all;) All of my five student years were very interesting and exciting. I mean studying was easy, but the fun part was very cool,  although I was a very diligent student. I was studying in the university when I had decided to start working. At first of course it wasn’t a full time job - I made lab assignments or course papers for other students from my group. That’s the time when I started earning money. It was my last month before getting a Bachelor degree, when I applied for a full time job. What we did was game development for iPhone and iPad, different apps written in C++. I also had some experience working with Win32 and MVC. There was the time when I understood that writing in this technologies was time-consuming and the apps looked not the way I liked, so I needed some changes. Usually at this point developers go two ways: Java and C#, not including those who had chosen PHP before. By that time I had already tried to write in Java and got the understanding that it didn’t work out for me. So, my choice was easy to make - C#. The first time when I used C# was in the university when I also explored WPF. I understood that using C# it is possible to write cool apps in a short period of time and that influenced me a lot – I was absolutely into C#. In 2012 I got the offer for a job to write in C++ and out of curiosity I decided to accept it. The person who invited me was my friend’s acquaintance. The company was placed in some rented apartment which kind of surprised me. I went there – we drank some coffee, talked, did some tasks on computer and I was hired. At the beginning I was working remotely and after finishing university I was able to be present at the office every day. That was my first experience working in the office full time and I liked the atmosphere. We were working 8 hours straight, but there were times when we could communicate, tell jokes and have some fun. Game development in general is an interesting area of development – particularly testing. There  was an assignment to port  existing games to Play Station, so we could spend half a day testing it 😉 I remember times when I could sit playing games on iPad and no one would say a word, because it was my task to do. September came, so I entered my 5 th course (Master degree). I had a choice – to drop the university or to quit the job. It was so easy to apply for the Master degree that I made a choice in favor of studying, so I had to leave the job. How did you get in Binary Studio? I came to Binary Studio in March right before finishing the Master course. One of .NET developers was leaving the current project and the company needed to replace him urgently. I decided to come to the interview since I heard a lot about Binary Studio from Kirill Buga (he was my group mate and had already been working in the company). It was more of a chance to gain the experience of passing the interview rather than thinking of actuall work at Binary Studio. Even when I was interviewed I wasn’t nervous or worried about the result. My thought were: “If I pass the interview – well… Great. I’ll have to figure out how to combine studying and work. If I don’t – not a problem. Maybe, not this time.” Let me say that I liked the company from my first visit because I got some positive attitude towards it. After a couple of days I received a call from Kate (our HRM) saying that I was hired for the project and had to come to work as soon as possible. So, my first working day was on Friday, which was kind of unusual. So, it was more of a coincidence that I became part of the big Binary Studio team. Let me add that it was a lucky match 🙂 What do you like at Binary Studio? I like that we don’t have such a huge team. It gives the opportunity to have great relations between management and developers and that’s what attracts me. Management takes care of us and the other way around and I am not talking only about corporate trips or holidays.  The atmosphere is so friendly that even new employees after 2-3 weeks of working in a company feel very comfortable like in a family. We are always ready to help each other and that means a lot. Can you share with us some flashback from your life? I don’t know…. I think I can’t answer this question. There are so many different and bright memories in my head that it is impossible to point out only one of them. I always had a lot of things going on in my life and I still do. It starts from getting a bike as a present when I was young and up to now when we moved to Uzhorod. Every half a year I get some huge event happening in my life, so I can’t separate only one. Name 5 things that would characterize your personality at this moment. It is difficult to say right away. I can tell you that every half a year I change my priorities in things I use. Something new appears in my life, something becomes not so important anymore. If we speaking about this moment then for example I have Ukrainian flag standing on my working table (1). Because of all the situation in the country as all normal person I worry about what is going to happen next. It is not because I am such a patriot of my country, but it is Ukrainian flag and Ukraine is my native country, so I’d like all this war to end.  It is also my keyboard and mouse (2). Out of 24 hours a day I spent 19 working at computer and it is not because of my profession. When I am not working I do some of my own assignments, learn new tricks, watch videos or just read news. I guess sarcasm and I are two things that can’t be separated 🙂 (3). It is not something that you can actually show, but it is a part of me. Currently it is not very true but one more thing is bicycle. Some time ago I used to ride it a lot, but now because of the lack of space in the apartment there is no place to keep it. If you talk to my close friends a lot of them will associate me with a soldering iron or a set of tools (4).   Starting from school years I was always interested in radio electronics - I used solder or some other tool to assemble something. We leaved in the house not an apartment, so we had a garage in our back yard where I spent most of my free time. First, I repaired bicycle then I got a motorbike as a present and after all I switched to cars. That’s my story. What priorities do you have in life? As everyone I go to work every day, relax on weekends – live my regular life. Of course I’d like to have my own house and my own car. (This weekend Vitaliy bought a car. CONGRATS!!!) I mean there will always be tangibles in our world. It seems like everything is moving in the right direction and I just let it go, although self-development is very important for me. I’d like to improve my professional skills and achieve great working results in my career - it is always interesting to work on different and interesting projects. I guess the bottom line is that you should move forward and have some progress in life every day. If you stop you can get bored and I don’t like to be bored. And the easiest question 😉 What did you have for lunch today? Vegetable soup with broccoli (I hate broccoli), risotto, chicken Kiev and compote.

According to statistics from Mobify 1.2 billion of people have access to web from their devices. This number obligates us to pay particular attention to the mobile part of the web development. The subject of the mobile web development is mainly regarded in terms of responsive design. There are also some discussions around mobile networking led by Ilya Grigorik . I would like to look at the matter from a different standpoint and check the state of bringing to web applications on mobile more throw pillow from native mobile applications. Specifically in this article I would like to discuss the ways to know the visibility and if processor resources are being allocated for the web page in a browser on mobile during application runtime. Managing application state is one of the fundamental tasks to be performed during mobile application development. Each OS suggests its own application state: Android calls the states we look for paused and stopped, iOS has inactive and background states. These states allow the developer to control the application flow due to the knowledge of user interaction with it at the moment. I wanted to gain similar possibilities within web application. W3C is keeping pace with the times so they proposed Page Visibility API (PVA) as a solution of this problem. Still it is not that widespread and is represented only in the latest versions of mobile browsers PVA is providing document.hidden boolean flag, document.visibilityState string value with such possible values: “visible” – the page is in the foreground of non-minimized application. “hidden” – either page tab is inactive or application is minimized. “prerender” – page content is not visible due to rerendering. Another part of Page Visibility API is visibilitychange event, which allows us to assign listener to it and to be aware of changes of page visibility. David Walsh has written a nice article about taming compatibility issues of PVA . More advanced usage of PVA is implemented in visibilities . It has several time-driven methods with check of page visibility within them on each execution and much more. Library also aims to provide the fallback for browsers which are not supporting PVA through listening to focus/blur events. But it is obvious that this fallback is far from being perfect as blur event is fired not at the moment when the page is hidden but when another window is considered active at the moment, so page can be maximized almost to fullscreen, still considered hidden due to the click out of the browser. Nevertheless, there might be cases when your application needs to show the user information only in the real time and you want to avoid showing it if the application on the page was suspended due to browser minification / phone lock etc. Hypnos module is designed to solve such tasks. It is taking advantage of mechanisms of JS event queue, sets the timer to be executed in certain amount of time and then checks the real time of invocation and the estimated one. In case when time exceeds the defined error device is considered as sleeping. The implementation is pretty simple and may be implemented by each developer from the scratch: The module can be used in case when your app has a chain of actions to be performed but that should happen just in case when the device was not sleeping. So when the returned from hypnos callback value is truthy, you may want to clear your execution queue. Check the live demonstration of it on mobile . To see the sleeping result you should click the button and lock the device at once. The problem of sleeping devices is the part of perceived performance. It once again proves that not only the actual page load time means much, but also the way you react on the certain actions of a user or the state of his browser.

Already a few years ago web-developers either avoided such solutions or used cookies . Cookies are supported by all popular browsers, but they are generally unusable for data larger than 4Kbyte (including name, value and expiry date). There is also no API, so one shouldn’t expect powerful and flexible functionality. And you should be also aware of the fact that server sends cookies back to client with each request and that leads to higher load on connection what can be crucial. With html5 forthcoming developers got possibility to use Local Storage . Local storage is client-side database, which stores data in key/value pairs. Among Local storage’s advantages are: Nevertheless, there is also huge disadvantage – all operations with local storage are synchronous . That is why operations with big data volumes will block your UI. And search API in Local storage isn’t supported. Retrieving of the data is possible only by key. Right after Local Storage appears Web SQL Databases , which also store data locally. For data access, some variation of SQL is used. Requests are executed with SQLite Engine . In this system, we can find not only useful and comfortable syntax but also transactions. But Web SQL DB is not supported anymore. IndexDB is a non-relational, noSQL database, which is much more powerful then simple web storage with key/values pairs accessible through applied WebStorage interface. IndexedDB supports synchronous and asynchronous API, transactions and security of data stored (the same as for cookies). It is suitable for storage big data volumes with possibility of indexation. Need in such an instrument occurred not recently, that’s why it is in HTML5 specifications. Currently it has a status of Candidate Recommendation , which means that specification is approved and waits for decision from community’s developers. All the desktop browsers (except Safari) support IndexedDB, mobile – don’t . Storing big data blocks on mobile device is not the best idea, but if you need it – there are wrappers available (which are using LocalStorage, WebSQL, etc. inside) Such example can be PouchDB ( http://pouchdb.com/ ) or indexedDBShim ( http://nparashuram.com/IndexedDBShim/ ). Deployed database is tied to domain and user and is not accessible from any other place. Each domain can contain a few databases, the only condition is that the name of database should be unique inside this domain. As for storage, IndexedDB is a simple collection of named objects’ storages. Each of them has a key, which is used to access the object itself. Beyond all peradventure this keys are unique and also they should have natural order that can be easily used for sorting. To guarantee key uniqueness we just need to set some primary key field. This is a trivial task in Databases. If object doesn’t have any unique information, indexed DB can generate key. As I told before IndexedDB is not a relational database, data is stored not in tables, but in special storages called ObjectStore . During creation of object store you can pass its name and parameters (key field’s name and flag of key autogeneration). There are four possible behavior scenarios for key field: IndexedDB is a powerful mechanism for creation of autonomic web-applications with huge storages on client side . It has great support from desktop browsers, rich functionality and perfect API, all that gives developer great opportunities for work with data. In the next article, we will take a few practical IndexedDB examples. Kirill started programming career with .Net, but later fell in love with JavaScript.

Before C++11 times it wasn't so easy task, but it's possible. With coming C++11 standard life of programmer became better. Heretofore programmer should use third-party library to use RAII-like entities which are smarter than std::auto_ptr<T> in managing memory. Due to the fact that std::auto_ptr<T> doesn't have reference counting and doesn't provide good sharing data between entities in code. Now C++ standard library has such cool stuff as: std::unique_ptr<T>, std::shared_ptr<T>, std::weak_ptr<T>. Also I am going to talk about std::array<T> little bit, because it is more convenient instead of static arrays. Enumerated entities suit for different cases and give a programmer good tools for resolving  issues. std::unique_ptr<T> instead of std::auto_ptr<T> or saver life with unique variable This smart pointer was born as replacement for std::auto_ptr<T>. That's why the last one is deprecated in this standard. std::unique_ptr<T> has similar interface as std::auto_ptr<T>, but it's better designed and implemented what allows to use this smart pointer when std::auto_ptr<T> can't be used. Let's talk about everything in turn. std::unique_ptr<T> has same user cases as std::auto_ptr<T>. Remind you: From name of smart pointer you should have guessed that only single one std::unique_ptr<T> holds managed instance and it can't be transferred through assignment operator or copy constructor because it is forbidden. But it can be done by move semantics of C++11. See: This works with std::move() because operator =(std::unique_ptr<T>&) is forbidden, but operator =(std::unique_ptr<T>&&) is not. std::unique_ptr<T>&& is a reference to r-value of std::unique_ptr<T> instance. More details about such references to r-value you can read this . It is very important topic about C++11, but is not directly related to this article. Unlike std::auto_ptr<T> unique smart pointer can be used for arrays, because its template declaration has specification for arrays. It correctly deallocates memory, which is allocated with operator new []. Check it out: So instead of using std::vector<T> like I wrote in previous article in C++11 you can use std::unique_ptr<T[]> for holding dynamic arrays in cases if std::vector<T> doesn't fit your needs. If you want, you can get pointer to allocated memory with help of method std::unique_ptr<T>::get(). But don't forget – when unique smart pointer goes out of scope, it frees memory. std::shared_ptr<T> helps to share instance with friends or finally we have standard reference counting std::unique_ptr<T> does not allow sharing instance. Same as std::auto_ptr<T> it doesn't have reference counting. For such target you have to use std::shared_ptr<T>. It counts how many shared pointers hold same instance and destroy instance only when the last referenced pointer is destroyed or it is reset with new value through std::shared_ptr<T>::reset(T*). Typical implementation of shared pointer has fields with managed instance and control block. Control block holds different information about allocation and deallocation of instance and number of smart pointers which point to the same managed instance. Besides these control block holds pointer to managed instance or this instance itself, in case of using std::make_shared which results in object and control block sharing the same memory block. See the following code: std::shared_ptr<Resource> extraAllocation(new Resource());   std::shared_ptr<Resource> singleAllocation = std::make_shared<Resource>(); In the first case instance and control block are allocated separately. In such way you have two allocations and control block holds pointer to created instance. By using std::make_shared<T>() it is done at one time. It creates managed instance and control block at single allocation. It means – it takes less time and has exception safety. Because of that second way is more preferable. In C++14 there will be similar method for unique smart pointer called std::make_unique<T>(). It is added just for convenience. It doesn't have double allocation, but it is awesome to use such help functions. As I said managed instance of shared smart pointer dies when last such pointer to instance is gone away. Lets see the following code for proving which uses std::shared_ptr<T>::use_count() method to show how many pointers manage same instance: As you see std::shared_ptr<T> keeps instance alive while some smart pointer still points to it. So main use case for std::shared_ptr<T> is sharing some object in different part of program and keeping it alive. By the way std::shared_ptr<T> is thread safe type. So it can be used for sharing data in multi-threaded applications, but don't overuse it, because it is significant performance penalty. std::weak_ptr<T> could be dead or never mind when it is alive If std::smart_ptr<T> cares about keeping instance alive, std::weak_ptr<T> works in opposite way. This smart pointer doesn't uphold lifetime of addressed instance. Because of this weak smart pointer is used for cases when you need access to instance when it is still alive. This type of smart pointer is constructed from std::shared_ptr<T>. Take a look at next code: As you see std::weak_ptr<T> is constructed from std::shared_ptr<T>. In my example I did it with assignment operator, but it can be done by passing shared pointer to constructor of weak pointer as well. When you are going to use managed instance from weak pointer you have to call method std::weak_ptr<T>::lock(). It returns std::shared_ptr<T> which extends lifetime of an instance while you are using it. If instance is already destroyed, returned shared pointer will be empty. Also you can use method std::weak_ptr<T>::expired() which indicates whether managed instance still presents or you can forget about its existence. Underlining that was said std::weak_ptr<T> uses for delivering or holding managed instance somewhere for using it without worrying whether it is alive or not. Also its implementation and usage are based on thread safe smart shared pointer, so std::weak_ptr<T> has same ability in multi-threaded applications. std::array<T> as cool as static arrays or avoid using static C-style arrays Of course you can use std::unique_ptr<T[]> for arrays as I have shown above. But C++11 also provides simpler and quicker container for static arrays, which not worse than C-style arrays. I am talking about std::array<T, N>. This container provides storing of fixed range of instances and different methods for enumerating them with iterators. The following code shows how such array can be used with std::sort() function: As you probably noticed std::array<T, N> has two template arguments. T is type of stored instances and N is number of such instances. In shown example I have defined static array with integer values which size is 3. Through std::sort() I have sorted values of this static array. I have used std::begin() and std::end() because it is more preferably in C++11, because implementation of such methods encapsulate method of obtaining first or last iterators of containers. There is std::dynarray<T> in proposal for C++14 standard. It allows to handle dynamic arrays in same way. So it can be totally used instead of std::vector<T> in such cases. It is simpler than std::vector<T> in using. Unfortunately, it looks like it won't make it in the new standard, but you are aware of this now. Someday it will come as <dynarray> include header. Conclusion In this article I have told about C++11 stuff which can be used to avoid using raw pointers. C++11 gives a lot of smart pointers for different goals, such as: std::unique_ptr<T>, std::unique_ptr<T[]>, std::shared_ptr<T> and std::weak_ptr<T>. std::unique_ptr<T> is used for owning single instance and handling its lifetime. std::unique_ptr<T[]> has similar means, but for set of instances. std::shared_ptr<T> is used for managing instance between different part of application and extends lifetime of owned instance. std::weak_ptr<T> is used when you want to work with instance without owning it. Also as separate entity I noticed std::array<T, N>, which can be used instead of static C-style arrays.

Starting form my childhood I guess 🙂 I was born in Kirovsk (near Yenakievo) and at some point my parents decided to move to Donetsk, because Kirovsk was quite a small town. My father is from Russia, so when I was small I always had to travell: Kirovsk – Donetsk – Russia. We had to rent houses since we didn’t have our own place to live when we moved to Donetsk. I guess that was the reason, I studied in different schools in Donetsk. Until the 5th grade I studied in Donetsk Gymnasium, which was similar to kindergarten, but with some educational program different from a regular school. By now I understood that all the knowledge we recieved was really cool and useful. We learned  to write and to read, also studied French, English and German. I remember nothing, but it was important that we learned it. We had meals during the day and relaxing hours were organized for us when we were listening to classic music. We could also play games and do sports outside. The school I graduated from was № 21 where everything was very strict. I mean the studying process and exams were organized and taken very seriously. We had a very interesting English teacher. One day she told us that based on statists Americans didn't know any rules in the English language. We asked her: “Why do we need to learn them, if they don’t?” Her answer was easy: “But  you are not Americans, right?”:) I mean studying in school was interesting although I didn’t like general subjects, I liked Math and Physics.  In my opinion if teachers work hard and give the information in unusual way,  students like to be engaged. We had really cool and fun Physics teacher who explained the material very clearly. She always made jokes and had really creative approach to her subject. I guess if the university curriculum didn't include programmimng, I wouldn’t have become a developer by now. We had subjects such as  \"Mobile connection\" and \"Computer LANs\" which influenced my life a lot. If I hadn’t studied those, I wouldn’t have explored different protocols like TCP IP or the way web works, so the education at the university played a certain role in my life. I wanted to work within my major, but never happened. I wasn’t interested in signals’ modulation or how it interacted, but the technical side of it was really exciting for me in particular modulators, demodulators, and coders. I started looking for a job, unfortunately working experience was obligatory everywhere and I didn’t have any.  So, now I can tell you why I started programming. In summer during my second year of university I got bored, so I asked my friend to explain HTML/CSS-coder to me. For more than two months I was immersed in this information and finally I got hired for the position with part time schedule (hourly rate). I am a self-educated person in this sphere. If we talk about HTML and CSS I had some time to gather working experience, but with PHP there was no time to hesitate. My friend offered to work on the projects together, so I would look for the customers and he would perform the work. I found some PHP projects, but my friend decided to leave it all to me alone. All I could do was to learn PHP as fast as possible. Of course, I finished those projects even though it was very tensely. How did you get into Binary Studio? Well… I was ready to begin working on one project when I got a call from Binary Studio. I was interviewed by Sergei Golovin and Egor Gumenyuk. They kept on asking me questions and I mostly knew the answers. Frankly speaking I told Kate that I had another job offer and that I needed time to think. Next day Kate called and informed me that I had passed the interview and could come to work but I still needed some time to make the decision. I was almost ready to accept the offer from Binary Studio when Kate called me again and made the job offer, I couldn’t resist. So, my choice was made:) What do you like at Binary Studio? I like everything at Binary Studio. I can point out one thing - people I work with. We’ve got here such great unique personalities - easy to communicate with and responsible at the same time, but with their own small world inside. Everyone has their own personal views on life, very special way of communication, but noone is really big headed. Also there is no tension and pressure from the management team. They always talk to you and discuss everything you should be aware of. I get the understanding of safety and the feeling that I won’t get set up at some point which is why it is stable at Binary Studio. I like when my work is worth something and as an example I can tell you about the Academy we organize at Binary Studio. You get the chance to teach students which means that you are considered as a highly qualified professional. Management feels certain in my qualification  and that flatters me. Can you share with us some flashback from your life? I don’t even have to think about it. It was the time I jumped with parachute. So, I went to the airfield; listened to the training; jumped; got a whole range of various emotions,  but only on the ground I understood that I wanted more. I am thinking of doing it again some time later. You get so much adrenalin which is so cool. I’ve got a big dream to fly the jet aircraft. I guess I just want to overcome laws of nature by which I mean that it is accepted people can’t fly, but I want and I will. I think I just like doing things that are out of my comfort zone - challenges. In this story with parachute I was even attracted by the fact that there was a chance for it not to go off. Although I haven’t had a thought: “AAAhhh….It will not go off.” The idea that slipped in my mind was about my actions in case of emergency.  I thought what might be done in this situation and how to solve the problem. Name 5 things that would characterize your personality at this moment. First of all it is my car (1). I don’t know why, but the first time I got behind the wheel the great feeling appeared and I liked it. I guess I don’t see my life without a car.  Maybe the other thing is my watch (2). I carry it with me all the time and take it off only when go swimming. Yesterday I forgot it at home and felt so uncomfortable all day long. Well next thing is my lighter (3). It is a bit shabby, but I like it a lot. I think I bought it around one year ago. At some point I just got the feeling that I wanted a lighter \"Zippo\". So, when I found it there were no doubts. You can see that it is engraved with the eagle. Number four is obviously my phone (4). I never leave it anywhere. My habit is that I am always, let’s say “online”, and can be reached at any moment. I can use it in different ways even just for the entertainment - to surf the Internet or play games. I am ready to help my friends anytime they need it. So even if they call me at 2 am I will pick up the phone and go to help. The last but not the least is my pen – Parker (5). I don’t know why, but I love it. As you can see, it’s very simple, but at the same time it’s not a regular pen. I don’t use it so often, but I love when this pen is with me. I guess that’s all for now. What priorities do you have in life? There is always a goal in my life that has to be achieved. I have some tasks that I need to do and concentrate on those. I think that if there is a problem in your life and you can’t solve it why bother being nervous about it, if you still can’t influence the situation. And if there is a problem you can solve, why should you bother being nervous if at some point you will still influence it. I don’t worry about anything I can’t change. Nobody can say what will happen in 20-30 years. So, you should enjoy the moment you live right now. You never know what might happen tomorrow. And the easiest question 🙂 What did you have for lunch today? That is very easy. I had pasta with meat and salad, tomato juice and a tea with Twix for dessert.

After my two previous articles about references and pointers “Do not muddle references and pointers” and “Extended talk about references and pointers” I am going to tell how to avoid usage of pointers. Modern C++ has everything you need for this. The days when such code with pointers and exceptions was dangerous are gone now: Certainly you can deallocate ptr before throwing exception, but more often programmer just might miss it or be not aware of throwing exception from some function or method. Indeed, even new operator throws std::bad_alloc when it can't allocate requested amount of memory. So in this article I am going to show you how to stay calm with such issues. First of all – RAII or RAII is everything Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a programming idiom for automatic resource initializing and destroying it. In C++ it is implemented through constructor and destructor of class. Thereby if we implement wrapper which manages allocation and deallocation of Resource instance in my first example and create it on stack, we solve our issue with possible leaks. See the following wrapper and its usage: Here RAII helps us to manage lifetime of resource which is allocated on heap, because of throwing exception, compiler generates code which calls destructors of local variables. Thus ResourceWrapper destroys Resource instance anyway. Also C++ standard guarantees that destructor of class is called only if constructor of class is performed normally (without exceptions). It saves us from invalid delete operator invocation in destructor if allocation of Resource instance throws std::bad_alloc. But my ResourceWrapper isn't ideal, because it doesn't handle copy and assign operations well. As a solution I forbade such actions. I told compiler not to generate copy constructor, move constructor (C++11) and assign operator with help =delete from C++11. Without C++11 it can be done through declaration those methods in private section without implementation, linker will show errors on such actions. But I prefer C++11 way because it is clearer. So this is RAII idiom. Let’s see what points of C++ standard library you can use for such cases. std::auto_ptr<T> and single objects or it is not dress for all times There are still lots of projects that don't use C++11, so let’s talk about std::auto_ptr<T> at first. It is deprecated in the last standard, but it is still common for lots of people. std::auto_ptr<T> provides RAII similar to wrapper which I have shown above. With the difference that std::auto_ptr<T> obtains pointer in its constructor or std::auto_ptr<T>::reset(T*) method. Common cases of use for this entity are: But beware of other cases of use, because operator = and copy constructors of std::auto_ptr<T> transfer it value to left hand side std::auto_ptr<T>. It is very easy to get UB (undefined behavior, probably will be segmentation fault). The following code demonstrates it: Because of such behavior you should not use std::auto_ptr<T> in containers, e.g. std::vector<T>. They can use copying and assignment which will break your code. Also keep in mind that std::auto_ptr<T> is not smart pointer which has reference counting. For accessing managed object of std::auto_ptr<T> you can use: As you can see there are a lot of choices, but generally you will use -> to access managed object. Last methods of std::auto_ptr<T> which I haven’t mentioned before are: One more issue with std::auto_ptr<T> in that it suits only for single objects, because it calls operator delete in its destructor. You can't keep arrays in it. If you try doing it, you will face UB. It will likely leak or cause segmentation fault. See: For allocating an array of objects you must use std::vector<T> and some tricks with it. std::vector<T> and arrays or std::vector<T> is more than you think Standardized implementation of std::vector<T> says that std::vector<T> is a sequence container and its elements are stored contiguously. It means that if user obtains address of the first element in std::vector<T> it will be the same as a pointer to dynamic array, so it has same behavior as usual pointer to dynamic array. Also std::vector<T> can reserve necessary amount of memory to store data through method std::vector::resize(std::size_t). As a result you can use it like dynamic array. Check it out: In such way function handleDynamicArray() will work like with usual dynamic array, but in fact its memory is managed by std::vector<T> and memory will be emptied when std::vector<T> goes out of scope. You can forget about deallocation of array memory and be saved from throwing exceptions. As for question about how to handle lifetime of dynamic array if it is obtained from other function\\method. Again we can change std::vector<T> to necessary size, use std::copy() for copying array content and free original array. See: Maybe it looks a little bit strange and not efficient because of extra copying (std::copy), but mostly it is better than managing dynamic arrays manually. For two-dimensional array you can use std::vector<T> in std::vector<T>, like this: Unfortunately you won't be able to pass it as int** to some function\\method, but you still can copy obtained int** array via std::copy function. If you are really interested in matrices, you should better try to search some library with such container or implement your own in RAII way. Conclusion In this article I have described RAII idiom in C++ language. There are reviewed ways of avoiding usage of pointers without C++11 standard with help of std::auto_ptr<T> and std::vector<T>. Article provides good explanation for each case of their usage. In the next article I will review what C++11 standard has for accomplishing goal of my topic.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "top-10-rules-for-better-git-workflow", "author": ["Nikita Semenistyi"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/05/23/top-10-rules-for-better-git-workflow/", "abstract": "For quite a long time version control systems have been staying irreplaceable tool for software development artisans. They allow smooth team work, keep the history of changes and make the continuous integration and deployment possible. But in order for VCS to become a silver bullet, your team should have definitive set of rules of interaction within it. Here are my top 10 that may be applied to TFS, SVN or most of the other systems, yet the main target is Git: 1. Create feature branches. It is better to start implementing new major features in a new branch, this will allow you to keep master branch stable and synchronized with your application in production. You will still have a possibility to fix urgent bugs and make minor best throw pillows to master without fear of unwanted changes. Branch name should exactly represent the changes branch was created for and may consist of not only the name but also some sort of namespace (‘add/registration’). It is also very important always to keep the repository in the working state. Sometimes you may need to pause your work, but still you would want to resume it from a different workspace. This may be the case when you need to create your own branch containing pending changes. 2. Give commits sane messages and descriptions. It is very important to name commits properly in order not to spend the whole lifetime looking through git log’s output. Convention of many open-source projects is to place an infinitive in the beginning of the message (‘add’, ‘remove’, ‘update’). In the big projects namespaces also may be handy. Being the first word, they will give you an idea of which part was changed in this commit (‘report: add total field’). I personally prefer lower-cased sentences, but many projects choose regular sentence case instead. 3. Single responsibility of commit. One of the most important rules for me is that changes made in commit should solve just one problem. This rule guarantees you a clean history of commits and gives possibility to name each commit exactly according to its content. It is always weird to see server-side core changes under commit message ‘update html template’ and I believe, you know what I’m talking about. Besides, this rule gives you a chance to safely revert separate commits without any fear of breaking any parts of application you are not aware of. Another point is to commit code style changes in separate commit. This may be spaces to tabs change or windows line endings to Unix one, still these changes deserve their own commit. 4. Look through pending diff before performing a commit. I always thought of this rule as a good one, but recently I have made it mandatory for myself. It is very common to change some configuration rules while testing certain features of your app, and the chances are that you will not bring them back. Furthermore, this rule will allow you to cover all the pending changes you’ve made in order to evaluate them and give your commit corresponding message. That’s why I advise you to always see diffs before the commit. Seriously, always. 5. Avoid committing unneeded files. I hope, that absolute majority of you is aware of .gitignore file which is there to contain the list of files, folders or wildcards which will not be pushed to repository. The first group of such files would be module dependencies which should not be added to repository, but instead installed via packet manager (npm, NuGet, composer etc.). Another group is configuration files for text editors and another development environment programs. I personally always add *sublime* wildcard to gitignore as other team members don’t use Sublime Text editor and these files are useless for them. The basic .gitignore files for different languages and environments could be found here: https://github.com/github/gitignore . 6. Reference issues in commit messages. Both of the most popular social coding platforms implement interface of mentioning issues within commit messages (e.g. ‘fix typo. Relates to #4’). There is also more advanced way of referencing – you can use form of verb close (‘close’, ‘closed’, ‘closing’ etc.) in order to actually close the issue in the tracker (‘add authentication. Close #43’). Even if you have no such integration of VCS into issue tracker, I still advise you to reference issues in commit messages, which will allow you in future to match the commit to a specific issue either manually or with help of some script. 7. Use hooks. Git allows possibility of implementing hooks for quite a variety of events (pre-commit, post-commit, post-checkout etc.) and it may be very helpful if you take advantage of them. The most popular among them is pre-commit hook which allows us to insert some build actions or checks before the actual commit will take place. There are plenty of git hooks bindings for different build systems, here is the one for Grunt on Node.js ( https://github.com/rhumaric/grunt-githooks ) which allows you to assign hook name to Grunt tasks. 8. Use cli aliases. I love git’s cli and prefer to use it most of times while performing active operations (commit, push, checkout etc.). There is a chance that you’ll get tired of typing the same command on and on and that’s when you find your life-saver represented by git aliases. 9. IDE integration. In the previous rule I mentioned my love for cli git interface, but it may be extremely useful to have the integration of some operations like blame or diff view into your IDE. Not long ago I’ve discovered a brilliant package for Sublime Text ( https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git ), which includes most of the functionality you will need. 10. Tagging. You may not be aware that gitallows tagging, which may be used to mark the certain moment in your application development. Most people use it to flag releases and it can be utilized in future by different tools. For example, GitHub has first-class support for git tags and allows one to download each archived release: It is also used by some package managers (e.g. bower) to allow the user to download a certain version of a package. Git is a very powerful version control system which offers you a lot of functionality. It is definitely better to learn it thoroughly so that it becomes your friend, otherwise it can bring you lots of troubles.

To be sure that user’s browser supports IndexedDB we need to perform some kind of check. In particular, we can call the following code: While IndexedDB is currently in Candidate Recommendation stage some browsers can use vendor prefixes. Browser vendors may have another implementation differing from standard IndexedDB API until the moment when unified standard is applied. Nevertheless, till then you can use following check for testing in various browsers with different prefixes: This implementation is not recommended for Production. To start working with any DB we should previously open it. All processes start with such request: This request doesn’t open connection to database instantly due to the fact that work with database is asynchronous. In previously mentioned case we will have instance of IDBOpenDBRequest that has three eventhandlers: Onerror is called when error occurred and as argument the object of error is passed. Onsuccess is fired when database was opened successfully and the instance of opened database is returned as a result. Onupgrageneeded is called when the instance of database hasn’t yet been created or its version has been changed. This request handler should contain any manipulation with db’s inner structure – create/edit/delete ObjectStores, create indexes and so on. There is a function that opens (or creates) the database with name “MyDB” and version “3”, creates Object store with name “name”  and key-value “myKey”, and in case of success the callback is called. In its parameters the instance of opened DB is passed. You can see below the result of this method’s execution. As you have may noticed the result’s type is IDBDatabase . Among its properties you can see the database name and its version. Google chrome contains excellent tools for management of storages including IndexedDB. They are to be found in Developer Tools (F12) in tab Resources. There you can see all the available information concerning database, its version, name, accessible collections and data inside. As soon as Object Stores are ready, you can start working with them. In the IndexedDB one has possibility to store data as it is. There are also transactions in IndexedDB, that guarantee atomicity of operations in it since all reading and writing operations are combined into transaction. Due to this fact either all operations will be executed successfully or nor of them will and the database will not appear in undefined partly updated state. This method is called by transaction. As argument you should give the ObjectStore and access mode (there are two modes available: readonly and readwrite). For example: Try not to use readwrite mode when you do not actually need it. Request above will return object of type IDBTransaction that has few event handlers. From this object you can also achieve access to existing object stores.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "insideout-saveliy", "author": ["Diana Ivanova"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/08/08/insideout-saveliy/", "abstract": "I am always curious how people chose their way in life. So, my first question is: “Why did you become a developer?” I don’t think I really know how I became a developer. I think I should start with short preview of my life before I had to make this kind of a choice. In my kindergarten my parents understood that I was good at different sciences, inparticularly math, which is always connected to informatics. Most of the times if you do well in math you can work as a developer. But in real life I had lots of proofs that it might be different: it is possible to be good at humanities but still write good code. When I was in 2nd or 3d grade (I don’t really remember for sure) my parents took me swimming and that was the time when I started doing sports in my life. I mean, my extracurricular activities weren’t connected to programming, but sport taught me a lot in life  and that turned out to be helpful in  my current work. It gives you the understanding that you should work hard and monotonous to achieve the results you want. I did swimming up to my university years. We used to go to different competitions with our university team, so it was really interesting and exciting. I liked the practice itself. Of course, it was never easy, I always had to struggle. I mean figuratively speaking I had to “die” (work as hard as possible) during the practice to get the feeling of full satisfaction in the end. Swimming in fact involves all muscles of your body, so when all of your muscles work hard you feel very relaxed after all. Swimming also played a huge role in my social development and further life. I was always in a group of kids, where we communicated a lot and had fun - so, I was never bored. During my university years it got even better – all the day you work hard studying (solve some problems, search for the solutions) and by the end of the day you lay yourself out during the swimming practice: your day is worth something. I always felt that I didn’t just waste my time. So, back to the question, until the 5 th grade nobody knew what specialty I would pick in the future. Did you have a dream of who you’d want to be? You mean like a lot of kids dream about being a spaceman?:) Nope. The same as my parents, until the 5 th grade I had no idea what I’d like to do in life. Then my parents bought me the computer and I got interested in computer games. I liked to work with 3d design and 3d graphics – it was interesting to do some sketches, some animated work. I always liked to be creative. I never thought that I would become a developer right until the university. In my 11 th grade I faced the necessity to choose where to go, what university to pick. I liked working on the computer and I thought that it was very perspective job. Of course, I also want to advance my knowledge in other spheres of life – but I haven’t figured out in what way yet. I think it will be connected with management or combination of development and design. What other interests do you have in life except the programming? Any hobbies? I always liked to read books. Actually my dad reads a lot, I guess I took it from him. I remember he used to read fantasy, so I also read some of those books we had at home.  I understood that fantasy is not just an action – it also has some deep meaning (in feelings, ideas). You really can learn a couple of lessons from those books. Until the graduation from school I liked this genre. Now I chose a little bit different books- something connected to psychology. It is a way to understand people, their emotions, and the world around you – why people act in one way or another. Of course, it is sport - I can’t imagine my life without it. It is a kind of a habit and it will never change. Here, in Uzhgorod, I don’t go to swimming pool, but I am working on it. At the moment it is better for me to spend half an hour in the morning to jog than to keep all my evening busy with swimming. This way I still do sports, but I also have free evening to do other things I like. So, how did you find out about Binary Studio? It was impossible not to know since we have professional managers who do great marketing job here. I saw this bright orange poster hanging on the wall in my university. There was some information about the Binary Studio Academy organized that time. I thought: “Why not?” The areas they offered were .Net, PHP and C++. Of course, I was thinking about .NET, but I also wasn’t against C++. By the time I applied to the academy I had decided to write in C# rather than in C++. Since I made a decision to get into the academy I was ready to do my best to bring this idea to life. My first though on how to increase my chances of getting the spot in the academy was: “I know C++ and .NET. I had some experience in both. So, I have to learn PHP which I had never worked with.” I knew there were going to be tests, so I had to pass all: C++, .NET and PHP.  I started to read a book “PHP for dummies”. But, I didn’t have good examples of code or any experience in it, so I didn’t like working with PHP. But now I understand that those were just my emotions and PHP is not as bad as it seemed at that moment. So, I passed tests and was invited to the interview for the Academy. Studying there I made a decision to start working. The project I worked on was very interesting – we had to write a WPF clients that would connect to the remote ventilation unit through the GSM module and would read different indications from that ventilation unit. So, we learned a lot: how to work with GSM module; how to set up the connection using GPRS – it was awesome. I mean the Academy was not less interesting. I had a really cool coach – Roma who gave me a lot of knowledge I have now. After the Academy Binary Studio made an offer to stay for a developer position which I did. You said the project was very interesting. What are you criteria of an interesting project? What does interesting project mean to you –? Well… First of all it depends on the person – for everyone the criteria might be different. But if to speak from my point of view: project is interesting when you can learn something new, try new tricks working on it. I like when I can show not only my knowledge in development from the angle of architecture, logic, code writing, but also use some creativity. Interesting work doesn’t always mean different projects all the time. You can work on the same project, but the tasks you perform may be very different. If you have to look for unusual solutions all the time - it is not a monotonous work anymore. So, you always have to make various decisions which is a process of self-development. What do you like at Binary Studio? The atmosphere – the feeling that you are part of a big family. When there are a lot of people in the company you might get lost among them. And in Binary Studio I feel that I am needed here and I am connected with everything going on inside the company. As an example, let’s go back to the story about the Academy. All the lectures are handled by the employees from Binary Studio. I even did get a chance to deliver one lecture during the Academy this year and it was awesome. There are also a lot of other activities like hang-outs and so on. For every person it is important to know that you are valuable for the company. You work to benefit and the company appreciates it! Also we have very interesting people working here and this is a big plus. All of us are different and at the same time cool and fun. It is interesting to work with such people any time of the day! Can you share with us some flashback from your life? I have a lot of memories to think of actually. But one has just popped up in my mind and I can share it with you. My grandfather from my mother’s side once told me a very interesting and wise phrase and I still remember and use it in my life. I was studying in school and was very upset because of something: wasn’t really in the mood. Here is what he told me: “You should never think about how hard the situation is. What you should do is to think about the various solutions for this problem - this way you will be much closer to figuring out the problem.” A lot of times in my life I went back to that moment in my mind and used this advice. And you know what – it always worked. I don’t know, let’s use swimming as an example. You have a distance - 2km and, no matter what, you have to do it and fit the time frames. There is a feeling that you don’t even want to start, because it is impossible. So, what I used to do was I thought: “So what? Just start swimming and see how it goes. If you can’t finish it – well at least you’ve tried.” You keep on swimming; it is very exhausting – but you don’t think about how many km you have left – you just continue trying. In the end there is always a result, it might not be the one you expected but it is more than nothing. That’s the memory that I always go back to - it helped me a lot in life. Those were just the right words told by the right man in the right moment of my life. Name 5 things that would characterize you as a person you are at the moment. Sport (1) - it is very important to me. (The swimmer on the picture is Saveliy himself.) If I do sport in the morning then I get the energy for the whole day. If we speak about evening sports then it is emotional boom – you kind of give away all the negative emotions gathered during the day and go to sleep in good mood. The second thing is a book (2) - I mean in general any book. As I’ve mentioned before I like reading a lot. I always have my e-book with me, so whenever I get some free time or get bored I read. I like to develop my knowledge, learn something new - not to stay at one point in life. My next thing would be my headphones and the phone (3) which I use as a Walkman. To be more specific I’d say it is music. It is like my hobby- when I walk somewhere or do some monotonous tasks and there no need to think then I listen to music. It helps me in distracting from everyday life and brings some colors into the world. Traveling (4) - the world is huge and many-sided. Every person has some model of understanding the world around, which influences everyday decisions and behavior. Traveling helps you broaden the horizons and see the world from different sides. You get the understanding that people may live differently than you used to and as a result you become more tolerant. I am not sure but I think that if more people had an opportunity to travel there might be less conflicts in the world. Traveling is interesting and useful for everyone. Fifth point I’d like to combine. I like people who are very sincere and spontaneous (5) - those are the features I try to work on in my character. When you speak to this kind of person you are 100 % sure that he/she is honest and wouldn’t lie or hide something from you. This person would always say what’s on his/her mind – wouldn’t exaggerate or try to meet your expectations. If something is wrong this person would tell you this. I think that every person should have this features. What priorities do you have in life? My main priority in life is self-development and not just in professional area but in life in general. The process is never-ending – you can’t be ideal, so you keep on learning and learning non-stop. I’d like to travel much more in the future. I also know that there should be more humor and positive attitude to life. I want to be a person who you can rely on; who can be trusted – so people wouldn’t be ashamed to know me. And the easiest question:) What did you have for lunch today? For lunch I had smiles of people I like, brightest summer sun and the cleanest air of UzhgorodJ (Saveliy didn’t tell us, but we know that he ate spaghetti).

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "gulpvsgrunt", "author": ["Kirill Buga"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/08/21/gulpvsgrunt/", "abstract": "For the current moment build systems are the inseparable part of any Front-End project. They allow to automate project’s assembling, compilation, minification, files’ linting, to start Unit-tests and much more. In February 2013 one of the most stable and popular build systems was born - Grunt. Grunt is command-line based instrument for assembling the projects, relying on consecutive tasks execution. Definition of this task should be done in a specific file Gruntfile.js, which should be a valid js file. From the first day of the release quantity of plugins for it increased and now this number is around 2000+. In many articles it is mentioned that to write Grunt’s plugin is easier than to read it and it is so. To be able to make configuration file all you need is to read documentation where you can find templates ready to injection into your project. However, grasping already configured one can be tricky. Just imagine - you start working with a Grunt project that contains 20+ plugins, and all of them are in a mutual dependency and should be executed in some order. One of the simplest configurations is provided below. Although, when the application grows your configuration file may become more like this . It’s very easy to understand, isn't it? The performance is probably a bottle-neck of Grunt. When the Grunt was released no-one was thinking about multi-threading, caching and other methods for speeding up assembling. However, the biggest problem is in multithreaded data-processing. Usually one actions order is connected to the same database but grunt knows nothing about this and uses separate in/out thread for each task (each time reads files, executes for them some operation, saves results back to the hard-drive). This situation happens for each task, thus we are wasting a lot of resources when we could be using only one thread for all the tasks. At the moment some attempts are made to provide multithreading for Grunt (grunt-concurrent) and to use caching (grunt-newer), but it looks more like crutches than a good coding solution. Recently new build-system was released  - gulp.js, that occurs to be a right alternative to Grunt. what is the main difference? Gulp is build on thread-based conception of data-processing. It allows to avoid temporary files/folders and to flush information to hard-drive. All operations are executed in operative memory, thus a process can become 10 times faster. Unlike Grunt you should set src only for tasks that will use concrete files allowing to execut file in/output only once which makes it faster. Gulp uses multi-threading as default mode, so all tasks will be running in separate threads. Configuration should be done according to CommonJs so it is easier to read and understand. Here is an example of the same configuration but for Gulp. As you may have noticed, the configuration file is based on pipeline in the best Unix-traditions. Configuration Gulp file.js is accurate and readable due to a good-structured source code. As to the existing plugins Gulp still looses Grunt in their quantity, but this situation won’t last long. There are 200 plugins for Gulp and this number increases. There is a plugin for porting Grunt plugins to Gulp (gulp-grunt), which allows running the Grunt plugins in the Gulp projects. It’s hard to predict Grunt development in the future. According to the latest gossips developers are going to improve performance of Grunt, but on my opinion it is dying, and problem is not in quality of this product, but in architecture that won’t give it a possibility to compete with other more modern systems. Gulp is a breath of fresh air in modern build systems. I do like direction and development speed of this project, and hope that it will replace Grunt afterwards.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "insideout-artem", "author": ["Diana Ivanova"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/09/15/insideout-artem/", "abstract": "Tell us a little bit about yourself. Well… I am 29 years old and I’ve been with Binary Studio for almost 10 years. We started this company with Anton in 2005 studying in Donetsk National University (Math Faculty). If to speak about hobbies starting from my childhood I extremely liked football: I mean literally everything about football - I like to watch the Championships and to play in real time and at Sony PlayStation of course 🙂 What club is your favorite? Shahtar-Donetsk used to be my favorite club, but due to the political situation… I mean I still like it, but not as much as before. Out of European clubs I think I can choose Arsenal – London. Did you think about devoting your life to football? When I was little I used to skip classes at school to play football, so all I had in my back pack was a T-shirt, shorts and snickers. As a child I dreamt about becoming a football player, but something didn’t work well and I went to the university to study science. How did you choose to study science if you never wanted to? I can’t say I didn’t want to – I always had good grades (at school I was an “A” student). At that particular moment I thought about sports as something unreal (too competitive) – getting in is was extremely tough. It seemed that to build a good life by being a football player was next to impossible plus my parents insisted on going to the university. I graduated the school with Honors, so I had to continue studying. Math? Interesting choice. I chose Faculty of Math because…. To be honest I have no idea why I did that 🙂 Mathematics was never like a dream for me or something that I’d like to do, but it was a way to get the computer. When I was a child I really wanted a computer and most of my friends and classmates had one. For some reason I was so sure that when I enter the university my parents would buy me one. I’d be a student and they would have no other choice and that’s the reason I applied. Tell us about your student years. Was it a lot of fun? Frankly speaking the situation was very interesting - by the time all of my classmates entered the university some of them had already been programming, others at least read something about it and I didn’t have any idea on how to insert the floppy into computer 🙂 Of course, everybody laughed at me and I couldn’t understand why teachers never told us how to do that. What about your first job as a developer? First, let me tell you how I got that job. I saw an ad at the dormitory: guys with some development knowledge needed.  I decided to call them and I was invited to the interview. When I arrived I saw the sign: “Funeral Services” on the building which got me really confused. I walked around the house, looked for the right company (there were no cell phones yet, so I couldn’t call) and couldn’t find it, so I had no other choice but to enter that strange building. The house appeared to be divided in two parts – at one side there were funeral services and at the other the company I was looking for. What exactly was your project about? It was one of the Startups in Donetsk at that moment – Andrey and Stas (two brothers) organized it. We were working on one of the first real estate databases in Ukraine. At those times: in 2002-2003 when the internet - 256 KB was a real win, I used to save HTML pages to take the floppy/usb home to read offline. So, they had an idea to build a database for the real estate agencies of course nothing of the kind ever existed in Ukraine. I was responsible for development of the application – offline database - since the internet was not used so widely. We developed a system and it is still being used nowadays. I mentioned my private e-mail there and I still receive letters with support inquiries etc. How many people were on your team? I was already working there as a developer when the project was expanded, so I called Anton who I knew from the dormitory and invited him to join. I am still very glad that I met him and we started working together, because he is very smart and responsible. Despite all the other things as a partner he is very reliable. It would be impossible for me to find such a great person as Anton. I think that but for his support and sarcastic attitude we would have never built this company. From the very beginning the team consisted of 5 developers including us, as one of the most experienced I was promoted to a Project Manager (we all were students). Why did you decide to work with foreigners? At some point I got the feeling that I have to move on. Somehow our (my and Anton’s) economic gut lead us to look for customers abroad. That was the time when I made a decision to start working with foreigners. I surfed Internet for a while, read a lot of forums where we found our first customer from Finland (we are still working with this customer) – that’s how our company started. What was the company like at the very b eginning? Our first office was a simple 2 bedroom apartment actually. In the morning Anton would go to open the door for guys while brushing his teeth. I didn’t really see that because I was still living in the dormitory - some time later I also moved to that apartment. We were working at one part of the apartment and living in the other one. In the end of the working day we would all meet up to watch football together and to drink beers. I‘d say the challenge to build and grow the company at some point became one of the main motivations for me, as also the development of IT in the region. Why did you decide to develop IT in your region? Did you think about moving to other city? The situation with IT companies was terrible, there was actually just one company everybody knew and it wasn’t providing the high quality services, so not a lot of talented guys wanted to work for them. A lot of my friends had to move to Kiev or other cities for this reason – I didn’t like that.  So we started looking for projects and offered them to our acquaintances (2 of my stream mates are still working with me).  We started in the university, but at some point decided to grow and expand. What do you like at Binary Studio now? People – atmosphere. From the beginning we wanted to create a place for work/place for fun environment. We wanted it to be something really cool and fun for people. I was comparing everything with one of my previous jobs (McDonalds) which was a very negative experience in my life. Why was it so bad? There was a huge misunderstanding between regular employees and the management team – they were Gods and we were “nothing”. I knew that I had to change something, bring in some friendly attitude, however it never worked out. I didn’t like working there not because of a small salary or tough schedule, but due to this entirely unfriendly atmosphere. It was more like exchanging my time for money – that wasn’t something I wanted in my life. At my next job (real estate project) I kind of had a chance to build a great team. However, since I wasn’t the head manager I didn’t have all the rights to influence the company. So, when we built our company as a place for work/ place for fun I finally had a chance to create everything the way I wanted – and up until now I like when the company organizes some corporate trips, parties or celebrations. I like when people feel comfortable in the company – what the most important is spirit. I could say that the main goal of our company is to build the spirit. Can you share with us some bright memory from your life? I don’t know why (maybe because I am very tired now) but the first thing that comes to my mind is my vacation at Philippines. It was a very cool reboot of consciousness – first of all - Asian culture, second – sun and water. They are a kind of new democratic society.  As a tourist I didn’t have to worry at, all – problems disappeared. It is the place where I’d like to spend more than just a week: a heaven on the Earth. This memory is the brightest one the past…hmm…. a lot of years. Can you name 5 things that you can’t imagine your life without? Something that would characterize your personality at the moment? Car (1) – it gives me freedom: I can always get in the car and drive wherever I want. It is more like a way to overcome the distance: if I want to go to the sea I just jump in my car and go there. What I enjoy a lot is driving abroad – the roads are amazing. How do feel about car brands? I don’t think it matters much for me now – there were times when I liked German cars then Japanese. By now I get the understanding of being “ok” with any car as long as it is safe. I am not fond of repairing cars – it is not my hobby at all, so when I buy car- I buy freedom, not slavery. What are the other 4 things that matter for you? Laptop (Mac). I’ve never considered buying a Mac (2) before and this one I got as a present for my birthday from Anton. However, now I am in love with this laptop and not because of the brand, but because the battery holds up to 8 hours. If there was some other laptop with more powerful battery (10 hours charge) I would consider buying it, because this is my freedom. I also like traveling a lot and considering this fact I could name my third thing – my passport for going abroad (3). Actually, I’ve got a couple of those. PlayStation (4) – 95% of the playing time I chose football (FIFA) as I’ve told you before I like it a lot. Next - my headphones with noise reduction (5), I can’t imagine my flights without these headphones, because they help me abstract from screaming kids behind and plane noises – so I can always get some rest in a quiet atmosphere. What are your main priorities in life? Freedom – freedom of thoughts, actions, movement. If you ask me to name one thing that I’d like a lot (apart from regular things like health and so on) it’d be no visas anywhere in the world. I’d like to have an opportunity to travel to other countries without any issues like getting a visa – that’s my main concern. I like doing things I enjoy. I could say that I am a happy person because starting from my company I do what I like. I come to work and see people I am happy to meet who are like my family and I feel very comfortable here emotionally which is another of the main priorities in my life. As a conclusion I could say that atmosphere is extremely important for me… I love working with interesting people who motivate me. The easiest question of all – what did you have for lunch? 🙂 I had fried eggs with bacon, salad with cucumbers and tomatoes. Drinks - kvass and Americano, plus on top of all that I ate an ice cream.

Our CEO Artem Goncharov who’s recently moved to Silicon Valley and is currently doing his MBA program at UC Berkeley attended UTGEM. Artem shares his impressions about the event: “The atmosphere of the event was exceptional; the rooms were filled with patriotic symbolics, people wearing national cloths (vishivankas). Such atmosphere made me believe I was back home. The exhibition hall included company presentation stalls, startup and VC alleys. They also organized demonstration of Ukrainian tech products, that’s how I tested Petcube ! Unfortunately I didn’t have a chance to spend a whole day, so I listened just to a few talks by Torben Majgaard from Ciklum and CEO of Epam. Ruslana was extremely proactive and open, talking to people her main point was to understand what she could do to help Ukrainian IT.” We hope that events of such kind will become a tradition and thus Ukraine will become well known worldwide as a tech gem of the Europe.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "backbone-course-review", "author": ["Anton Vasilenko"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/10/23/backbone-course-review/", "abstract": "Hello, everyone. Here I’d like to share my thoughts and impressions about the JS courses I’ve recently attended in Binary Studio Academy PRO . The idea of the course was to introduce modern tools, frameworks and approaches that are highly popular now among front-end developers. I should also note that primarily I’m a .Net Developer and don’t spend lots of time on front-end tasks at my projects. That was one of reasons why I decided to attend this course: so that I can learn something new about the stuff that appears to be always somewhere near the dotnet stack from now on. First lecture was about most popular js-specific patterns which may seem to be simple at first sight but which have proven their usefulness during further hometasks. Yeah, each lecture was followed by a hometask that we were to complete till next lecture. That was one of the keys, why this course had real effect. Only when you get your hands dirty with something you can say that (a) you’ve learned it, (b) you liked it and finally that (c) you will use it in future. Otherwise it’s just nice time spending with colleagues. Second lecture was an introduction to existing tools, libraries and design patterns that are in front-end development. MVC, MVVM, 2-way binding, AMD and other serious words mixed with library names were on the slides. The idea was to show that there are many approaches to structure and modularize your web-application. The main point was that you SHOULD structure it to reduce problems of maintaining constantly growing codebase along the project lifetime. Your choice may depend on scale and difficulty of your project. Next several lectures were about Backbone JS as one of the most popular and well-proven front-end framework nowadays. Its idea of having only Views and Models was strange at first glance, because in .Net world we accustomed that design pattern abbreviation that starts with MV-prefix should be followed by some other capital letters, like MVC, MVP or MVVM. Apparently Backbone JS gives you freedom in choosing how you would use these models and views, which is one of its features - not to tie you to strict paradigm that you will eventually bypass. As the framework is highly supported by open-source community and has great potential for extensibility, it has lots of plugins already available to meet your most popular needs. Libraries for local storage support, caching model data, saving model states, configuration of validation were introduced during lecture and tested afterwards within home tasks. The advantage of Backbone is that it doesn’t force you to some specific way of rendering the view. Although it provides the default template engine, you can and should still use additional libraries to simplify and organize view rendering. So next lectures have covered two most popular libraries for processing views  -Marionette and Thorax. Both of them use template engine to process html views from given data thus reducing the boilerplate code of writing rendering logic from scratch. At the end of the course we’ve built the simple film catalogue with master-detail views powered by Backbone + Marionette or Thorax + several Backbone plugins. Several key points that I’ve learned from the course: I will definitely consider using Backbone.js in my future projects, though we should always remember that any framework is a silver bullet and we must use it wisely. Backbone with view library is very convenient for complex web-solutions that could constantly require some tuneup, render optimizations, etc. For simple projects, like several pages with CRUD operations over business entities without tight limitations on response speed, frameworks like Angular JS will suit better. Our lector Nikita promised us that this will be the subject of his next course, so I’m looking forward to it.", "date": "2017-02-09"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "indexed-db-part-iii", "author": ["Kirill Buga"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2015/06/15/indexed-db-part-iii/", "abstract": "Earlier I described IndexedDB in general overview and examined examples of practical IndexedDb usage. This article is continuation of previous and consists of two main parts. The first one is dedicated to usage of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The second part is about cursors that allow reading of big volumes of data and creating indexes for increasing performance while executing transaction. One of the most popular operations is adding objects to collection. For this purpose there is method “add” in ObjectStore with two parameters. The first is the object to be added, and the second (optional) – value of primary key, which uniquely identifies it in the collection. On creation of ObjectStore I passed key with name “myKey”, that is why instead of passing the second argument we can set key value directly inside of the object. Adding is asynchronous operation, and that is why we have handlers defined for success and error. After this code’s execution there will be new record added to the storage. In console, you will see following message - \"Object was successfully added\". If we’ll look on contents of database, you will find added previously object there. During creation, we have set up that unique key for the storage is field “myKey”. That is why for each record value in myKey should be unique. Let us try to call that code once again. Due to hard-coded value in our example for the field“myKey” script will try to add new record with now non-unique value. You will see following error message: \"Error ConstraintError\". ConstraintError means that we were trying to add record with already present key, what is exactly the case. Let us talk now about keys . They are nothing else but primary keys analogues from relational databases world. Even though IndexedDB does not store data in tables each record should have unique key , which should be used by database in order to be able to work with it. One of possible ways of organizing this is by manual setting of primary key. The second variant is key auto-generation. Thus, IndexedDB will generate unique value for primary key when it does not contain key already. To switch the auto-generation on you should pass { autoIncrement: true } as the second parameter during creation, for example: Let’s check how it works. As we know all operations on database-schema change should be executed in onupgradeneeded , which can be called by updating version of database. Let’s change the version of database and create new Object Store with name «test». Now we try to add two objects with the same values in key-field. Let’s have a look at the contents of database, there is object in ObjectStore with name “test” which contains two records and each of them contains unique key. Now when we are clear with keys let’s move to data access. Similarly to adding there is possibility of reading/removing and updating of data. To read data from storage you should create transaction, achieve access to the Object Store needed and call method get , passing key of element to be retrieved as argument for this method. Retrieved object can be found in «target.result» of resulting objects. For tests on ObjectStore “test” few new records were added. Below is the result of retrieving object with key “5” To update data in storage you can use method put , also called on any ObjectStore object. There is also possible update by key. Retrieved record can be changed and after that updated in the storage. Below is the example of such action: Do not forget that updated object should contain key field, or it will be added to storage as a new instance. To delete object from database you should use delete on ObjectStore instance. As argument, it gets key of removable object. Here is an example: For reading of big volumes of data, there is cursor in IndexedDB. It allows us to get collection of records with possibility to iterate them. You can create cursor for any ObjectStore object, just calling method openCursor() . Below you can find example: And finally let’s look at index creation . Indexes are one of the most important part of IndexedDB and let find data in storage based on their values and properties. Also using indexes you can set whether object’s value should be unique in the storage. First of all we should create index. Indexes are part of database schema – that is why they should be created in onupgradeneeded handler. There is example of index creation: First parameter in method createIndexis a name of index, and the second – field being indexed. Third parameter is the object of parameters that will set configuration for index. In our case, it is set that for field “first_name” there should be unique values. When you try to add instance with the same value in this field there will be an error. How can you use it during requests? If index exists you can get it by calling index() on ObjectStore . Basically so we can use index for iterating through storage. To do it you should first call index() and then openCursor(). There was used another way to get access to Database. It is called chaining . You can chain in such a manner transaction-creation, access to ObjectStore and execution of request. You can use this when you have no need in storing the temporary objects. But also you lose possibility to handle errors occurred in-between. That’s why there should be global error handler and you can implement it subscribing on onerror event of IDBDatabase . Above I’ve described possible ways of indexes' usage to achieve values based on some particular property. But what if we want to iterate through collection only partially? in this case we'll use ranges in IndexedDB . Ranges allow us to get indexes' subset. Let’s have a look on example. Supposedly, we have collection with clients' info and we are going to collect statistics regarding persons from 23 to 30 years old. In this case, we'll use range with lower boundary set to 23 and the higher one - to 30. Ranges are being created within global object IDBKeyRange. It has three methods for setting boundary conditions on search. As soon as range is created you can pass it as argument to the openCursor(). In this case, it will return iterator that runs using index limited by range. Then task of iteration by age for ObjectStore will have following view: IndexedDB is a nice tool for datastorage on client-side and building the autonomy web-applications. It is supported by the most part of modern browsers and has good documentation and API. All operations are executed asynchronously. The main flaw of IndexedDB is a lack of support on mobile platforms, but it can also be resolved with the usage of different wrappers. 1. http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/working-with-indexeddb--net-34673 2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB 3. http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/ Kirill started programming career with .Net, but later fell in love with JavaScript.

However, I have seen lots of people suffering from cmd and not knowing about the magic of ConEmu. So, I decided to describe it briefly in my article. Absence of a good terminal and a good shell with useful and easy commands in Windows was always a pain and a subject of misunderstanding. I believe, that Unix will be always winning in the area of commands as it was initially designed for it. Though Windows created PowerShell, which also has lots of features like C# support, it is without any doubt much less popular and more difficult. The question of creating good terminal was raised and while guys from Microsoft waited until someone will create a program, which could have possibility of remote administration - the task which can be handled by shell very well, Maximus5 created a grand terminal called ConEmu . Brilliant, isn’t it? To be honest, after switching from cmd to ConEmu, you feel love and care, which developer putted into this software. ConEmu supports multiple tabs view and screen split: It allows you to configure the view of the console to be exactly the same as you think of it. As you can see on the throw pillows sale, different color themes were applied to different screen parts (which are completely independent consoles). In order to split screen you should just check ‘New console split’ and choose options: ‘Left / bottom’ and size of the screen to be taken in %. Apart from the visual, ConEmu allows you to use any shell which you want, for example MinGW or Putty. This is how Putty support can be added: 1. Save connection in Putty. 2. Go to settings of ConEmu -> Startup - > Tasks and add new one. 3. Type: putty.exe –new_console –load ‘’. I’ve described just a few features of ConEmu, though it has hundreds of functions and visual design enhancements. I strongly advise you to install it and finally feel the supremacy of perfect console design.

Code examples are written on C# using Xamarin platform. What is pairing? In order to secure communication between devices and prevent unauthorized access, device playing peripheral role may enable characteristic protection. If peripheral device enabled protection for characteristic, you need to pair with device in order to access characteristic values. Pairing is done through means of alert dialog, asking you to enter secure code. This code is provided by peripheral device you want to pair with, and is generated each time pairing is requested. Pairing initiation Android shows pairing dialog on first unauthorized access to peripheral characteristic. For example you may try to read secured characteristic value of peripheral. In this case OnCharacteristicRead callback would return status: GattStatus.InsufficientAuthentication , after which pairing process will be started. There are two variants of showing pairing dialog. First is when system shows it on top of the current application view as you have seen on the previous screenshot. Second variant requires clicking on pairing request message in android notification area. Now, there is no direct way to force android show pairing dialog using one of the described variants. Sometimes, it is shown directly, sometimes from notification area. So be ready to inform user to check notification area if it is not shown on top of the current activity. Observing pairing state There are situations when you would like to know from your code the result of pairing. To do so you have to register receiver of BluetoothDevice.ActionBondStateChanged event. To register we need to pass BroadcasReceiver object, overriding OnReceive method, called during pairing procedure. We can use OnReceive to observe pairing state in the following way: Pairing process starts with state Bonding . After you entered pairing code and pressed ok button inside pairing dialog, it can be changed from Bonded (in case of success) or None (in case of failure). Pressing Cancel button on pairing dialog can lead to strange behaviour. Logically it should trigger bonding state change to None . Unfortunetely, on my Nexus 7 and Nexus 5 devices it changes bonding state to Bonded . Hope, it would be fixed in the next android firmware versions. After pairing is done, you should unregister receiver: Peripheral role (GATT server) After android has introduced in 4.3 version BLE support, quickly became clear that support is not full. Things haven’t changed in 4.4 version. The insufficiency is that you cannot advertise when your application plays peripheral role. What does it mean? It means that devices playing central role cannot see you as a peripheral and therefore establish connection. However, there is a workaround to make your android device visible as a BLE-server to other device. Your android smartphone should be in both BLE client and server mode. Device to which it connects, must know beforehand about services smartphone provide as a server. In the moment of connection client saves information about you, and use it later to work with you as a server. It can be done only one a low level of BLE protocol implementation, so you cannot do this from another Android device using existing Bluetooth API. Initializing GATT Server To enable BLE peripheral role, we need to open GATT server using BluetoothManager instance, through OpenGattServer() method: To observe BLE events as a server, we pass BluetoothGattServerCallback class implementation as a second parameter of OpenGattServer method. The approach is similar to one we used in first article with BluetoothGattCallback. Here is the example of gattObserver implementation: These are not all callbacks, but they can be considered as main ones. Each callback is triggered in a response to corresponding BLE events, described further in the article. Services of GATT Server After GATT server is opened, you need to add services used by clients to retrieve data. Let’s create a service that will allow clients to write us some data and read them. Firstly, we need to create characteristics that we would later associate with service. In the constructor we pass characteristic UUID address, type of characteristic and client permissions. So, we specified one write characteristic allowing client to write us data, without waiting for response. Also, we will add read characteristic allowing client to read data, but only if it is paired with our smartphone, because of encryption . Next step is to created service and associate our characteristics with it: Finally, we can add created service to GATT server: This would trigger OnServiceAdded callback indication whether operation was successful. Interaction with client-device When client device connects or disconnects from server, OnConnectionStateChange callback is triggered, providing connected/disconnected device, connection state and status. When client sends a write request OnCharacteristicWriteRequest callback is triggered. If client anticipates response, to know whether write command was successful or not, we call SendResponce method of BluetoothGattServer . In the same way we can receive and handle characteristic read requests, descriptor write/read requests. Unfortunately, you cannot receive and handle characteristic notify requests, as it is not yet supported by Android versions 4.3 and 4.4. Finale In the last part of this article series you have learned about pairing between BLE devices and how it is done on Android, how make Android device play peripheral role and how receive and handle client data requests. All code examples presented in this article are used in a demo project, which you can download here .", "date": "2017-02-09"},
{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "getting-started-with-reactjs", "author": ["Kirill Buga"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2015/08/04/getting-started-with-reactjs/", "abstract": "Today JS becomes more and more popular and the Front-end frameworks quantity grows dramatically. If you take a look at popular JS frameworks such as Backbone, Angular, Ember, you’ll notice that each one of them provides different abstraction level, implementation model and terminology. From this point of view React exceeded all the expectations. It was created by guys from Facebook and is used in Facebook and Instagram - unbelievable, isn’t it? It will definitely change your perception of Front-end implementation. Front-end coding is typically based on MVC pattern, where View is instance that renders text-templates into DOM-fragments. View displays data and reacts on user input and events. Data is stored in the Model. Change of Model leads to the change of View and this process is controlled by Controller. General model of this pattern is shown below. What makes React then so different? The thing is that View-part in React is replaced with so-called Component. It contains 2 instantiated objects: props (it stores unchangeable parameters passed during object’s creation) and state (it contains current state of the component and can be changed upon to some conditions). Well-known fact is that the most consuming operation in Front-end applications is call the DOM-tree. And React’s main distinction is that during View’s rendering it doesn’t construct physical DOM directly from templates. First of all it creates some temporal (virtual) DOM, compares it to real alongside with creation of Diffs, and only then makes call to DOM. Thus React closes access for the developer to DOM-tree and decides on its own when and why call to DOM should be made. “WAT?”, you probably ask. But keep it calm and don’t panic because first of all access to the real DOM is possible although it is not recommended. Secondly React’s implementation of virtual DOM is really awesome, so this technic allows you to manipulate View quickly. Let’s go back to our Component which is the main React’s object. You can create complicated Web interfaces by combining Components. Each one of them implements render() where the temporary DOM is created and this rendering can be hierarchic. This way the Components tree is created. Each block contains of its current state and is re-rendered after any change. Changes in parent’s component are also passed to children. As interim DOM is a part of Component, react.js provides useful xml-like extension as JSX. It allows building components’ tree as a set of xml-nodes. Logic and markup are saved in the same file. There is also JSX->JS converter (that can be found on the official web-site). You can call conversion from command-line (for example using build-systems such as Grunt and Gulp) or execute it on-site, by adding special script to your page. Second method isn’t recommended to use in production, because it may slow-down your application. Let’s take a look at some implementation – ToDo List. It’s popular example that was implemented with all possible frameworks. Our application consists of 2 components – list of tasks and application itself. Here is the list: Pay attention to the first line /** @jsx React.DOM */. It informs JSX-parser about JSX content inside that needs to be parsed. Component has only one method – render(), that creates inside list of input parameters. In this case this.props data set that was passed during the creation. As you can see from example, you can manipulate Html-lines as JS-objects, since the output you’ll get will as shown below: It is completely valid JS_code. Each html-tag will be replaced during parcing with React’s method. This is how interim DOM is created and what allows you to keep markup and code together. As for application component it looks far more interesting: First of all, here you can see also other functions, some of them are standard others are custom. getInitialState(object) sets initial state of component. setState(object) changes the state and leads to render() being called. In render() of application we create task list with following code <TodoList items={this.state.items} />. As argument the list of items was passed. For parent component this list is state, but for child – it is props. Change of state in parent’s component will lead to re-rendering of child nodes. All attributes in React use camelCase notation, and all parameters are in braces. Compiled JS will be as follows. RenderComponent() creates and renders Component. Functions onChange and handleSubmit are normal callbacks to users’ actions. One more distinction of react is usage of artificial events that do not bound to real DOM objects. React delegates events and attaches itself to root (you can read about this here ). Each component also passes few states in its lifecycle and special callback exists for each of them. As an example when component will mount calls to the method componentWillMount(). Afterwards it calls to the componentDidMount(). There is a bunch of such callbacks but all of them follow this pattern – componentWill* methods are called before state’s change, and componentDid* methods - after. Here are some of examples: All lifecycle of the component is as follows: Main thing you must remember is that data is passed from parent to child and all events are passed from child to parent till they are handled. If you want to have access to component after rendering you should set ref property for it Now you will be able to get it using this.refs.counter. To gain the access to physical DOM you should call this.refs.counter.getDOMNode().innerHTML. Although it’s not recommended there can be cases when it is necessary. React is powerful framework for Front-end application. And it’s no wonder that huge web-services use it for their goals. It implants another programming approach and restricts access to DOM but in return gives you an instrument for creating fast and easily extended web-applications.

It is especially valuable for commercial projects as in such projects it is extremely important to make an update and deployment in time and to make sure that there was no regression and many other checks. This article start a series of articles on continuous integration, but despite the wholesale throw pillows of the commercial stability described above, the topic of this article is Travis CI, main feature of which is free support of open-source projects. To be honest, if we consider CI as a way of checking the stability of a program and not touch the side of a Continuous Deployment, I use CI for my side open-source projects far more often than for enterprise projects I work on. There are several logical reasons for this: the structure of a library is more conservative and it always suggest a programmer certain API, you expect the way one will use your library and it makes you easier to test your project. The second reason is that you fill responsibility as you know that someone will rely on your implementation and you want it to work perfectly. But the main reason is the existence of such a perfect solution as Travis CI. Travis suggests a cloud-hosted solution, so it’s extremely easy to start using it. Unfortunately it supports only Github integration (users are asking for a BitBucket support for almost 2 years), but still Github is de facto a place for an open-source stuff, so there’s not a lot to worry about. After logging in with Github account you will have possibility to choose the repository you wish to integrate: This will automatically add a service to the repository, which got Travis integration, you may check it on the settings screen of the repository: Now you have everything ready, so Github events will be captured by Travis and it will try to perform some actions on push, though they will be useless until you add the .travis.yml file to the root of your projects. It is YAML file containing build configuration, which is in the simplest case just language of the project and the list of versions of the platform on which you want build to be performed: I personally mostly hack on Node.js projects, among them there are several grunt plugins so the whole testing pipeline is built in terms of Grunt build system. Here is the common configuration: The most important line of configuration here is before_script, which will install grunt-cli as otherwise the build will not be done. One more nice feature suggested by Travis is link to the image indicating build status: Such images are often inserted to the readme of the project so that users, which are going to use the project, can be sure that it is stable. Travis makes the continuous integration painless and the fact that you don’t need to host it on your server should encourage you to use CI for majority of your projects.

All your applications are available through “My Apps” tab. 7. Open the main page of your application You need to retrieve your App ID and name of your application. If you are creating application for iOS you only need to execute this command in your shell: For Android integration you should find a file in your Cordova application that is available by route /platforms/android/res/values/facebookconnect.xml and add these lines: Then execute previous command in your shell. The command installs latest version of Apache Cordova Facebook Plugin from Github using your application ID and name. This plugin uses native Facebook app to perform Single Sign On for a user. This plugin provides some methods for integration with Facebook API. The main methods are: So how can we use these three methods? In your code you can write something like this: The function takes an array of data fields you want to have access to. Also it gets two callback functions - one for successful login, other - to handle an exception. In success function you can do whatever you want i.e. you can get data about user: Now you can easily login via Facebook using facebook-cordova-plugin. If you need more complex logic you can look through their official documentation on Github and use additional methods for that.", "date": "2017-02-09"},

After my graduation from Donetsk Lyceum \"Intellect\" I entered Donetsk National Technical University to study system programming. In my second year I decided to switch to German group. I’ve never studied German before, so that year was quite challenging. When I was in my third year we were supposed to have an internship and the company which organized that for me became my first working place. I came to study there and ended up working in that company as a QA engineer. So, how did you get to Binary Studio? I had been working at that company for almost 4 years when Kate - our HR manager - contacted me. I was not even looking for a job, but I decided to test myself and came to the interview. The result was that I stayed at Binary Studio. How were you found then? Via LinkedIn, where I have my profile - it appeared to be very useful. At my previous workplace I was testing games in game development industry. I should tell you it is quite interesting. For the first couple of years I tested localizations which means that I received the English version of the game and the translated one. I played the game and monitored if the translation was correct. Sounds simple enough, right? Yet, our team worked really hard and translated lots and lots of products. At some point, I went to the publisher site and was very delighted, when 8 out of 10 games on the page had our localizations. After some time I moved to the department that developed social network games and got wider range of responsibilities. Sounds very interesting. So, what do you do in general? What are your main responsibilities? I am quality assurance engineer (QA). You can say, my main objective is information retrieval. There is some specific product or part of it, and I have to provide the information to product owners and other stakeholders about how well it works. Of course, during this process I find bugs which I note and send over to the developers. Let me tell you, if there are no bugs then it is just perfect, but almost impossible =) Also, I look at the product from the user point of view and I find ways how we can make the product better, so I make improval suggestions as well. How exactly do you work with applications - through the interface as a user? Yep, you are correct. I do write automated tests, but still I do that using the GUI. Let me put it that way - I write the tests that would emulate my actions in the application. I mean some QA engineers do code review and provide the suggestions on how to optimize the code, but what I do is different. It is called black-box testing. Do you like working with mostly guys in the company? The work is going great. Starting from the Lyceum I am surrounded by men in my team as well as in the university and at my previous job. So, it is nothing unusual for me. What do you like at Binary Studio? I like that there is always a great motivation for work and self-development. We have a good office, interesting and active people working in it. During my work at Binary Studio I started to read more and to write better and more confident letters to customers. Also, I signed up for testing courses and conferences - in November 2014 I visited QA Fest in Kiev . For QA engineer outsourcing is a kind of challenge. You have to learn how to organize yourself, stay enthusiastic all the time and stay in touch with clients. Of course, it’s true for developers as well. What project are you currently involved in? Canadian project - employees’ motivation tools for HR Department. What do you plan for the future? Have you considered changing what you do? My profession is quite interesting. I mean, children do not dream about becoming “QA”. However, when I started the internship and wrote a test it appeared that I am good at it and I enjoyed it. So, I was not even thinking to become someone else. Of course, there is lots of information to learn in order to be better professional. Currently I am improving my knowledge in two spheres: automation testing and business analysis, so I can be a great all-in-one QA specialist. To be a QA engineer requires lots of attention at work, doesn’t it? Of course, you are absolutely correct. You have to be attentive to details while keeping in mind the general picture and improve your concentration every day. However, it is not only about attention. To start as a QA is not that difficult – you do not need to have any specific skills at the first stage. Later on you discover lots of theoretical information which you need to learn. However, at the beginning, while you learn, you require attention, curiosity, analytical thinking, perseverance and the “gut feeling”. You’ll have to write a lot of documentation as in any research, but the exploration process totally worth it. What about the requirements? Who provides those – customer? At my current project I got lucky with the requirements. There are some projects where the requirements exist only in conversations or are outdated. As for my project, we have a documentation that describes the main features of the product and how it is supposed to work. I do have to clarify lots of things, but the main information is provided. So, communication with customers is also part of your job? That is true. Sometimes QA engineers even analyze the feedback forms from users. So, you have to be very patient to work with users and understand what they meant in each message. However, I do not do that at my current project. In any case as a QA you always search information. There is not much of code writing, but exploration, investigation and communication. Can you share with us the brightest memory of your life? Very memorable for me was the time when I learned to ski. Couple of days I tried to ski slowly, learned how to turn and stop. You won’t believe, but I almost never fell. However, I couldn’t get what was so fun about skiing – why people loved it so much. There was one time when I fell down so hard that I rode the hill on my belly. After that it appeared that there was nothing scary in falling down and skiing became a lot of fun for me (smiling) =) Name 5 things that would characterize your personality at this moment. Half a year ago I could name about 10 things that could characterize me. Now, it's only 5, and they are more activities than the things: reading, coffee & chocolate (can't ignore this bad habit =), walking by the riverside (I treasure it at our current office), continuously improve and discipline myself, learning to enjoy life. In our current situation, when you leave home and are far away from people you care about, keeping a positive approach and enjoy life is the hardest, but I try and succeed! The easiest question of all =) What did you have for lunch today? It was salad. That is it? Just salad? Well, I am planning to eat one more time later on today. I try to have less food at one meal, but eat more often. Diana’s position in company matches her life motto “Happy to help” just right.

Anton you are probably the most mysterious person in the company. Although, you are working at Binary Studio from the first day, we do not know much about you and your interests. However, it was easy to understand your importance in the company when the conference room was stuffed with people who wanted to attend your code-review. There is a couple of questions which I would like to ask you, so we can get to know you better: With the 9th Binary Studio birthday coming up I would like to start from the beginning. Artem and you founded the company during your student years, when you both were on your early twenties. So, how did it happened that such young boys created from scratch a strong IT Company? Artem was the one who came up with the idea and made it possible for the company to exist. I was only working on the computer and clicking the keyboard. Could you, please, tell us in more details how the company started? What was your role when the company was created? Artem found the customer in the Internet and I was the one who wrote the code for him. I am sure Artem and you faced some difficulties during the company growth? What were the challenges you had to overcome? It was quite difficult not to be sarcastic with people I did not know in the team. Currently I try to learn how to avoid this habit, but sometimes I can’t help it. Now I would like to focus on the technical aspects in the company foundation and its further development. I'm sure, there was a stage when you had to become guru of programming. So, how did it happen? I do not think I am guru in any way. The experience in software development accumulates gradually - you just need to take a job you can accomplish, so you do not have to deal with it heroically. Can you tell us about the brightest memory during your work at Binary Studio? I am sure you’ve got lots of those during 9 years.. I remember every single day of my life. Of course, we don’t think that much about offices where we spend years of our life, as about people, who fulfill and bring life to the rooms. Do you mean that people you have worked with all these years left the main trace in your memory? Maybe there's some interesting story associated with your colleagues? Definitely. I would even say that it is not about some \"funny\" stories, but more about human character and relationships between people. Here is one more unsolved mystery about you. Every Wednesday you bring a bunch of candies for all of us (thank you for that). Where did that tradition come from? It is absolutely normal to treat your friends and family at the place where I grew up. It is just a symbolic tradition, which I keep on following - there is nothing special about it. I just want to make the day a little better for my colleagues. I’ve heard a lot about your genius decisions for the Hackathon and the high quality of the code you write. What do you get inspired by? How do you improve your professional skills? I got lucky to work alone at most of my projects, that’s why my colleagues simply can’t see my bugs. It seems that you try to minimize your merits, because after code review guys mentioned that the quality of your code was exceptional. Maybe you have some resources to share with others: services, books, other ones that help you to improve your skills? The main resource is a code which is already written by someone else. You take a look at it and try to understand, why something was done exactly in this way or what this particular construction means. How about we switch from “work” to “leisure” topics? Tells us what else you do besides programming. I’d say that I am a very boring person. My leisure as well as my work is turning around my PC. As one of my teachers characterized me, I am a computer addict. Let me guess: you are gamer =) Some time ago it was like that. Currently I do not play that often. What books and movies inspire you in life? I cannot say that I learned anything special from the mass culture. For me it is more of an entertainment – had some laugh and forgot it right away. Possibly, you find the inspiration in other things? It might be traveling, tasty food or meeting new people. What do you say? I don’t know a person who wouldn’t like to have a delicious meal or travel abroad. We are all people, so nothing human is alien to me. What five things or principles can you highlight in your life as the main ones? I do my best considering my opportunities in life and try to be guided by the rules of formal logic as strange as it may sound. So, the last and the most not serious question: all of us are very interested what you had for lunch yesterday? First meal, second meal and compote. Can you share a secret what that was?) I didn’t pay much of attention. Diana’s position in company matches her life motto “Happy to help” just right.

Here at Binary Studio we are constantly aiming to keep our tech culture on the highest level, therefore our developers often attend various conferences and we also used to host and organise conferences ourselves . Now we’ve started a brand new tech activity - Academy PRO. Academy PRO is a synthesis of two events we’ve been hosting for a long time - Binary Academy and .NET Meetings. The first one occurs once a year when we select a group of talented students and teach them how to cook the technologies right. As for .NET Meetings, they used to happen each Thursday, when .NET department gathered in a conference room and discussed some technology or technique for about an hour. However, with time it lost its regularity, and as the result it hardly gathered half the department. Another important drawback was that the material reporter shared with the audience was easily forgotten, it was treated by their colleagues as a possibility to have an hour of a rest, than a possibility to study. So together these two ideas made up Academy PRO. It includes a set of scheduled lectures just like regular Academy, but the listeners are skilled programmers, not students. This detail makes it a more sophisticated task for the lecturer to prepare the material as he should estimate the initial knowledge of buy throw pillows and on the one hand he must cover topic completely from the beginning, but on the other hand, course should contain lots of non-trivial information which cannot be found with quick research. Apart from that, there is also hometask assigned after almost every lecture, this is an obligatory requirement to the course as practice turns lecture listeners into developers with experience of working with current technology. Normally Academy PRO course consists of 4-10 lectures covering certain topic completely. Most of the times the complexity increases from lecture to lecture. Hometask for lectures is to enhance the one prepared for the previous lesson utilizing the knowledge achieved this time. Lessons are taking place once or twice a week, which depends on the number of lectures planned. We stick to the estimation of one month for a course. Regarding the lecturers, any developer may play this role. Everyone can share some knowledge he\\she has and it will be quite unique within company. Though the benefits from such courses are apparent, what we value the most is that this is a community-driven self-development activity, which enables you to learn something new and to share your expertise in a relaxed atmosphere. On top of that,  Academy PRO helps both: those who deliver lectures and those, who listens to them: course audience gets technology knowledge, lecturer strengthens his own skills even more and besides he gets experience of public speaking, which may be handy for him personally and also gives him confidence for speaking on possible public conferences in future. We have already tried Academy PRO in action with several courses ( JS course, ANTLR ) and it showed itself perfect. So far courses are taking place once a month and we are not going to slow down - we have scheduled a few courses to the next several months (Mongo DB, Architecture design, Agile engineering, etc). They understand essay writing involves your point of view on a particular topic or subject and that your paper needs to be written in a clear and organized manner for it to be successful. They are also familiar and knowledgeable in regard to the essential components which need to be included in essay writing . If you want your essay to be a reflection of all your hard work it will need to include factual and accurate research that is presented with the use of description and analysis.

Android 4.3 introduces a built-in support for Bluetooth Low Energy, providing corresponding API. In this series of articles you will learn how to communicate with BLE devices, using Xamarin Monodroid platform. First article makes a quick overview of the BLE protocol and describes how to discover BLE devices and establish connection with them and what problems might occur. Introduction BLE is used for communication between devices. Each device, during communication, can have one of two major roles: It is similar to traditional client-server architecture, where peripheral has data, needed by other devices, and central makes requests for this data. Device that plays central role scans for peripheral devices, establishes connection, and interacts with peripheral services to obtain required data. Device playing peripheral role make itself visible for central by advertising. Peripheral advertises packets of data, containing information that may be useful for central. This is how central finds peripheral. After peripheral establishes connection, central device provides a set of services , used by peripheral to obtain data. What is service in terms of BLE? Service is an aggregate of characteristics , representing values. From the central point of view it is an address of data. Peripheral device can provide more than one service. For instance BLE enabled teapot may have temperature-service (providing temperature value), control-service (for control purposes), battery-service (providing current battery level) and so on. As previously said, service contains a set of characteristics. Characteristic contains a value and 0-n descriptors . For example, temperature-service may have the characteristics, representing current water temperature, maximum water temperature and so on. Characteristics may be one of three types: This is basically all we need to know to exchange the data via BLE protocol. Let's take a look at the details of central role implementation. Central role (Gatt Client) To use BLE in Android you should add the following permissions to AndroidManifest file: Bluetooth communication in Android starts from BluetoothAdapter object. You can obtain it via BluetoothManager : BluetoothAdapter lets you manipulate Bluetooth power state via Enable / Disable methods: However, be careful - enabling or disabling Bluetooth from the code may lead to Bluetooth error, which can be fixed only by rebooting your device. To avoid this make sure that other Bluetooth operations are not executing at the moment of enabling/disabling, and don't start executing right after enabling, before Bluetooth is fully initialized. Android Bluetooth API doesn't like concurrent operations and should be used in sequential manner. Finding Devices Now that we have BluetoothAdapter instance, we can start scanning for the nearby devices. For starting or stopping device discovery two methods are used - StartLeScan () and StopLeScan (). Both methods accept as argument an object, implementing OnLeScan() callback, called each time Bluetooth device is discovered. In callback we receive StartLeScan() method also accepts  array of service UUIDs, used for filtering out the devices that do not support this services. Unfortunately it might not be working. If you have such problem a work around would be to parse the advertiseData contained in scanRecord . This would allow you to obtain an identifying service UUID of a found peripheral. You can use it then for a filtering purpose. Here you can read more about it. Connecting to peripheral Now that we have discovered the peripheral device we are interested in, the next step would be to establish connection. To establish a connection we use ConnectGatt() method of the discovered BluetoothDevice instance. ConnectGatt() method returns BluetoothGatt instance, which will be used for further interactions with connected BLE device. Except context, ConnectGatt() accepts two arguments: boolean autoConnect and BluetoothGattCallback gattCallback. AutoConnect argument is useful if the BLE device is in range at the time of connection attempt. If you want to automatically connect as soon as it becomes available you should set autoConnect to true. Otherwise connection attempt would be made only once. However, from my experience, when autoConnect is set to true, connection might take 30+ seconds. I was able to reduce this delay by starting scanning process for a short period of time, right after connection attempt. GattCallback is used for observation of Bluetooth events. BluetoothGattCalback provides a set of methods to override, called each time BLE events occur, like connection state change, write/read/notify operations result and so on. Here is the example of the GattCallback object: Right now we are interested in OnConnectionStateChanged callback, because this is where we track all changes of connection state. Here we are presented with two new arguments GattStatus and ProfileState . GattStatus indicates the result of connect/disconnect operation. ProfileState shows current connection state. In the example below we output all connection state changes. If you want to check current connection state of the specific device you can do this by getting list of the connected devices and checking if the device is there. This is where previously obtained BluetoothManager instance comes in handy. Disconnection When we are finished working with the remote device, we can disconnect it directly using BluetoothGatt object. It is also preferable to close the BluetoothGatt afterwards. Device will be also disconnected if it is out of range or Bluetooth is disabled. You can call bluetoothDevice.ConnectGatt() after disconnection with autoConnect set to true, in order to connect right after device becomes available. However this would not work if you do this after Bluetooth was disabled. In this case you should listen to Bluetooth state and try to connect when Bluetooth is enabled again. Conclusion In this article you obtained some theoretical knowledge about BLE protocol and learned how to discover and establish connection with BLE devices on Android.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "detecting-unused-functions", "author": ["Sergey Dmitrouk"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2014/09/02/detecting-unused-functions/", "abstract": "Introduction This article provides description of a tool that scans a set of source files looking for two types of functions declared with external linkage: 1. Those that are defined, but completely unused. 2. Those that are used only inside same translation unit they are defined in. As a result we want to get: 1. Diagnostics that functions of the first type are unused, which means that one of the following holds: 2. Diagnostics that functions of the second type can be marked as static (in case the code is not part of a library; going to ignore this as it can be added later), as they are probably: Not all static analyzers provide such diagnostics and those that do - they do not advise to mark functions that are used only inside one translation unit with static rather than external linkage. As existing tools don't do exactly this, the \"programmers way\" of fixing this is to write our own tool (actually, much better option is too implement this diagnostic in cppcheck and send patch upstream, but we're mostly interested in learning more about AST of Clang and want to use it to solve the task; still nothing stops one from contributing to cppcheck). For simplicity, we're going to do this for C rather that C++ to omit dealing with namespaces and methods. This allows us to concentrate on new stuff about Clang representation of source, leaving extending the tool to cover more use cases out of the scope. This article also contains less sources - only the most interesting excerpts from the code are presented. Matching To do something useful we need to find elements of AST that we're interested in on the first place. This time they are: 1. Function declarations. 2. Function calls. 3. Getting address of a function. Matchers used for the first item are very simple and the names are easy to find in documentation/headers with AST matchers/or even just to guess it: The last two items we want to be able to find require additional investigation. Lets make it simple by asking clang to dump AST of the following simple code to the screen (file named “func-ptr.c”): Using this command: Here is full output: Look at this part: which corresponds to obtaining address of the function: void (*f)(void) = &func; Lets construct AST matcher for it: Looks like a nice matcher, but we're not going to use it. The reason is that the address of a function can be taken by implicit cast if one removes & in front of function name. That's why it makes sense to use a simpler and more general matcher, which is just an inner part of the one listed above: This effectively matches the leaf node: As it's similar to the leaf node of a call expression, we're getting all referencing cases we want with only one matcher. Note that funcDecl is of type DeclarationMatcher rather then usual StatementMatcher. This is because each of core components of AST have its own hierarchies with different root objects, which means that such elements must be matched using different types of matchers. Filtering Someone might ask: how would we get function definition if we're only looking for declarations of functions? It's easy to understand if recall that every definition is also a declaration. So there is no such thing as function definition in Clang's AST, there aredeclarations with bodies instead. To check for body, use isThisDeclarationADefinition() method. There are also methods that check whether given function has body at all, don't confuse them with the method we actually need. On each match of a function declaration we want to make sure that function is visible outside current module as we're not interested in static functions. This can be done with the help of isExternallyVisible() method. If you think of checking general programs, the first external function that comes to mind is probably the main() function. We don't want to mark it as unused, so filter it out by invoking handy isMain() method. Match of funcRef matcher gives us result of type DeclRefExpr which we need to resolve to function declaration it's referring to. This is done by the following code: Here getDecl() returns ValueDecl which corresponds to a variable, function or enumeration constant definition. Then we query obtained ValueDecl object whether it can be converted to a function and get it as a function if the answer is yes. The check of return value is needed even if \"it's definitely a function\" because a node can return 0 in case of parsing errors (say, the code is correct, but some headers are missing). Counting Counting functions and references to them is more tricky than finding ones for the following reasons: Functions can be declared in any number of modules or can be declared multiple times in one translation unit. Function can be referred to before it's defined. Third-party and system functions are matched as well. As we want to get same results while scanning one file at a time in any order, bullets listed above should be treated carefully. The implementation addresses items listed above in the following way: Functions are stored in a map indexed by their names. There will be no name conflicts as we match only external functions and there are no overloaded functions in C. Each function information object stores list of references. Each function declaration and reference is associated with name of a file it resides in used to check whether function is ever referenced outside translation unit it is defined in. Printing To print exact position of something SourceLocation class lacks connection with actual source code. That's why FullSourceLoc needs to be constructed from an instance of SourceLocation and a reference to SourceManager . Here's how retrieval of source file name and line number can look like: Note getNameInfo().getBeginLoc() part. Getting location by calling getLocation() directly on an object of type FunctionDecl will return location of return type of the function. To be more programmer-friendly we want to guide one directly to function name, which is more convenient in my opinion. If it's still unclear why, here are two samples: Blocking diagnostics output One somewhat annoying in our use case thing about Clang is that by default it prints diagnostics on code being analyzed. We want to suppress such diagnostic messages to leave only our own. The correct way of doing this is to call DiagnosticsEngine::setSuppressAllDiagnostics , but it's not clear how to get instance of DiagnosticsEngine used by tool while it builds ASTs. So we go another way and subclass DiagnosticConsumer to override its IncludeInDiagnosticCounts method and make it return false: This way such diagnostics are not counted as relevant when Clang tries to present parsing results to a user. This way such diagnostics are not counted as relevant when Clang tries to present parsing results to a user. Testing Assuming that you have successfully built the tool from the repository lets give  it a run over a simple test files. The first file (main.c) looks like this: Lets check output when the first file is analyzed alone (paths are truncated): Let's go over the file manually to check whether obtained output is correct: main() is treated separately. firstStatic() and secondStatic() are both ignored because they are marked as static. firstExtern() declared as not static and isn't used. secondExtern() declared as extern and used only within the same translation unit. Looks good. Now add the second file (util.c): And see what's changed in the output (paths are truncated): Expected changes are as follows: Both and are not used outside their home module, so no diagnostics should mention them. New unused function () was introduced. Looks correct too. By the way, here's the output for func-ptr.c test file from the \"Matching\" section above: Conclusion As you've been warned, this is more C-related implementation than C++, but such limitation allowed for concise description and ready-to-use state after putting not that much effort in the implementation. The resultant tool can be adjusted in multiple ways by changing matching/counting/output parts independently: Note that as Clang takes macros into account the tool can produce not accurate results if conditional compilation is used. Precisely, it analyzes some particular combination, defines and ignores all other. That's why it's better to check updated code against combinations of macro defines or at least remember about them. This is important for cross-platform applications or programs that allow to disable some of their features at compile-time. Resources", "date": "2017-02-08"},

As you may know before the trip in Binary Studio blog we described our expectations about  this event , so now we surely can say that the festival has met all of them. The first thing which surprised us was the number of participants.We were over 500 and all tickets had been booked long time before the event. Today, after  QA Fest, we can easily characterize Ukrainian QA community as an active, progressive, fast-growing and constantly developing one, both within the companies and in the whole country.We assume that due to such events our QA community keeps evolving. Ok. Lets start from the beginning) The long awaited conference met us with welcoming organizers who helped us check in and gave delicious QA-cupcakes. He had enough time for making new acquaintances, have a cup of coffee and get to know the format of QA fest. Then the time for reports finally came. All of them seemed to be so interesting, that every hour we had to make a tough decision: which of three reports running simultaneously would be the most useful for our work. And now for everyone who is interested in testing we will briefly describe what we've learnt, and hope that it will motivate you to learn and use new technologies and approaches for testing your projects. Vyacheslav Pankratov , the most exciting speaker, opened the festival. He reminded us, that the development process is tightly connected to communication, and it's very important to find the proper approach to everyone in your  team. He told us about two personality typologies, they are:DISC typing system and personality types by Adizes. He recommended to define a personality type of each teammate and use personal approach to achieve your own goals quickly and without conflicts. Vyacheslav’s report was a great start of festival, and all participants were divided into three groups according  3 existed sections: Classic zone, Tech zone and Stand-up zone. Classic zone: Sergiy Tsymbal 's Defect prevention gathered lots of participants. As the title implies, he reviewed the techniques of defect prevention. He noted, that it's important to start looking for defects first of all at the requirements stage and then in code, involving senior engineers in QA activities. He recommended the following methods for the cause analysis: risk management, root cause analysis, 5 whys, fishbone diagram, defect taxonomies, retrospectives. Obviously, after the cause identification the counter-measures must be taken. He suggested to change the test approach, to add new test cases, to change the process and also perform configuration management audit. QA coach Alexei Lupan recommended to write test cases only if it's impossible to describe the bug reproduction case using one sentence without the possibility of misinterpretation. In his report he considered grouping prioritized test ideas into checklists as more effective approach. Also, Alexei emphasized the difference between function testing and functionality testing and recommended to devote more time to the last one. Speaker Igor Bondarenko shared his experience of large-scale project testing, which has been developed for over 7 years. Paradigmatic Agile approach appeared to be inefficient within the context, therefore it was decided to implement some changes into process, which, to Igor’s opinion, brought the project to a new level. First of all, 2-week sprint included tasks for 9 workdays, leaving the last day for estimation errors, urgent tasks outside of the sprint scope and internal backlog tasks. Also, poker planning was replaced by time estimations. Moreover, estimation by each team member was adjusted by a certain ratio, according to a person's experience in related tasks. The team also abandoned the daily scrum, and it had beneficial effect on the project development. All project details were tracked in Jira task comments. Yuriy Suvorov told us how to use Pivot tables in conjunction with TFS to simplify metric gathering in integrated projects. He organized a small workshop on TFS/XLS connection establishment and showed us how to create pivot tables and report charts based on the received data. They looked cute) In the review lecture « Web-magic of QA processes » , Anton Kapitanenko shared his experience of building a QA process from pre-production to support phase in a project with a large number of users. During a short report he managed to cover all aspects of the QA process: pre-production activities, QA in a development phase, types of non-functional testing, Dev / Test environments, test artifacts, product release and post-release activities. Tech zone: Alexandra Volkova told us about the main advantages of system integration using Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). And why ESB testing must be started from designing mocks. Also, she listed basic test scenarios of synchronous and asynchronous ESB testing. She suggested SoapUI as a tool for interaction with the Web services and mock development. Alexey Zvolinskiy spoke about Responsive Design QA automation . He represented Galen Framework as a tool to solve the problem of automated testing of such applications. This tool was developed by Ukrainian programmer Ivan Shubin from Odessa and it's very popular in Web application UI testing area. \"Do not reinvent the wheel\", warned us Mikalai Alimenkou . He encouraged us to use existing solutions for testing automation and introduced Thucydides framework as a bright representative of one of them. Also, he reminded us about the importance of choosing the appropriate automation approach, test structure and test reports. Thucydides is a great solution for creating acceptance tests using Selenium WebDriver + Java and supports advanced integration with JIRA. Anna Gavriluk in her \" Cool as Сucumber \" shared practical tips of using BDD and Gherkin for creating tests in Cucumber. She also told us about some pitfalls that we encounter in BDD implementation, and about importance of using natural English while writing Specifications by Example in Gherkin. Stand-up zone: Akim Boyko gave us an introductory lecture about Model thinking . He explained, how the usage of models makes easier to solve the tasks of exploration and expected result definition, and how important it is to choose the correct model. His report reminded us of using models as test oracles by Cem Kaner and inspired us to research model based testing materials. Viktor Gozhij shared his experience of performing usability testing in his report “ Practice of usability testing from A to Z ” . He stated, that there's no need to follow the written laws of usability testing strictly, and told us how he managed to minimize the costs of this kind of testing in his project. The report didn't go without a makeshift workshop. Kateryna Ovechenko 's report \"Sessions safety in Web applications: practical usage\" was a big surprise, which closed the conference. She presented a structured types of session vulnerabilities in Web applications and showed us some examples of these exploits. Also, she spoke about the preventive measures against such attacks. Finally, after numerous requests, we will tell you about \"Testers classification fron the programmer’s point of view \" by Mikalai Alimenkou. He introduced 13 negative types of testers. The report made each member of the audience see themselves as others see them  and work on their weaknesses. To cut a long story short, what new, from what we've learned, can we use in our everyday work? Of course it is all of the methods, that Sergiy Tsymbal mentioned in his Defect prevention report, which could be applicable to any project by all of the team members including QA. Represented Thucydides, Allure, Cucumber and Galen technologies are implementable in Web application testing. Also, we should run scenarios, described in Alexandra Volkova's report, in projects with complex architecture, which includes Web services. To sum up, we can say, that this long-awaited event met our expectations. Some of the topics forced up to take another look at the current solutions problem and apply new approaches, that were mentioned above, on practice. Look forward to the next article in QA Fest rubric in a year! PS:  We cannot help mentioning a cool festival afterparty) From Binary Studio QA, with love", "date": "2017-02-08"},

No, no, I do not want to talk about how beautiful Paris Opera is with its huge hall, red velour fabric, and a magnificent, beautiful stage. It is the location which was unusual: it is situated on a side street in the usual narrow alley. It’s like you are just walking around the streets in Paris and then bam – you’ve decided to go to the opera. Probably that’s what a typical Parisian does on typical day. The first thing we saw reaching the Opera was a huge queue, on both sides of the street. As I said above, because street is narrow, these people almost blocked the road for cars. If didn’t know that all those people were developers, I would think that Parisians like Opera so much, and wait in the queues on Monday morning. Passing by, my colleague Nikita calmly said - \"Look, Addy Osmani is standing in line.\" WHAT?? Senior Developer Programs Engineer at Google is just standing in line? Even though we were in Paris at the largest JavaScript conference in Europe, it was still surprising. After a while, being already a few steps away from the door, we understood why there were two lines, not one. In fact they are divided alphabetically according to the names – A-K left queue, L-Z – right one. It was handwritten on a white paper hanging on the front door. Well, thank you! I'm at a conference where developers find out information from the paper. Anyway, we had to change the line and wait for our turn again. Inside, there was simple registration procedure, where I got a participant badge (it was even checked once), T-shirt and stickers, it was real developers’ heaven! It seemed all the cool companies in the world have gathered here, telling you about their latest developments, and showing colorful banners, sharing tips and free subscription. JetBrains, Zengularity, AuthO, Google Devs, WordPress - guys, you are just awesome. Thank you for sponsoring the conference. And now, closer to the point - the conference. There were many speakers, each talked about different things, but at some point it occured to me that most of the speakers came to this event with the slogan - \"Hey, I wrote a cool npm module and today I'll be working on its PR.\" Letting alone that I was strongly against it, or that it ruined my impression – it was just strange. However, there were guys who really surprised, inspired, and I just liked them. One of them, for example, the first speaker - James Halliday aka Substack. At first glance, he seemed to me very strange and shocking - he waved his arms, jumped and revealed mixed feelings. It seemed that he was rather playing in the theater than standing on stage with a serious technical report. Have you noticed that he looks like Steve Jobs in his youth? Michael Stern should have taken him as a main character for his film. Thanks God James is not a Hollywood actor but a very cool developer and he did prove it in the next 15 minutes. His report was about offline client applications that continue working even if the server is shut down. Thus, some queries can be cached, and that’s allows to reduce the load on the server and make certain parts (and perhaps the entire application) offline. He so skillfully mastered the keyboard that, at times, his words simply  were not catching up to his actions. The second man, whom I have mentioned - Angus Croll. To be honest – I wasn’t impressed by him at first, but I felt that he would tell something interesting. I was right. Despite the fact that his report belonged to JS only indirectly, those were really cool 15 minutes. He cited some funny stories from his book, quotes and messages. His sense of humor is awesome. The audience applauded him standing at the end of the performance, it was totally worth it. Well, the third top speaker, in my opinion, is - Joe McCann - CEO in NodeSource. Here is when I felt all the charm of a technical conference. Joe described some hidden features of NodeJS platform , which I did not know before. He showed in practice the flags that you can use when running a NodeJS web server, as well as how they can be used to improve the performance of NodeJS applications. From him I learned how to interact with the C ++ code of JS among NodeJS, and change these flags \"on the fly\" at runtime. In between sessions, I not only talked to the cool guys enjoing French cookies ( they were just what I expected ), but learned about new cloud services, protocols, editors, frameworks. In addition, I talked in person to the guys from Google, JetBrains, Mozilla. There were a lot of cool speakers, which I, unfortunately, did not mention, but still they gave me a lot of bright and positive emotions. For example, at the beginning of the conference a girl came up and asked to sit down next to us– nothing special. When presenter on the stage said: \"Soledad Penadés, Senior engineer at Mozilla is invited to the stage\". She silently got up and went up to the stage. We could not understand what had just happened. However, that is another story ... 🙂 DotJS made a huge impression on me. I was surprised by the level of preparation and organization. I liked that the coolest JS developers from all over the world - are just normal people who are happy to communicate, share new ideas, give advices. Thanks once again to the organizers of the conference, and thanks to Binary Studio, which gave me an opportunity to dive into the world of JS.

This task usually takes a lot of time and is usually laborious, so tools, with formal description of data conversion as input parameters and return syntax tree with which you can continue your work, are very useful and sometimes are even real rescue. Today I'd like to tell you about one of this magic parser box called ANTLR. ANTLR or ANother Tool for Language Recognition was created by a professor of computer science with great sence of humor at the University of San Francisco Terence Parr , who has been working on language tools since 1989. I’ve got acquainted with ANTLR in Binary Studio Academy Pro . The main idea of that course was to give basic knowledges about ANTLR and its main features. There were 4 interesting lectures with lots of practice examples. On the first lecture lector explained what ANTLR can and where it is used. Also he explained what lexer and parser are used for in ANTLR. After all of that we’ve built simple grammar and tried to parse strings in Visual Studio. But then he asked to make a simple parser for calculator as the hometask to see how much simpler it can be made by using ANTLR in future. On the second lecture we were speaking a lot about grammar rules, Extended Backus-Naur Form. At the end of lecture we’ve built JSON parser. Next hometask was much better because making parser for calculator with ANTLR is much simpler than make it by hands. Third lecture was the hardest. Sasha was talking a lot about Parser Structure and about ANTLR Error Handling. But this lecture proved that ANTLR is really cool thing, especially its ability to recover after failures. The last lecture was about ANTLR cool abilities, for example recursive rules, semantic predicates, actions and lots of other. So, what is ANTLR? As Parr said himself, it is “a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing or translating structured text or binary files”. It works as follows: first you write formal description or grammar, then ANTLR generates recognizer classes for target programming language (for example C#, Java, etc), then you give data to them and ANTLR return syntax tree, which was build by your description. You can see this process on figure 1. Figure 1 – ANTLR data recognition ANTLR is specified using a context-free grammar which is expressed using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). EBNF – is set of rules, which determine relations between terminal and nonterminal symbols. Terminal symbols are minimal set of symbols which don't have own grammatical structure, for example some digits or words. Nonterminal symbols are grammatical elements, which have own structure and names, for example math operation. Let's take a look on recognition process in more details on simple example. For this purpose, we will build a simple calculator and find answer to children riddle 2+2*2. First of all we should build following grammar: As you can see main rule is statement, that can be expression (2+2*2), can declare identifier (a=2) or use them (a+b). Expression consists of two operands 'a' and 'b' and arithmetic operation with them. Note, that MUL and DIV are declared before ADD and SUB. It was made to realized priority mechanism which works in ANTLR by declaring order. Syntax diagram of this rule is shown on figure 2. Figure 2 – Syntax diagram of expr rule When ANTLR gets string, it will divide it for tokens. In this example there are will be 5 tokens: three tokens '2' with type INT and two tokens with operation types ADD and MUL. It calls lexical analysis and it was made by lexer. In grammar lexical rules start with uppercase. Then all tokens go to syntax analysis, which is made by parser. Parser rule starts with lower case. Input linear sequence of tokens compares with written grammar and on output we got syntax tree as on figure 3. Figure 3 – Syntax tree of expression “2+2*2” As you can see, if we use data from this tree in calculator we will get 6 as the answer instead of 8 and we'll be right. It was very simple example of using ANTLR. It has a lot of buns, for example it has powerful mechanism for recovering after fails, it copes good with left recursion, gave ability to create own error handlers and makes parsing really good. So, if you want to create your own language or write a program with user-friendly dialogs between user and your app you should pay attention on ANTLR. Work with grammars is much simpler when you use gui editor in which you can debug your rules. ANTLR has its gui editor, but it doesn’t work ideally, so one of students has written plugin. It highlights grammar syntax and visualize syntax tree, which is very useful for debugging grammatics.  You can find plugin with installation instructions by following github link .", "date": "2017-02-08"},

Thus during websites' and services' development one should pay attention to specifics of this gadgets. It is well known fact that they are the most vulnerable place is battery life. technologies move forward at incredible pace, screens get more pixels, processors from their side - new cores but accumulator lasts for 1 day of active usage tops. As a rule developers generally ignore this factors. But why? The reason is simple - often they don't have API for real time check of battery state. Battery status API provides this kind of information. It allows to control current charge and raises events when this state changes. This standard was suggested in 2012, and wasn't changed much since that time. For now it is W3C standard recommendation. What does it actually mean? It says that guys who developed this specification wait for feedback from developers community. Owing to Battery Status API, developer would have the possibly temporary pause the execution of complex source-consuming operations, lessen requests to the server, switch off some modules and so on. Battery status API could also be used for saving user's data right before device switches off due to empty battery. Many will be grateful for such a functionality. It happens quite often when you lose your changes because your gadget goes off without giving any notices. Battery Status API provides four read-only properties, in window.navigator.battery object: It is worth remembering that in chargingTime is stored time until complete recharge of the battery and not the discharge. In addition, there are four events that are raised by window.navigator.battery on every change of previously described properties: let's take a look at the example: All this features give developer full control over application execution with possible adjustments based upon gadget's specifics. And what about support everything looks not so good. Despite the fact that standard was applied by W3C community in 2012, currently only Firefox supports it without vendor prefix. It’s strange cause Battery status API of such type would allow solving problems with energy consumption in web-applications. There is also no analogue for Battery API in any JS library, it is caused by browser's restriction policy on hardware access. That’s why you should always check whether battery API is available at all before trying to make use of it And at the end I would like to provide example of Battery API usage in some simplest application, in which clients from time to time requests some information from the server. Timeout between requests depends on battery charge.

The name \"C sharp\" was inspired by musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch. Last year Microsoft presented new features in C# 6.0. Their goal was to simplify coding and they succeeded. Everyone knows null-conditional operator and auto-property initializer. Microsoft also improved new compiler performance. Today in 2015, The community tries again to improve the language and simplify the process of code writing. Now it is focused on cloud/data and performance/reliability. The list of features of C# 7.0 is being prepared and here one can have a look at them https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/2136 Once again community tries to extract benefits from existing paradigms and implement them within C#. In this article I’d like to show you how the language has developed in the dynamic direction and how to hide strongly typed language under wraps of syntactic sugar and features of C#. Ancient typed language All you need is delegates. C# 2.0 gives us many improvements. At that time language didn’t have such dynamics but reduction of code sizes was highly desirable, And here anonymous delegates came to the rescue. Delegates allowed to pass one function into another using the analog of the pointer. Good example is a calling function in a separate thread: In C# 3.0 the feature of a functional language was implemented – lambda-expression. It simplified code significantly, The previously written snipped now looks far better : Most of all lambdas are used in method-based LINQ queries as arguments to standard query operator methods such as Where . They allow the Where calls to look similar nevertheless the type of object created from the lambda is different. Reflection for the rescue Want to see the devil, look at your reflection. Next step in the development of dynamics in C# 3.0 was made towards reflection which has already showed itself successfully in Java. Reflection in C# gave great opportunities for obtaining information about the code in runtime. In addition, it was possible to dynamically load individual assemblies for execution. And most importantly it becomes possible to write new assembly in runtime. The common steps to create your own dynamically created Assembly Also, it was possible to create anonymous types. Anonymous types make it easy to encapsulate the read-only properties into a single object without having to determine the type first. Type name is created by the compiler and is not available on the source code level. The type of each property is established by the compiler. At the same time Microsoft started to add even more anonymity to C# - next step was implicit type which could be set to local variables. Keyword var allows the compiler know that it can determine type of variable from the expression located on the right side of operator initialization. Output type can be built-in, anonymous, user type or the type specified in the class library of the .NET Framework. or DLR We need more supported language. DLR architecture https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233052%28v=vs.110%29.aspx С# 4.0 was marked by the release of DLR – Dynamic Language Runtime. It meant that we could use scripting language in .NET such as IronRuby and IronPython. Moreover it provided the source of DLR with which it became possible to create your own dynamic language for .NET, if you needed it. DLR includes Expression Trees which are representation of method calls or binary operations in the form of a tree. Their functionality can be viewed at the following example: Another great feature of DLR is Call Site caching. It is a dynamic view of method calls or operations of dynamic objects. DLR caches the characteristics of objects and operations and if the operation had been performed earlier than DLR received  all necessary information from the cache. Finally, there is a set of classes and interfaces: IDynamicMetaObjectProvider, DynamicMetaObject, DynamicObject and ExpandoObject implemented in DLR. DLR also gives new opportunities for COM Interop. Now COM objects can be declared as dynamic and there is no reason to bring them to certain types of calls to methods or properties. // instead Caller information Who's Your Daddy. Much emphasis has been placed on the new async capabilities in C# 5.0. However there are smaller -- but still useful -- features of which you may not be aware. There are a few other neat little things Microsoft has added to C# that will help make your code cleaner and easier to maintain. In C# 5.0 you can get  information about the caller to a method. You can get file path of the source code, the line number in the source code and the member name of the caller. This information is helpful for tracing, debugging and creating diagnostic tools. Caller Info values are emitted as literals into the Intermediate Language (IL) at compile time. // And In this version we also faced some breaking changes. The first involved foreach loops and lambda expressions. In previous versions of the C# compiler any lambda expression that used the iteration variable within the expression (a \"nested lambda expression\") captured the last value of the iteration variable, not each value through the loop. Now lambda captures the value instead of reference. The second breaking change is similar to the first one but involves LINQ expressions. Syntactic sugar The best example of useful sugar is  semicolon. C# 6.0 gives us a lot of syntactic sugar to reduce the amount of code. Some of them look like features of scripting language: Future Everything new is well forgotten old. C # continues to evolve and the seventh version can bring a lot of useful and interesting changes. There is a suggestion to add tuples types: // Or As we can see the code in C # becomes more similar to script and less tied to the types of data. At the same time it affects the performance of the application. So now the development of language is directed towards performance and cloud computing. For these purposes the difference between strongly typed and  scripting language should be substantially reduced. And I hope that soon we will be able to use both these languages together (with the same high performance).", "date": "2017-02-08"},

This aspect is incredibly important while user after seeing popup message with Critical error and a bunch of strange symbols will close this application and will avoid to open it ever again. And not less attention should be paid to architectural decision that will allow to use global error handler instead of using copied code overall. By default in MVC applications (v.2+) you have possibility to switch on standard error handler. To do this you should simply add next line to config's section : Let's add action to home controller to check this: When you call this action you will get something like this: After that user gets heart attack and switches to mode “it wasn’t me”. Now we switch flag to “on” and try once more. This time our exception was handled and user got some clear (or almost clear) error-message. How does it work? Secret is in default configuration of MVC-application. On start application calls method RegisterGlobalFilters() which performs following action: This is the one that handles exceptions in MVC applications' actions. By default all errors are rendered to “Error” view (that can be found in ~/Views/Shared). Behavior of HandleErrorAttribute can be configured through following attributes: MVC framework also adds information about exceptions occurred in ViewDataDictionary instance, where Model will contain exemplar of ExceptionContext. The following information is stored In dictionary ViewData: Method described before is very easy to implement, but HandleErrorAttribute catches only unhandled controllers' exception. If exception was raised in some other place then user will get that scary error message shown before or error page, set up in customErrors in Web.config. Standard mechanism works fine for restricted class of tasks, but sometimes full control for exception handling is needed. ASP.NET provides few levels for error handling in the application. There are 3 methods to do this: Page_Error, Application_Error and configuration file (Web.config mentioned before). Let’s use method Application_Error in Global.asax and redirect application to expected actions. First of all we create ErrorController, that will perform redirection, and few actions inside. Below you can see complete implementation: Now we will write extension method for Exception class that will try to get ErrorCode and redirect call accordingly to ErrorController So, in this method we’ll try to cast exception to HttpException after that we’ll read error code and define action for redirection. And for catching excptions we’ll use Application_Error. Don’t forget to set flag in web.config to default value. <customErrorsmode=\"Off\"> That’s all.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "3-detecting-wrong-includes-c", "author": ["Sergey Dmitrouk"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2015/06/04/3-detecting-wrong-includes-c/", "abstract": "Introduction There is a well known (or at least I hope that it's well known) good practice to include header that corresponds to the current source file before including any other headers. It's recommended by multiple C++ coding style guides (for example by Google C++ Style Guide ) and indeed makes sense to follow. To put it short: it makes finding incomplete headers really easy. If you forget to include required header, corresponding source file just won't compile. This way there will be no hidden (implicit) dependencies among modules of a project as well as dependencies on system headers. Below is a simple example that demonstrates such situation. Let's look at three files: Although both cpp-files should compile without errors, it's easy to see that util.hppfile lacks include of system header. There is no errors because both cpp-files include before including util.hpp, which hides the fact that util.hppis not standalone as it depends on source files it's included in. Simple swapping two includes in util.cpp file like this: Makes the issue pop up almost immediately, precisely when util.cpp file is compiled. As std::string is unknown at point of inclusion of util.hpp, compiler will issue errors on its usages in util.hpp. This discussion is meant to outline usefulness of the approach when \"self include\" is placed at the top of the file above all other includes. Hope everyone are convinced now. Even though this usage of the approach clearly provides some benefits, not everyone use it and some don't even know about it. Here is where a need for tool that checks whether programmer followed described approach or not arises. Such a tool could also check that corresponding header file is included at all. Since implementing this check doesn't add much interesting details to the code and requires some heuristics to check whether the header exists in the first place, it's left out of this memo. Nevertheless, implementing it later requires only additions to the code. New type of FrontendAction Comparing to previous articles, here we don't need AST at all. Parsing performed by preprocessor at lexical analysis stage of source file processing is enough to extract include directives . That is the reason why we need to get more familiar with FrontendAction . There are plenty of them and it's important to pick one that fits better. So far we've indirectly met with the ASTFrontendAction at the very end of our main() functions. Here is the code: finder.getMatchFinder() returns MatchFinder & . So where is the FrontendAction? In this case it's implicitly created by one of several overloads of newFrontendActionFactory() function. If you look at MatchFinder closer, you'll see that it doesn't inherit from any class. It works thanks to duck typing , overloaded used in this case assumes that its argument implements method with the following signature (or the similar one that can be used without compilation errors): Then value returned by this function is wrapped within a local class derived from ASTFrontendAction. To implement our current task another overload of newFrontendActionFactory() function is needed. In this case it takes type of FrontendAction derived class as its only template parameter and instantiates it when required. If you can't understand/recollect why do we need to use any factory at all, here is fast answer: each file is processed by new instance of FrontendAction, hence the need for a factory of such objects. Now that we know how to create new FrontendActions, let's pick concrete type of action we want to use. There are already several actions related to preprocessor stage, which can be viewed at documentation page for PreprocessorFrontendAction . It shouldn't be hard to guess that we'd like to use PreprocessOnlyAction class, it successfully prevents creation of AST which should make processing of really huge sources fast and smooth for our tool. For curious ones, here is how PreprocessOnlyAction prevents AST generation in code: Here is documentation on usesPreprocessorOnly(). Yes, it's that easy, still not really obvious when you don't know it. Implementing IncludeFinderAction It should be clear now that IncludeFinderAction needs to derive from PreprocessOnlyAction, but what methods should it implement or override? Documentation mentions only PreprocessOnlyAction::ExecuteAction , so the choice is somewhat limited here and we need to overwrite exactly this method: Version of ExecuteAction() from parent class is invoked in the middle of our code as we want this to happen: Note usage of getCompilerInstance() in the code above. It comes from FrontendAction class and returns reference to CompilerInstance class which holds root objects that allow retrieval of all necessary information about source file processing. Preprocessor callbacks Some questions might arise when one is looking at the following lines: Particularly the following ones: There is one answer for both questions (well, almost): Preprocessor takes ownership over PPCallbacks object(s) passed to it. Actually, that was the first part of the answer, there would be no need to create anything if we could unsubscribe listener. So the second part is: callbacks can't be removed after they are added. This means that callbacks handler must be allocated on heap. It seems to be a design decision, because internally PPChainedCallbacks class is used and there are other similar classes, e.g. ChainedASTReaderListener . Such chained structures doesn't provide means for removing chains, only to add them and to call corresponding methods. Implementing callbacks Due to callback details described in the previous section callbacks need to be implemented with a proxy class. Here is how it works in general: Figure 1. Using proxy for preprocessor callbacks. And here is more detailed description: ExecuteAction() method creates CallbacksProxy class with a reference to corresponding IncludeFinder instance and hands it over to an instance of Preprocessor class (solid arrows). When interesting callbacks occur Preprocessor calls CallbacksProxy, which dispatches the call to IncludeFinder (dashed arrows). As for the list of callbacks, PPCallbacks currently has 30 of them and we need only one: PPCallbacks::InclusionDirective . It is called once for every #include (and alike) directive in the source code. The callback is called even when the file inclusion directive refers to doesn't exist. Seems to be exactly what we need. Processing inclusions There are two phases of processing here: The first phase is quite straightforward: Note SourceManager::isInMainFile() method, you might want to use it one day too. It's an easy way to filter out only those elements that are located in the main file that is processed (one of source files passed to the tool). This way we do not print files referenced by our includes, includes of our includes and so on. Apart from that we also extract line number in the source file using SourceManager::getSpellingLineNumber() method, which is also quite handy and simpler than another way of obtaining same information using FullSourceLoc as was shown in previous articles. The second phase doesn't have anything new about clang, but for completeness here are main points how check for include file is performed: Backward slashes (\\) in full path to the source file are replaced with forward slashes (/). Trailing component of the path is extracted, which should be filename. Extension of the file is removed to get its name only (part of file name without extension is usually called \"root\"). For each of found inclusion directives: The last check that is left is the primitive one: just check that the first element of our collection of includes is the one that corresponds to the source file. Testing Repository of the tool contains some [test files]. Let's try the tool on a couple of them. First with tests/good.cpp file: No output, as expected. Now take a look at tests/bad.cpp file: Output with truncated paths: Which is correct as well. Conclusion We've written another tool that enforces following good programming practices in C++ code. Although as of now it doesn't automatically guesses cases when header inclusion is completely missing in the file, the tool is already useful. Expected workflow with it can be as follows: Performing these actions, all source files should become self-contained. A simple rule that can significantly simplify building in future.

For the sake of clarity we will consider that our android application communicates with BLE kettle, which plays peripheral role. We have already discovered it and established connection. Time to move on. Discovering services Before we can use our kettle, we need to discover what it can do, and how. As you have already learnt, all communications are done via services and their characteristics. So we need to discover kettle services first. We initiate service discovery by calling DiscoverServices() method of BluetoothGatt instance. Discovery may take some time, after which OnServicesDiscovered() callback will be called. If discovery succeeds we have access to BluetoothGattService and BluetoothGatCharacteristic objects, which are android representation of BLE characteristics and services. If service discovery was successful we can iterate over all services and their characteristics of connected peripheral. You can also investigate what type of characteristic were discovered, by checking its permission and property fields. Permission field lets you see is characteristic access is encrypted. By checking property of characteristic you determine its features like writing, reading and so on. For instance we can check if discovered characteristic supports writing and has encryption in the following way: Some characteristics may not be visible through means of service discovery until you pair with device. We will discuss pairing in the next part of this article. Reading value Now we can check the temperature of water in a kettle, by reading out characteristic responsible for that. For reading values from the peripheral device we use readCharacteristic() method of BluetoothGatt instance. As an argument this method accepts BluetoothGattCharacteristic instance, representing previously discovered readable characteristic. The result of reading operation is observed in a gatt OnCharacteristicRead() callback. First we need to check the status of operation. If operation succeeded we obtain read value from characteristic object. The algorithm for reading descriptors is the same, what differs is the names of reading method and gatt callback. Writing value We have read temperature of our kettle, but it’s not hot enough. We want to remotely turn on our teapot for boiling. To do that we need to send data, considered by teapot as “ON command”. For writing values to peripheral device, BluetoothGatt instance provides writeCharacteristic() method, accepting as an argument discovered writable BluetoothGattCharacteristic . Before writing we need to configure write-characteristic, providing data for sending, and some other settings. Now we can tell BLE-Teapot to turn off and on. But how do we actually know that writing was successful? Specifically for this case you can specify what type of write you want to perform: Previously you saw writing without response. When you write with response, you tell the peripheral device, that you expect from it some kind of acknowledgment of operation success. That kind of write specified by setting characteristic WriteType property as GattWriteType .Default. Write acknowledgment is received by standard callback mechanism as previous Bluetooth events. In case of operation failure, response code can be obtained from status argument. Algorithm for writing descriptors is the same, except for calling methods. Value Notification Okay know we want to know when water in our kettle is boiled. Constantly polling current water temperature would be inefficient. Alternatively there are characteristics to which we can subscribe and be notified only when characteristic value changes. Subscribing to characteristic notification is done via SetCharacteristicNofication() method of BluetoothGattInstance object. As an arguments method accepts discovered BluetoothGattCharacteristic instance and a boolean, telling to enable or disable subscription. The result of subscribtion operation you can track in gatt OnDescriptorWritten() callback. If callback status is GattStatus.Success then we are successfully subscribed to characteristic notification. Now each time characteristic value changes OnCharacteristicChanged callback will be triggered. When we no longer need to be notified we can unsubscribe from characteristic by setting enable argument of SetCharacteristicNotification() method to false . Finale Now you have an idea of how services, characteristic and descriptors are presented in android and how to use them to get some data. All code examples presented in this article are used in a demo project, which you can download here .", "date": "2017-02-08"},

Calculation at compile-time with help of templates Introduction Hi! This is new chapter of my articles about C++. In previous few articles I have mentioned a lot things about templates. All this time I have described templates with type template arguments, but attentive reader could notice interesting thing with std::array in my article \"Haters gonna hate or life without pointers in C++11 times\". Remind the following code: std::array is template class which has storage type as its first template argument and the second... one minute... *value* of array dimension! Yes, you understand correctly that template argument can be non-type, but value. This topic is about such feature and how it can be used for mathematics calculations at compile time. Value as template argument or you can do a lot of compile- time Before happiness there is a restriction: template argument can be non-type only if it is an integer constant (including enumerations) and pointer to an object with external linkage. Other variants are forbidden at the moment. Let's investigate both cases. 1. Pointer to an object with external linkage. Here is an example with such value which is represented as array of characters: Let's take a look at such lines: (1.1) declaration of external array of characters; (1.2) declaration of template function which template argument is pointer to char; (1.3) call of this template function with external character array as template argument. As you see template argument isn't a type here. It is a pointer to external object. It is not in common practice and probably you won't use it, but the next case has a lot of use cases in real projects. 2. Integer constant. As non-type template argument can also be integer values, such as: char, short, int, long and their versions with unsigned keyword. It is very helpful when you need to generate code with a template which requires some constant value important for the class. Back to std::array<T, N>, T is template argument of item type in array and N is non-type template argument for dimension of array. Besides this such integer template argument can be used for calculation at compile time. My next example with calculation of factorial demonstrates it: In common words here is declaration of template class which has non-type template argument as int value and has specification when this value is 1 what provides calculation of factorial through template generation at compile text. Lets observe all step by step: (2.1) This line is declaration of template argument list which has int value as argument template. (2.2) This is the line which provides all calculations at compile time. As you see it multiplies non-type template argument with result of recursive instantiation of the same template, but its value is reduced by one. Result of calculation is written to enum item. It means expression of Factorial::result holds calculated value. (2.3) Here is specialization for template class Factorial when number value is equal to 1. This is used to stop recursive invocation of template generating on line (2.2). (2.4) 1 is terminal value of multiply series for factorial calculation. (2.5) This is the line where all magic takes place. When compiler gets to this line, it will generate few templates: Factorial, Factorial, Factorial and Factorial. From the last specified template class Factorial to the first Factorial will be calculated sequence of Factorial::result value: 1 in Factorial::result, 2 in Factorial::result, 6 in Factorial::result, 24 in Factorial::result. Actually compile puts just 24 in standard output stream and nothing else. At run-time there aren't any calculations. Thus at run-time this strange code is equal to: But such calculation is made at compile time and at run time it looks like the following code: Isn't it awesome? With help of non-type template argument, recursively instantiation of templates, specialization we can make calculation with loops and conditions. Moreover thanks to such capabilities, templates are full Turing machine. It means that every mathematics function can be calculated. You probably understand that floating point types can't be used here as input non-type argument. But it doesn't have any technical obstacles. In future of C++ it can be provided. As another bad news - it makes building of project slower, but sometimes it is good practice to take some code from run-time and do in at compile time. Extended example of compile-time calculation or on the way to get exponentiation Let's consolidate and increase the new knowledge with another example of calculation at compile time. This time it is calculation of exponentiation. It is a binary operation, so it requires more template arguments for calculations. Let's see implementation and discuss it: So there are: (3.1) Template argument list with three non-type arguments. All of them are integer values. They are: base - base of exponentiation, degree is power of exponentiation, multiply_adder is variable which holds result of multiplying base on itself \"degree\" times. PowerImpl is implementation of getting exponentiation by itself. (3.2) As in the example with Factorial here we write result of recursive instantiation of template PowerImpl to result enum. As you probably understand we reduce degree by one every time we multiply multiply_adder by base value. (3.3) This is specification for end condition of recursively generation of template classes. You have to catch that this time we specify second argument of template argument list. Specification of templates doesn't have restriction in which order to specify template arguments. This allows to use it for stopping when degree is reduced to zero. It means that multiply_adder stores intermediate value of exponentiation. (3.4) This template class is a wrapper for PowerImpl, because the last one requires value 1 as the third argument and end user might not understand what to pass as the last template argument. (3.5) This line holds what we have hidden from end user of class Power and we save result of calculation to enum item. (3.6) Line shows how end user uses our class for exponentiation calculation. It is the same story as with calculation of Factorial - after compiling in generated assembler code there will be just printing of value 64 to standard output. This is how another simple mathematics entity can be found at compile time. In the next part of the article I will complicate mathematics calculation with already written entities. Get simple mathematics series or increase level of compile-time madness Now we have implemented calculation of factorial and exponentiation. I am proposing to write calculation of such mathematics series at compile time: Let's begin to implement this with Summator class which will make sum of some function from 1 to N. Some function will be set as template class in argument list. It is something new, let's check it out in the following code: As usual I will begin with the first marked line: (4.1) TypeData is template argument which is used for setting non-type template argument for template argument. Don't get it? See the next line. (4.2) class T is our template class that calculates some function which is passed as its template argument. This technique is called nesting of templates and it can be unsupported in some compilers that have restriction on level of nesting. TypeData is used for specifying type of arguments in template argument list of class T. The first argument is input value for function and the second one is current index of mathematics series. (4.3) This is input value for mathematics series. (4.4) An index of current calculated item of series. (4.5) There are two new things. The first is that we hold result of sum in constant static variable with double type. Because of division in our mathematics series we need to store result as value with floating point. const and static modifiers provide us to save necessary results at compile time. The second new thing is call of instantiation template argument class, but actually it looks as usual instantiation of template. It is worth noting that when we set this template class at instantiation of Summator, T will be replaced with name of class at compile time. And there will be instantiation of this template class. (4.6) This line must be well known for you. It is another recursively instantiation of our Summator, but with reduced index argument. (4.6) This class must be well acquainted for you - it is end condition for our Summator. It just initiates our template argument class with value and the first index of mathematics series. Now it is easy to implement mathematics series which I have wanted. We need to write template class which calculates our mathematics function [xn / n!] and some wrapper for encapsulating of instantiation our Summator with our mathematics function. Here is the implementation: (5.1) SignleSerie is class for calculation of n item, generally it is our mathematics function f(x)_n = (x^n / n!) (5.2) There is instantiation of Power<x,n>::result - nothing new. (5.3) There is instantiation of Factorial::result, but probably you will ask why it is necessary to multiply by 1.0. Power<x,n>::result and Factorial::result have enum type which will be cast to integer value, but in this case we will lost fraction part of the number. For preventing this we must cast one of division operand to floating point type. Value 1.0 does it. Thus we get calculated value without losing any information. (5.4) MathSeries is a wrapper of instantiation necessary templates to calculate result of target mathematics series with given \"value\" \"count\" times. (5.5) This is what we encapsulate in the wrapper - instantiation of Summator with SignleSerie as target mathematics function. Usage of all this hell looks like an angel, see: User works just with MathSeries<X, N> template class which encapsulates few entities at the same timee: Factorial, Power<base, degree>, Summator<TypeData, class T, value, i> and SingleSerie<x, n>. All these entities calculate values at compile time. Cool? Indeed. Conclusion This time I have told about such amazing thing with templates as calculation at compile time. Indeed templates have rich means for providing mathematics operations, which proves that templates in C++ are full Turing machine. It is provided by non-type template arguments, specialization and constant static values. On the other hand such implementation can be complicated and increases time for building process. But it helps to move some logic from run-time to compile-time and speed up performance of an application. Examples of code from the article you can find in my Github repository.

There is also a version of this article in Russian. Event-driven design is a powerful and flexible approach for developing JavaScript applications. This paradigm is gaining popularity and increasingly being featured in many frameworks. This popularity comes with a drawback: As the size of the application grows, The number of events, triggers, and subscriptions does too, rapidly becoming far harder to manage. Facing a similar problem on a recent project, we initially used the standard development tool - search. But over time the throw pillows on sale of events expectedly increased, and the search for events became a lot more complex, time-consuming, and tedious. Another substantial problem was managing unpaired triggers or subscriptions, which had a tendency to also reproduce. We found that development was slowing and the code was becoming uglier and harder to understand as more of these guys cropped up. Consider the following situation - you come to a new project that uses event-based architecture. How much time you will need to fully track all events and their chain of subscriptions? From our experience, this process consumes lots of time, so in order to simplify it, we sought to unify the search for all events into one interactive report. How Capo Simplifies Tracking of Event Triggers and Subscriptions Designed over the last two years, Capo attacks this problem directly. The module controls trigger – subscription links in event-driven architecture remove this basic uncertainty and improve the usability of the Mediator template. The tagline of the capo module is “All string are touched” which unites it with the guitar mediator referenced in the logo. Capo is not a method or approach, but rather a ready-to-go assistant implemented as an npm module and a plugin for Sublime Text. Capo performs a search across all the files in a specified folder, finds all publish-subscribe links and helps the user control and manage them. For convenience, it displays these results as an flexible HTML report. For a live display: http://msemenistyi.github.io/capo/ In the left side you can easily navigate through found events and observe the corresponding triggers and subscribers with file name, line and context specified. In the “Strange events” section, events that are either missing a trigger or subscriber are located. Capo may be used with mediator.js, Backbone.js, node.js EventEmitter or any other object that provides publish-subscribe interface. Additionally, reports can be sent to the printer or directly to console via capo-cli, and it's easy to add build steps in grunt via grunt-capo . The spy generator can assign dummy subscribers to unpaired events. It generates spy.js file in the capo folder: This script contains subscriptions to all the triggers found in the project (filtered by event name if defined). spyHandler function serves as a handler for all the subscriptions. By default, the handler contains event name logging when triggered, but it may be changed to anything as preferable. To integrate these features within the development environment, we created a Sublime Text 3 plugin that will help to make life easier. After installing (Install Package – Capo) you can just use the default shortcut to run a search (Alt+D) and using the quick panel, select the needed file. The plugin will open a new window and select the line with found event. Our first goal while creating Capo was to make the development process easy for ourselves, as well as to help new guys on the project quickly understand application architecture. By helping to address the huge weakness of uncertain event triggers/subscribers, we hope that this will also help others in the same way as it helped us, and encourage the effective use of the mediator pattern. For everyone who found this article, we would like to invite you to an upcoming March 6 Hangout to talk about Capo and other ways to handle event driven JS architecture.

It is quite hard to argue with math and having around 90 people in the list for webinar, we ended with only 23 watchers. Most probably you will talk to just 30% of those registered. 2. Prepare useful content Even before the start of your PR campaign you should pick the topic of your webinar. You should make sure that it is of current interest and you have enough knowledge in this area to answer any of the questions asked. My personal opinion is that you should be an expert in the topic you’ve picked and your knowledge should exceed the knowledge of 95% of watchers. Therefore, my topic for webinar was ‘Event-driven JS’, which is my favorite programming approach: I’ve contributed to popular modules implementing it and created my own module for simplification of dealing with it. After you’ve chosen the topic you will need to create the outline for the whole webinar. I don’t think that you should create script for all the duration of broadcasting but you should rather achieve the condition when you feel confident during the webinar and know which part follows next for sure. Presentations may be very helpful in this case and it is a good idea to have 5 to 10 slides in your presentation so that you could present the theory behind your topic with their help before moving to practice. 3. Language Choosing the language for the webinar may be tricky if you live in not an English-speaking country, because most probably majority of your audience will speak the other language. If you feel confident in English and you know that audience is good in it too, it is the best choice for sure. What you however should do is look for synonyms and introductory phrases, which will make your speech more enjoyable. The factor, which finally persuaded us, was the video we wanted to be recorded from webinar and it definitely had to be presented in English as it expands the number of people who can understand you drastically. 4. Video recording If you want to record your webinar, you must be well-grounded for it. You are likely to face problems with audio settings for both input and output streams. Google Hangouts offer you stream to YouTube and the video will be available even after the stream ends, but for most of other platforms you will have to handle it yourself. There is plenty of such software on the internet, here are just some of them: Remember, that you will end up without video if you do not pay enough attention to it. During my webinar I forgot to start record of the first half and for the second one software failed with error. 5. Webinar platform One of the most important choices you will face will be the platform for hosting your webinar. We chose Google Hangouts, as it seemed to be very promising. Google invested a lot of effort in Hangouts as one of the killer-features of Google+. Still I tend to think that this choice was a mistake. In the middle of webinar the broadcasting was interrupted with a message of server error. The most painful point was that there was no possibility to restart Hangout on Air saving the link to it. We had to initiate a new event and share a new link to it. It all ended up losing around 10 minutes and 6 listeners. Another painful point is communication between trainer and the people who attended the webinar. There is Q&A plugin available for Hangout on Air but it just means text questions and oral answer which is not applicable for classical webinar which actually expects existing of individual person who answers the questions. Possible variants we would pay attention in the future to are: Despite all its complexity in organization, I believe that webinar is totally worth it. It will bring your audience new knowledge, you will get the satisfaction of public speaking and your company will gain high esteem for that.

But in some cases threads can be blocked. External script in <head> section may block downloading subsequent resources. This is why it is better to include all cascade style sheets in the beginning of <head> section, and all external scripts at the end ( Properly including stylesheets and scripts ). The other way is to use “defer” and “async” html attributes, which force browser to download scripts in asynchronous mode. Dynamic script linking There are several ways to link external scripts dynamically: The worst is document.write(), as it blocks DOMLoaded event from triggering. Using document.createElement() is better, as it doesn’t block DOMLoaded event. But it shows page loading indicator at the top of page. The best solution is to use XMLHttpRequest. It provides total control on script loading process. Reflow/relayout To speed up DOM manipulation routines modern browsers use separate rendering tree. When script modifies some DOM properties no reflow/relayout occurs. Affected elements in render tree are just marked as “dirty”. Relay out occurs only when page is (re)drawn or when script tries to read property of “dirty” element. One should remember that undue reading of DOM properties may lead to continue reflow. So it is much faster to read and calculate all required values first and only then update, than to update during reading. ( Minimizing browser reflow ).

Let us investigate benefits of outsourcing software development. Why is it so popular today? The answer is regional economic peculiarities. Local prices for goods and services are different all over the world. It is well known that regions with more developed economics and industry and better opportunities for business usually have very high prices for labor. Naturally, businesses are always trying to cut costs for projects as much as possible. The first and the most obvious step in this case is searching for employees from other locations with the same level of skills but lower fees. While earlier this problem was solved by importing labor force or moving businesses to regions with cheaper labor costs (both ways include certain difficulties), today we have got another great option, remote working. Beginning from the late 1990s home PCs with access to the Internet became a common thing almost worldwide, so technically a programmer living in Ukraine can be involved at work in an outsourcing web development project for a Germany-based company together with several other people which actually reside in different corners of the world. Remote work via the Internet dramatically increases the opportunity of offshoring software development, giving company owners lots of new options to cut costs. The virtual space allows users interact and cooperate with each other in real time without any obstacles, and that saves huge amount of time and money in the means of business. But when you get something, you always pay for it. Remote work and overall interaction via the Web brings some serious issues which may cause negative effects. Let us investigate main problems a software development company willing to outsource its project may face. Briefly: As we can see, the question of personal contact is very serious in software outsourcing. Strong ties, active cooperation, rich feedback cause synergic effect in this area. Their absence is really bad for the development efficiency and finally makes the financial gain of outsourcing the project doubtful. That is why communication, team interaction and active ideas exchange must take very much place in software outsourcing (especially in website development when specific details of the design could be discussed endlessly). It should be even more intensive than interaction in a regular team because the disadvantages of remote conversation should be compensated somehow. How can you ensure high efficiency of your custom software development or web development project when outsourcing it? If you have some experience in that field you can contact your trusted outsourcing partners and cooperate with people you already worked with. If you want to find a new contributor, you need to make a list of your demands to him first (programming languages, skills, level of English, geographic location). Of course you will search for those outsourcing software development companies which are frequently mentioned in the Web and are better known for the their quality of teamwork organization. We in Binary Studio consider the quality of teambuilding and interactive work organization to be crucial for successful software development outsourcing. Being oriented at long-term cooperation, our company pays much attention to systematic measures to raise teamwork efficiency. We are located in Donetsk, a big industrial and engineering center of the former Soviet Union, which has strong economic and cultural ties with Germany, France, UK and other developed European countries. So we can choose among a lot of skilled young developers with higher education when building teams for our outsourcing projects. Fluent English and strong abilities for teamwork are our priorities. That is why we have a number of successfully fulfilled projects and satisfied customers with our software development services. And we are ready for new exciting experience in outsourcing software development!

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "why-hire-net-developers", "author": ["Binary Studio"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2011/10/03/why-hire-net-developers/", "abstract": "Why hire .Net Developers (dot Net Developer) or a dedicated ASP.Net programmer? It is a really big question for a software development company which is about to start a new .NET application project: is it better to find freelancer programmers or hire a full-time professional? It is good to have a choice. As for employment and staff management, there are many ways to choose from thanks to the progress in communication technologies. On the other hand, the variety of employment forms corresponds to diversity of peculiarities of different businesses. It is clearly visible in .NET development which is one of the most active IT market niches today. Microsoft continues holding leading positions in rapidly growing software development market, so .NET projects are widespread in this industry. That is why thousands of HRs all over the world are exploring job websites each day in order to hire .NET developers. Remote working is a strong trend nowadays. It is quite a common situation when one team member is located at the office in San Francisco, another one is working from a hotel room in Dresden, the third one occupies a flat in Kiev, and all three of them are busy over their (dot) .net project and are interacting all the time. Besides, there are lots of tools for enhancing the quality of remote working and sharing the knowledge between team members. They make offshore web development much easier to organize. Still, a businessman never follows a trend only because it is innovative or popular. What corporations do first of all is persuading their specific needs and general interests, which include three major principles: The question of team building and employment of “Dot Net developers” (.net developers) directly correlates with that. Each CEO or project manager adopts the scheme of forming his ASP.Net development team judging by a specific situation. Some prefer seeking for freelancers who will work remote, while others choose to hire .NET developers for full-time work in an office. So let us investigate the main reasons to hire .NET developers for remote full-time work at the office. They are in brief: As we can see, the reasons above (explaining why hire .net developers), correlate with a certain model of team building in Dot .Net development. It is a known fact that team building and communication can be quite easily performed via email, chats, wikis, phones or video calls. Together with many preferences of the remote full-time work, that makes a great alternative. Of course the classic way of keeping all the staff in one office remains popular. But today more and more corporations prefer to hire remote .NET application development teams because their specific needs are best met by using this employment model. So, the remote employment has become a real alternative today. Internet connects people from different countries and continents, enabling them cooperate remotely. In modern programming industry the amount of developers, software engineers and QA testers working as freelancers is very high and even small and startup companies starts to hire .net developers that reside in offshore locations. It is important to understand that hiring freelancer always means taking some risk. So in order to hire dedicated .NET developers for a full-time remote work, you should consider using help of trusted outsourcing services providers. If you want to hire a .NET developer, Binary Studio can help you build a dedicated ASP .Net developer (programmer) team.", "date": "2015-04-01"},

Having considerable (in the means of IT world) history, PHP continues gaining positions in the Web development industry, being a commonly used language for creation of dynamic web pages. At the moment PHP-based pages happen to be a major fraction among the world’s most popular websites. For example, a survey covering the top 1 000 000 websites according to Alexa shows that PHP is running on more than 76% of all the servers analyzed. That figure includes such popular services as Facebook, Wikipedia, WordPress.com, Baidu.com and others. Such a trend doubtlessly involves more and more PHP start-ups coming up in the nearest future. Therefore more and more employers will be willing to hire a PHP developer and many of them will seek the services of remote outsourcing services providers operating in the web development field. When it comes to outsourcing (which serves the need to hire a PHP developer working remote), Binary Studio has much to offer its actual and potential customers. Our company has been performing in the PHP development field since its foundation. We are highly concerned about supporting the highest level of our PHP department in order to make its work more efficient. Two main methods are adopted for that. The first one is usage of up-to-date and trusted development tools. Our PHP programmers use to employ most effective tools and techniques for their daily tasks. Zend and Symphony are most popular PHP frameworks at Binary Studio as these systems proved to be reliable and handy enough for building web projects of high quality with their help. Another method of improvement is based upon the concept that it’s never too late to learn. Our PHP developers are constantly trying to enhance level of their skills and learn something new. Attending conferences and seminars related to software development tips and techniques, as well as sharing the knowledge with colleagues via team meetings, is quite a tradition for Binary Studio crew. You can check our blog to know more about our recent professional training activities and read technical articles about web development techniques we use. You are welcome to join discussions! PHP department is the second greatest part of Binary Studio, and its members are working with their customers for a long time already, since Binary favors long-term partnerships. Our PHP department professionals have accomplished a lot of successful projects up to this day. A good example of fruitful collaboration is our participation in Shin File Share project. Our customer, Shin Software, is an Italian consulting and software development company. The goal was to create a flexible and secure online tool for file sharing and collaboration. It was decided to hire a PHP developer who would work remote with this project. So, Shin needed a nearshore contributor with high level of PHP development skills and with aptitude for strong teamwork and creative approach to the task. As a result, a high quality product was created. Our clients highly evaluate the cooperation. They say that they had come through some unsatisfying experience when using the services of outsourcing companies before contacting Binary Studio in 2009 and after we began working together, they adopted much better opinion for software outsourcing in general. You can get more details about our work over the Shin Project here. As you can see we also have more successfully accomplished web development projects to tell about. The PHP development is our major area of interest as the world usage of this language continues to buster. As our senior PHP developer Andrew commented on the subject, ‘While a decade ago great PHP start-ups were quite rare, today the situation has changed radically. PHP usage is constantly growing; new improved versions are released regularly. We have now a lot of open source CMSs, including Drupal and Joomla, which makes PHP really attractive for people’. Andrew himself started using PHP several years ago for some web design projects he worked at, and now he has notable experience in Zend Framework. In his opinion, PHP possesses high potential as it is open-source and could become a good choice for many ambitious web start-ups. To tell the truth, the free code sources can help starting programmers a great deal. Today there are many people operating in this field. An employer willing to hire a PHP developer should choose carefully in order to acquire a highly-skilled professional for his project. An offshore PHP development team could be quite a good choice as you don’t have to perform hiring and training procedures yourself. Our company, possessing substantial experience in building high class PHP teams for numerous customers from US and Western Europe, is glad to offer you such a possibility. So don’t hesitate – we will help you to hire a PHP developer or will even provide you with an extremely skilled team of dedicated PHP developers.

Building a software development project includes a number of serious steps. One of them is finding good staff and putting them together. Perhaps the project manager will decide to hire development team. Ukraine is one of the most suitable places for that. Let us discover why. Where To Find Developers? The universal demand for skilled software development resources is growing day by day. Numerous IT enterprises and start-ups in Western Europe and North America need more brains. Naturally, this causes shortage of local resources, so more and more IT projects are outsourced. The world outsourcing industry has rather long history; so many countries are now active players in this field. A project owner looking for foreign contributors has to select a destination first. Different locations have different peculiarities which make them more or less suitable for a certain task. Eastern Europe has become a rather popular outsourcing destination lately. Especially it is true for Western European customers. Ukrainian Software Development Resources Being maybe the cheapest place in the region, Ukraine is well involved into the world IT industry development process. Programmers are a big part of local labor resources. Consequently the number of IT outsourcing services companies is growing very fast. So you’ll have a broad choice in case you want to hire development team in Ukraine. Recent researches by CEEOA (Central and Eastern European Outsourcing Association) and other organizations have shown that Ukraine is one of the most promising outsourcing services providers in Eastern European region. Ukraine got close attention by European outsourcing analytics agencies in 2009 - 2011. Country’s notable success in the IT outsourcing helped it to get a number of awards. They include: •    TOP 50 Emerging Global Outsourcing Destinations in 2009 •    Gaming Industry’s TOP 12 European Countries in 2009 •    TOP 20 Leading Countries in the area of IT Outsourcing and High-Tech Services in 2010 •    Outsourcing destination of the year in 2011 As we can see, Ukrainian IT community makes certain progress in the European IT outsourcing field. Given that cost-saving trends are anticipated to be dominating the world IT sector in the nearest future, more and more Western European enterprises are likely to consider the idea to hire development team from Ukraine. How Much It Will Cost? This progress was based on a number of opportunities local IT sector offers. First of all it is a dramatically low average developer fee. Ukraine is not a EU member so prices and salaries here create very attractive circumstances for western IT companies. Anyone who decided to hire development team in Ukraine could not miss to notice such a big difference and evaluate opportunities it creates for IT projects. Below is a chart representing Ukraine’s position among other countries of the world software development outsourcing pool. It is based upon a small research that was recently performed by Binary Studio – our company examined a number of our peers in order to find out their prices. Closer Look At Ukrainian IT Resources Of course, a strong IT sector cannot appear from nothing. Former USSR’s technical education system used to have a good reputation in the world. Still the country had managed to maintain the level of engineering culture during these years. In the 2000s Ukraine managed to enter the TOP 10 countries with the most certified IT professionals. Keeping such a position is a real challenge for the local IT community. Actually, software development is becoming more and more popular among students each year. As a result, local IT outsourcing services providers are constantly supplied with skilled and enthusiastic people. So, you’ll definitely find whom to hire. Development teams which Ukraine provides are widely known for the quality of their work. Binary Studio: Our Teambuilding Experience Binary Studio as a leading Ukrainian outsourcing vendor is concerned about the progress of local IT community and software development outsourcing industry in general. We believe that sharing experience brings benefits to everyone. We have been long helping our foreign customers to hire development team in Ukraine. An example of a successful teambuilding project we had is the partnership with Shin Software company. The task was to develop a digital document, Shin FileShare. As our customer needed a team of programmers, our task was to perform search and interviewing of candidates, training and management. Besides, our customer had already experienced an unsuccessful partnership with an Indian outsourcing company. So Binary Studio had to work hard in order to prove that it is really effective to hire development teams in Ukraine. As a result, a reliable, flexible and highly scalable framework was created for the project (it was called Shin Framework). The solution was successfully developed and our customer got a challenging product, as well as the bright experience of outsourcing to Ukraine. You can get more details at the corresponding Case Study . Are you willing to know more about outsourcing to Eastern Europe? Or considering to hire development team in Ukraine?

They start from scratch and end up next day with usable software. More than 15 teams out more than 10 different IT companies had registered for the event, but only 12 held up till the end. The teams had different but interesting  ideas for their projects, among which were fun, useful and even weird ones J Some of the teams gave up at night, some left right before the demo had started not willing to show incomplete project realization. Binary Studio team called “Narkomanda” consisted of 9 developers from .Net, Lamp and Mobile departments. Apart from that, one more team had our representative from C++ department. It was a great opportunity for our employees to code and share their experience one the one hand and to socialize and chill out together on the other. It was great to code all night long side by side and to meet the sunrise on our terrace with really beautiful view! Apart from this it was really nice to see our Academy project graduates at the event, who came to help their former tutors and stayed with Binary Studio till the end of Hackathon. But the most important thing is that their efforts were not vain, our teams won first two out of three prize-winning places! Great result, isn't it?

These topics are very interesting for me because our current project includes using the abovementioned technologies. . Besides, personally I am a huge fan of Microsoft. Opening speech contained many words about great future of Ukraine as world outsourcing center. After that sessions started. There were 5 sessions in the same time but in different halls and each participant could choose most appropriate for him. Foreign speakers were the best as usual. For instance, the talk about correlation between test management and code quality by Rex Black was very inspiring. It was one more opportunity to reconsider views about software testing. I also had a little chat with Rex during coffee-break. Another speech that is firmly fixed in my memory was about software architects. Speaker was a very experienced man and I understood that it is not just words; he really went a long way to current architect position. And of course I visited all Windows-related sessions. Everyone in Ukraine who is interested in Windows Phone knows Oleksandr Krakovetskyy and his project Windows Phone 7 Rocks . Oleksandr was talking about new features in upcoming Windows Phone 8.

Binary Studio team is back from one of the most exciting adventures we’ve ever had. Most of our guys went to explore few of the most beautiful European cities and enjoy the most charming time of the year - Christmas.  So let me give you a short insight of one of our brightest team-building events ever! The idea of a corporate Euro tour came from our CEO – Artyom Goncharov, who also covered the good half of all expenses as a compliment to each employee of Binary Studio for the great results achieved this year. At first it was pretty difficult to decide upon the route, schedule and the general agenda. But Kate - our HR specialist took her time to research on the topic and chose the most competitive touristic company who provided us with the service. We couldn’t make up our mind concerning any of the ready-made tour offers; therefore we had to tailor our agenda ourselves. And so we decided to get to Kiev by train and then switch to bus. Our first sop would be Prague (Czech Republic), next Munich (Germany), Krakow (Poland) and Lvov (Ukraine). So there we were -  20+ enthusiastic youngsters armed with warm plaids, soft pillows, dozens of movies and overwhelming excitement! Unfortunately, the weather was pretty snowy and freezing, so we failed to meet the schedule in the beginning of the trip and came to Prague only late in the evening. However nothing could stop us from a great wish to explore the first check point of our journey. So we went to the city center around 10 p.m. The crowd got out of tube on the Museum station and walked the main street up to Staromestskaya square with its famous astronomic watch, but to our great disappointment, we found all of the Christmas Market closed.  With nothing left to do, we had a bite at KFC as if to get charged before the long night. Next sight to see was one of the most impressive and romantic places in whole Europe – Charles Bridge.  After a long and pretty cold sightseeing it was the right time to taste some of the best Czech Beers and warm wine in one of the numerous Prague bars. Obviously we got to the hotel towards dawn and had to sleep in the bus on our way to the southern perl of Germany – Munich. We had 2 more days to stay in this incredible city of Bayern, one of the wealthiest districts of Germany, which combines highly developed infrastructure with historical heritage; beers with sausages; BMW with Oktoberfest; heavenly Alps with indigo blue lakes and much…much…MORE.

Of course this attitude may just be caused by the dozens of Beers we drank, but I will try to make you feel the atmosphere of what we’ve been through. The hotel we booked was situated in the very heart of the city right next to Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Staion ) and Stachus where the shopping street with its numerous Christmas Market booths begins.  Right after our arrival we went on the sightseeing city tour with a very experienced guide who showed us some of the most interesting places such as BMW museum, Olympic Park, Allianz Arena Stadium, Ludwig-Maximillian University and the great Castle Nimphenburg. Back to the city center - the seething crowd mixed with a group of Binary Studio guys  stopped by the huge Christmas tree to enjoy the cinnamon smelling hot wine and crusty, fatty sausages! That is something I highly recommend! During the two days spent in Munich we got to know major historic events, ruling dynasties as well as traditions of Bavaria not to mention that we visited most famous breweries such as Hofbrauhaus, Augustiner and Spatehaus . On our second day in Munich we had a whole-day getaway to the Alps. We started with an excursion to Schloss Neuschwanstein, the castle built on the rock in the middle of the mountain chain. Having learned a lot about one of the wisest and generous Kings of Bayern - Ludwig the 2 nd , we went back to enjoy the mountain view while eating the most delicious doughnuts in the world and drinking heating and incredibly tasty hot wine in the street, just down the road from the castle. Next destination of the day was Oberammergau - a small, cute village with just a couple of streets, where people live in fairytale houses and know everyone by name.  We went to a small restaurant to taste some of the authentic homemade dishes. As we had to make sure we visited all the super cool bars or breweries in the city center, our last night in Munich finished at 5.30 a.m. and at 8 we were already heading to Krakow, Poland.  The city, though small is full of historical spirit which makes you understand that this is the city of Kings. Actually all the Kings of Poland were crowned here in Krakow. The same day on our way home we made a short stop in Lviv, one of the oldest Ukrainian cities. As everyone was hungry and died to get some hot Borsch, we went to very specific restaurant - Kyrijinka. Which is first of all – difficult to find as there’s no sign of the entrance and you can come in only if you tell the password. Moreover, the place is designed as dugout and is full of nationalistic symbols. But the best thing about it is that we had a chance to cure the cold (most of us had) with hot Borsch, spicy lard and Medovukha (vodka with honey). This stuff is the best medicine for any Ukrainian, you know 🙂 Back home, we felt the trip did what it was supposed to. We had dozens of funny stories to tell, hundreds of photos to show and countless emotions to share!

On February 16-17 th we are going to work hard throughout the weekend on architecture and design of complex web applications. Rich functionality, high load, quick data growth, high dynamics of changes, frequently changing requirements - all this needs a flexible, stable, and what`s more important - as simple as possible and transparent architecture of the software available for implementation and development by developers of different levels. Wrong, distorted, heterogeneous in its ideology architecture is dangerous. First of all, the fact that it is difficult and not easy to develop and support leads to the situation when the team no longer \"loves\" and is not “proud” of their project and starts working simply exchanging their time for money, completely demotivated. In the majority of such cases the project rapidly morally and technically becomes outdated and its development is no longer possible. How can you save the situation? At the moment there exist numerous architecture patterns and approaches to designing. How can you select the one suitable for your project and the team? What should you do if you are not the original architect and got distorted, not homogeneous and not stable solution difficult in the development and support? The training will give all the answers and will provide the participants with information about: At the end of the training each participant will get an individual homework to consolidate and sum up the info and will have the opportunity to check it with the speaker on line after the event.

This time it took two long but very informative days. Dmitriy Efimenko software architect held the training devoted to complex web application design andon the first day gave the answers to lots of questions, such as: The second day was totally devoted to practice i.e. the team was supposed to design simple architecture of the complex system. Dmitry was a customer, with a very vague project description. Having managed to understand the aim of the system we started questioning our customer in order to get more details about the service and got down to work designing our system. The application involved multiple roles, connections and calls which made the task extremely difficult. 3 hours and 15 flipchart paper sheets later we discussed each solution and together came up with the best one. Of course the main aim of the training was to improve skills of our experienced developers in architecture design. However, the coach also touched upon the issues of team spirit, which he insists is crucially important for the project success. Moreover, Dmyrtiy reminded us of the importance of customer - vendor relationships. According to the coach a developer should understand the general aim of the project well. i.e. development is more of an aim and not task-oriented process. Such approach will decrease a number of questions and misunderstandings which usually take place in the process of cooperation. Here are some comments on the training: Dmytriy, Leading .Net developer @Binary Studio Sergey, Head of PHP department @Binary Studio Egor, Leading PHP developer @Binary Studio \"Team is the best value for the company.

A particular thing about the contest was that parts of the Cup (Top Speed Coding, Team and Individual tournaments, and programming of robots) were mixed with master-classes and lectures from the partner-companies and sponsors. Though Binary Studio was the only IT company which supported Donetsk National University to hold the event, the contest turned out really interesting and was on a very good level. Three developers from Binary Studio (Constantin, Nikita Sh. and Nikita S.) prepared a master class on “Development of real time web applications using coffee script and node.js stack”, which impressed both the students and the employees of Binary Studio who came to the cup to support our speakers. The winner was the team from the Donetsk National University who also got the presents from Binary Studio. Apart from that during the Cup we opened Binary Studio Academy 2013 and had the first qualifying test for the Academy, which the contestants passed quite well and we already have a few potential trainees.

This means you are invited to take part in our “Academy program”. It was primarily established as a course, which challenges to cut the distance between a university graduate and a real-life developer, i.e. all classes aim at giving you as much information about modern technologies and methodologies of program development as possible. Moreover every new piece of knowledge will be supported by homework. And at the end of the program you will be given two weeks to complete a project of your own, which will also serve as a final test. When the project is checked we will decide upon the participants who will be offered to take junior positions at our company. The idea is – you study, we provide you with necessary knowledge, the best and most talented get the job. We decided to have two groups, according to our major departments, - .Net and PhP. Most of the classes will take place in different time, but we expect to have some common, general classes for both groups as well. All the information concerning studying process, as well as the schedule will be shared during the first lecture. Classes are to start on Saturday, the 2 nd of July at 10 o’clock. You’ll be given a call to confirm your awareness.  All following classes are to take place on Saturdays too and you are to have 2 max 4 classes each Saturday, though the time might vary. Naturally you will be notified in advance. We suppose the studying process will be finished by 20 th of August. But there will surely follow a consulting Saturday (27 th August) afterwards, for you to have an opportunity to clarify all the issues you have got. Next step is to hand in your projects on 10 th of September.

It makes a general introduction into this undoubtedly very promising technology introduced by Microsoft. Today I’d like to tell you about Silverlight. First of all, what is Silverlight? In official Microsoft site about this technology we can read: Microsoft Silverlight is a free runtime that powers rich application experiences and delivers high quality, interactive video across multiple platforms and browsers, using the .NET framework. You can use the link http://silverlight.net/ to get more information and working applications on Silverlight. The current version of Silverlight is 3.0 Beta (and though it is still a young technology, we already managed to have some experience with it. So if you're looking for silverlight development services, please check our page about our services ). It is supported on the following OS: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Mac OSX 10.4. And now we can use Silverlight 1.0 verison on Linux platform via Moonlight 1.0 project. Also Silverlight is supported on following web browsers: Internet Explorer 6.0/7.0/8.0, Mozilla Firefox 1.5/2.0/3 and Safari 3.1. In the plans: Windows Mobile 6 and Symbian (Series 60) and Opera. I won’t compare Silverlight with other similar technologies because you can find that in almost all blogs about this technology. I just can say, that seems Microsoft has managed to develop a very powerful competitor of Flash and the like, making the web even more beautiful, with the beauty easy to create and maintain. So, for me choice was obvious — Silverlight! I used the following arguments: As you can see Silverlight isn't the technology only for creating beautiful effects. You can develop very difficult business applications and use all the power of .NET Framework and Azure Services Platform. More information about this technology you can find following these links: http://silverlight.net/ http://silverlighter.ru/ http://www.microsoft.com/SILVERLIGHT/ http://silverlight.live.com/ and other blogs.

Here you can find sample functions with tests and table with pros and cons based on our experience of using test driven software development.You can make your own decision of using TDD in your application development processes after reading the article. Recently there is a lot of discussion around agile technologies in general and TDD in particular. As it is heavily used in our team, I’d like to say a couple of words about it too. First, I want to speak a bit about Unit-testing in general. If you want to create big and well-working application, you need to test it, because even very good programmers make mistakes. You have two ways to solve that: But even if you have a crowd of beta-testers, you still need to add automation to test process. It allows your crowd of testers spent more time to test functionality. What is a unit-testing? Imagine that your program consists of functions. For example, you need a program to find area of circle. You can write something like that: Now you naturally want to check if this is right. Add something like that, if you think, that errors need to be checked too: So, you can run all tests and check if everything is ok or something is broken. Sounds good till now, isn’t it? But if you have to test code which depends on some data, you need to prepare some data before test and clean it after that. For that purpose you can use keywords [SetUp], [TestFixtureSetUp], [TearDown], [TestFixtureTearDown]. You may need to create too much test stuff: test users, test configurations, test data etc. For example, our code in a part of a big project looks like this: [SetUp] ClearClient() and SetupClient() contains a lot of other code, which we use. So, preparation and cleanup test data can take a lot of your time. N.B. In big projects previous tests can affect next ones. In our practice there were situations, when single a test was green, but if you run whole fixture, it broke. This can signal you have bad SetUp in  that test or some of previous tests hadn't cleared necessary data. The search of such errors is hard work. So, I want to give table with pros and cons of TDD: In all cases you should remember: “There is no silver bullet”. For our team and for our products this approach works perfect and I believe if you didn’t try it yet, you should – the chances you’ll like it are very high.

What is the  key to successful sales? These questions are being covered in this  article. Sales, sales. We all want to make money. And we all are looking for  clients, buying our products, services and actually helping us make  these money. So when communicating with people, going to these  networking events, we actually come there to do business, aren’t we? Yes, correct. The only point is that people are much more complex  than just bank machines, giving you money. And people don’t generally  like being treated like machines, more than that, feel bored and refuse  to perform this money-giving function. Because people want emotions.  Amusement, pride, care, love, friendship, respect… you can continue the  list. This is it. This is why we get so much irritated when someone goes  directly to business – our desire to communicate, to share emotions is  not satisfied. We need to like a person with whom we want to do business  with. I had some fresh experience which was a good visualization for me of  the models of behaviour working and non-working. I recently participated  in one networking event. And was pleasantly amazed by the presentations  made by speakers. They were real fun, lots of jokes, smart  observations. The only exception was a speech of a woman, who took all  her time to speak about herself. It was undoubtedly a very exciting  topic for her, but evidently not to the audience. And though she took  all her time to make a sales speech, I don’t remember well, what it was  all about. Why? The answer is that simple: I didn’t listen to a speech I  felt I had no interest in, and so did most part of the audience. Conclusion – don’t sell yourself all the time, speak more about what  interests the audience, make fun and enjoy your time together, and then  you will be listened to and demanded. And who knows? There is a chance  to pass to a business conversation after trust and good attitude is  established. Nataly K., VP, Binary Studio", "date": "2015-04-01"},

It explains how to deploy and publish yours WPF application through ClickOnce technology. Also it helps to create auto-self updater. In this article I’d like to tell you about ClickOnce technology which helps to realize easy deploy, installation and update of the windows based client application such as WinForms and WPF. Application can be distributed to install and to receive updates in the forms of URL, URI and CD. In .NET 3.5 PS1 new possibilities were added, so now you can use not only IE for publishing your app in web. If you don't want to bother with all this, you can ask us to do a stunning applicaton for you - we provide professional .net software development services . If you just want some help and want to do all by yourself - here we go! So ClickOnce is a Microsoft technology for deploying Windows Forms or Windows Presentation Foundation-based software, also called Smart clients. It is similar to Java Web Start for the Java Platform. ClickOnce is only available in .NET 2.0 and later. A less advanced technique can be obtained with the Microsoft Updater Application Block. Let’s start! I created very simple WPF application which looks like: Now we have the application, we are ready to deploy it. We need to select the property of the StartUp Project and choose Publish tab. Here we see user-friendly and clear interface. I use “C:\\Publish” folder for deploying application in local folder in my computer (if you use server it will be “\\YourServer\\YourApp \\YourPublishDirectory” ). When we click to “Application Files” button we’ll see all files which will be included in deploy. Note: you can add any files to your assembly. For this you have to include this file to StartUp project, and then you need to change “Copy to Output Directory” to “Copy if newer” and “Build Action” to “Content”. I can’t find any way to add file from dependency assembly (if you find it -please tell me!). In “Prerequisites” button you can define products which should be included into your product. During installing your ClickOnce application check to see if those products are not installed and install them if needed. For me most interesting button is “Updates” where you can add self-auto update to your application. You can specify when app should check for updates, maybe time range for it. And of course please remember to include path for updates if it’s different. So I added update for this project. Then clicking “Options” button you can specify many different options such as publisher name, product name, support url and etc. Also interesting is “Deployment” tab: You can specify deployment web page for testing your application. And I suggest to choose “Use “*.deploy” file extension”. If your hosting deny any *.exe or *.msi files it’ll solve it. Also you can specify file extensions in your application. And in “Manifest” tab you’ll see: You can block your app from being activated from uri, allow parameters in uri, create desktop shortcut. If you add security certificate to your app, it’ll add information about your company. BTW: you’ll see it during installation instead of normal installator. And I selected “Exclude deployment provider URL” because I don’t know which server my app will be deployed in. So now we are ready to click “Publish Wizard” and few times next (or “Publish Now” and speci-fy installation folder Url too). After this I got following in my publish folder: You are ready to distribute your application! Let’s install it. Of course you’ll see your app in Start Menu and desktop shortcut. Let’s make small update. I only changed a background in my main window to “Aqua” and pub-lished it once more. We got new version (because we selected “automatically increment revision”). After publishing we have a new version in folder: Now I start my app from Start Menu and get: Yep, new version is available and I install it. And of course after this the label has background. If you deploy new version and you want to reinstall all copies of your app, you should specify a minimum revision version, like this: And now after starting my app all updates were installed without asking me! And if you want to uninstall it, you can’t restore previous version, only uninstall is available! Now a few words about ClickOnce, you can work with this technology in run-time. For this you should use ApplicationDeployment class from System.Deployment assembly. There are a few helpful properties: Then of course you can Check/Update and DownloadFileGroup new version (asynchonical version is available too). In this article we deployed and made self-auto update for our application by ClickOnce with MS Visual Studio 2008. BTW: you can make it without Visual Studio, using MS Build, Mage or MageUI utilities. Although it might seem as though you can only use Microsoft's ClickOnce installers with IIS, this is simply not true, as all you need to do is set some MIME types on the server. The simplest way to do this is to add the following lines to a .htaccess file in the folder contain-ing the ClickOnce files: Once you've done this, your ClickOnce applications should install correctly. You may also want to add the correct MIME types for XPS files, XAML files, XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs), and Silverlight applications. To add these, simply add the following lines: That’s all!

Recently we have developed a web application using very interesting and promising technology from Microsoft - Asp.Net MVC . For sake of an experiment we have decided to deploy it on the new Microsoft Azure Service Platform from Microsoft. And this experience I would like to share with you (If you're looking for azure development services check our page about our services). Both Asp.Net MVC and Azure products are pretty young, but attract close attention of programmer’s community. We have a positive experience with Asp.Net MVC, but this is a subject of another post, and I would like to concentrate on Azure. I should confess here that I did not figure out how exactly we can benefit from using Azure yet. In other words what are the specific requirements for the web application that make it adequate to be deployed using Azure. But already now I can tell you that when it comes to deployment Azure really makes life easy. So, let’s go step by step. Here is an official link for downloading page: http://www.microsoft.com/azure/sdk.mspx First of all we will need these packages: \"Windows Azure SDK\" and \"Windows Azure Tools\" for Microsoft Visual Studio. I did not download \"Microsoft SQL Data Services SDK\", but I surely will and you also may like to check it out. Important thing - system requirements. Supported Operating Systems: Windows Server 2008 Enterprise; Windows Server 2008 Standard; Windows Vista Business; Windows Vista Business 64-bit edition; Windows Vista Home Premium; Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit edition; Windows Vista Ultimate; Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit edition And this means that you simply can not install \"Windows Azure SDK\" on WindowsXP. If you also have this OS virtual machine is a good option. As soon as 2 packages are installed we can create a new project. You should use “Web Cloud Service” template. I will not guide you through creating a new cloud project, there is a bunch of good videos, please take a look at this link for example. Suppose you have created a cloud project, and there is a web site you want to put into this cloud. Please go to your projects folder (the one, ending with “_WebRole”) and delete all the auto generated files except of project files - those with “_WebRole” postfix ({YourSolution}_WebRole.csproj). Now you can copy your web site files into the folder and include them into the solution. Well, this is a subject for further investigation. I guess Microsoft will provide some SQL service for storing your sql data soon, but I have not figured out if it is already provided. Instead some articles say that for now you should use some third-party database hosting and use a corresponding connection string in your application. Or you can use some simple data storage instead, I did not have a close look to it, but you can try this link for more info. In our case we have simply used our internet provider’s database. 🙂 You can debug you web application just like you do for any asp.net application. Just don't forget to set your “_WebRole” project as a start project, because if you won’t then debug may never start. Well that is the sweetest thing - you right click you solution, press \"Publish\" and process is started. I will not repost deployment stages, but here is a link that will give more light: I will just say that in a couple of minutes your web site will be up and running. And finally I would like to say that Microsoft seems to bet high bids on Azure, so it definitely is worse your attention if you want to stay in stream.

You can let the application generate the documentation for you. How? Please read in the article. Do you write technical documentation for the project? No, because you still think this is a waste of time? As I faced repeatedly with a lack of technical documentation for the project or its poor quality, I decided to conduct some research. I assumed that: Our department writes in C# using Visual Studio 2005 / 2008 as a development environment that automatically enables us to adopt a ready means of documenting the rich code - XML Documentation. (I’d like to admit to be fair that there exist a lot of document generators - for different platforms and different programming languages, here is a comparative overview of some of them.) On the Internet, I came across an excellent article of Alan Dean \"C# Xml Documentation\" which detailed a process of adding xml documentation to the project, as well as a full review of existing standard xml tags with examples of their use. I have reviewed all of these tags, and roughly divided them into three categories: for mandatory, desirable use, and almost unnecessary. And I consciously strive to narrow the range of mandatory and desirable tags. I got the table like this: The toolbox has shrunk to 6 tags. And with those remaining need to adhere to the following important rule: «If you can avoid using the tag - do not use it!». Do not clog xml documentation with redundant information – it becomes unreadable, complicates the process of editing, which in turn increases the risk that documentation ceases to be valid. Once again: «If you can avoid using the tag - do not use it!». In addition, the private members of the class do not need comments at all. Often, the only tag used. In the vast majority of cases, this tag is enough to describe appointment of a class / method / field etc. A very important rule is that within the summary there should be written text only. No nested tags! The only exception is, perhaps, tag <para>. For example, the temptation is great to use inside of a tag <summary> tag <see>, because in the generated documentation tag <see> will be translated into a link. Don’t do this. First, because when you change the class name, link will cease to be valid and the compiler won’t tell you about this, and secondly, because the content of <summary> tag appears in the contextual help in Visual Studio editor and a full class name with all the namespaces will look messy. Wrong: Right: It is very important to try to withstand the commentary in the same style. All the methods I comment using pattern [step] [key features]: My pattern for the constructors is \"Initializes new instance of [...] using [...]: public MailManager(CultureInfo culture) Comments for the properties I start with keywords “Gets or sets”: It is always a pleasure, when the method warns you about what the exceptional situation it can provoke. It is a pity only that a programmer has to populate exceptions list manually - the compiler is not following the relevance of the list. Therefore, use <exception> tag with caution, because provided information may not correspond to reality. With this in mind, I use <exception> tag rarely, only when I am sure that the method will not change frequently. Use the tag <param> only when the parameters put forward any special requirements that are worth mentioning. In this example, 2 requirements being put forward - x and y must be nonnegative. Incidentally, in this example usage of tag <exception> is more then appropriate, right? This tag should be followed by <summary> tag. It is welcoming the use of nested tags <see> and <seealso> in the <remarks> tag. Moreover, if you do not use <see> and <seealso> tags inside <remarks> tag, than whole <remarks> tag is probably is not needed. These tags can only be used inside the tag <remarks>. As with the tag <exception> the compiler will not monitor the accuracy of your references, so use the tags <see> and <seealso> very carefully, and preferably do not use them at all. It is easy to follow a rule - immediately after the definition of some entity (class, method, etc) write a <summary> for it. Sometimes during the process of writing <summary> for a method, I come to the conclusion that this method is not needed. True - if I can not write a <summary> for a method, I do not understand its appointment. This is kind of an early application architecture diagnosing. I have described only a set of standard tags. But there are tools that can process additional set of commentary tags (xml is extensible). Following markup makes Sandcastle Help File Builder to insert into the resulting document code snippet from the file: <code lang=\"cs\" source=\"TestGizmo.cs\" region=\"GizmoClientSample\" /> By the way, MSDN was generated using Sandcastle. In general, writing documentation is like walking on blade’s age (sorry for the pathos) - on the one hand it is bad when documentation is poor, on the other hand it is bad when documentation process hardens application development process.

I am often asked about the differences and I believe this is the decisive factor for the success of a project. That’s why I decided to write this article, to share the ideas, vision and initiate a discussion. So, when it comes to outsourcing the IT part of your business, you basically have 2 options: either allow the company to do the whole project for some fixed price, or “hire” the IT guys, thus forming a remote development center and manage them as if they are employees of your company. Each model has its advantages and disadvantages, which I tried to cover in this article. Risks of the model: a) either ask for reestimation and set a higher price (I am told Indian companies do this trick quite often) or b) do the project according to the sum agreed. In the latter case company-executor bears all the risks, which results in: a) desire to minimize the risks, thus setting the highest price when doing the estimation or adding extra hours to feel safer; b) if a company extends the volume of works due to this or that reason, and stops getting profit out of the project, the motivation goes down. Risks of the model: As a result of my mini-investigation, it becomes clear that the dedicated team model is preferable in most cases for the following reasons: Do you agree?

First — simple client that integrates in menu and starts working after user performs proper action. It can communicate with user using dialog boxes and notification messages. Second is document report. It can be used for collecting and showing any additional information about selected document. For example FDK contains report sample that counts number of words in document. Third type is filter — special client for conversion one document type to another. You can add new file type support to the FrameMaker with it. And the last client type is take-control client. It starts working immediately after starting FrameMaker. It is useful for automatic document processing or remote controlling FrameMaker application. After open FDK guide you’ll find out that there are a lot of different “standard” C types implementations.

There are also a huge numbers of types that have no analogue in C language and can be very useful. For example working with hash tables and string lists can be done with instruments included in FDK without any additional code.

In this tutorial, you learn how to move your validation logic out of your controllers and into a separate layer. The goal of this post is to describe one method of performing validation in an ASP.NET MVC application ( asp.net mvc outsourcing ). In this post, I’ll show how to move validation logic out of controllers and into a separate service layer. Integrating validation and business logic is a key part of any application that works with data. For the beginning I would like to describe steps of building the validation. LINQ to SQL enables us to quickly create data model classes from existing database schema. To-do this we’ll open the database in the Server Explorer, and select the Tables we want to model in it. Imagine we have a LINQ to SQL data model, containing UserSettings and aspnet_User from the Simple_db database. As you may know, LINQ to SQL will generate these classes as partial classes, which we can use to extend this domain object’s behaviour We can then drag the tables onto the LINQ to SQL designer surface. When we do this LINQ to SQL will automatically create classes using the schema of the tables (with class properties that map to the database table columns). Visual Studio automatically generates .NET classes that represent the models and database relationships defined using the LINQ to SQL designer. A LINQ to SQL Data Context class is also generated for each LINQ to SQL designer file added to the solution. During the development of the controller action method, creating a corresponding view is very straightforward. To create a new view for the current controller action, right-click somewhere on the method body, and select Add view... from the context menu. The following dialog box will be displayed. In the Add view dialog box, some options can be specified. First of all, the view name can be modified if required. By default, this name will be the same as the action method name. It's also possible to select a view template, which we will set to Empty. This template can be used to easily create a view for example, one which shows the details of an employee. Within our UserSettings() action method we attempt to retrieve a UserSettings object using the id provided within the URL. If a valid UserSettings is found we call the View() helper method, indicating we want to use a “UserSettings” view template to render the retrieved UserSettings object. Now, because we already have Html.ValidationMessage() helpers in the view, our error messages will appear: The aim of this post was to discuss one approach to performing validation in an ASP.NET MVC application.

As you know, jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating and Ajax interactions for rapid web-development ( asp.net mvc software development ). Now jQuery is part of ASP.NET MVC. So we don’t have any barriers for using that technology in client side. In some of web-applications we develop we have to get much data from client. In one of our projects we had a table with mathematical formulas and parameters, which client can change. It looks like this: We decided to make it with jQuery. First of all we have to add jQuery library to our application. We put following code to the Sate.Master: The next thing we did was adding jQuery code to the page: Back on the server side of things, we're going to add a new action to the controller. In action result type should be JsonResult (in that way we get data from server in client side) and we should return our data in Data property of JsonResult object. So now we have jQuery behavior in our project. When client writes new data in any textbox, result formulas will change without postback (it is very good for a user).

The analysis is made, using data from Gartner's IT Outsourcing research. As we can see nowadays, nearshore and offshore software development is something that more and more software development companies are looking into. Leaving alone all the advantages and benefits of outsourcing (which, I am sure, you are quite well informed about), one important thing when thinking about outsourcing is selection of the best strategic partner for your business, which of course starts from selecting a proper offshore location. It’s time to start picking the “shore”, and like with grocery shopping it would be most logical to start with the nearest supermarket. My firm belief is that outsourcing from Western to Eastern Europe is the most reliable and effective option for now due to low risk and still pretty high price difference. Actually, if you need a creative and innovative team of developers (not just coders) for a reasonable cost, than Eastern Europe is the only right choice. Particularly, I am speaking about Ukraine. As you might know, Ukraine is situated in the heart of Europe and is the second largest European country. Being close to EU countries geographically, it is found in the same time zone (GMT +2), has similar mentality and very good education (as you remember, people of the former Soviet Union possess an extremely high level of technical and scientific expertise). Interesting fact: for the second year in a row (2007, 2008), Gartner’s research included Ukraine to the top 30 countries for Offshore IT Outsourcing. Gartner has assessed the suitability of 72 countries as offshore locations, and has announced its ‘Top 30’. Gartner used ten criteria that it determined important for organizations to consider when looking at a potential location for offshore or nearshore IT or business process services. They were: language, government support, labor pool, infrastructure, educational system, cost, political and economic environment, cultural compatibility, global and legal maturity, and data and intellectual property security and privacy. The fact that Ukraine was included to the top list once again speaks to the fact that it continues to attract its mature neighborhood such as EU and the Nordic regions as a high quality and low cost services provider. I can’t tell what shore is going to be the best for you, but one thing I am sure of – choose it wisely. The country selection needs to be taken exceptionally serious as it is one of the most important decisions you take in the vendor selection process. We are free to a point of choice, after that the choice controls the chooser. I will be glad to give you a specific advice and help you conclude about your offshore needs if you would be more specific. Contact me in Skype: shevchenko.anna_bs for further discussions.

Here are also some words about WPF MVVM ToolKit. At the end you’ll see creating simple WPF MVVM application with data bind. I think all of us have tried to write some application on WPF and were absolutely excited about that technology (by the way, our company Binary Studio is leader on wpf outsourcing market). It looks good on not very big business application. What about really big ones? I suppose, some patterns could help to create a really big application and have good test covering, since XAML things have become a bit complicated in trying to conceptualize MVC architectures for Windows applications. The gap between web and win is narrowing and the whole WPF thing adds diverse possibilities to one’s toolbox. What to use? Model-view-controler, the model-view-presenter or the new paradigm called model-view-viewmodel? In 2005, John Gossman, currently one of the WPF and Silverlight Architects at Microsoft, unveiled the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern on his blog. MVVM is identical to Fowler's Presentation Model, in that both patterns feature an abstraction of a View, which contains a View's state and behavior. Fowler introduced Presentation Model as a means of creating a UI platform-independent abstraction of a View, whereas Gossman introduced MVVM as a standardized way to leverage core features of WPF to simplify the creation of user interfaces. In Glenn Block's excellent article \" Prism: Patterns for Building Composite Applications with WPF \" in the September 2008 issue, he explains the Microsoft Composite Application Guidance for WPF. But what is MVVM, and why is it useful? The single most important aspect of WPF that makes MVVM a great pattern to use is the data binding infrastructure. By binding properties of a view to a ViewModel, you get loose coupling between the two and entirely remove the need for writing code in a ViewModel that directly updates a view. The data binding system also supports input validation, which provides a standardized way of transmitting validation errors to a view. Two other features of WPF that make this pattern so usable are data templates and the resource system. In addition to the WPF (and Silverlight 2) features that make MVVM a natural way to structure an application, the pattern is also popular because ViewModel classes are easy to unit test. When an application's interaction logic lives in a set of ViewModel classes, you can easily write code that tests it. In a sense, Views and unit tests are just two different types of ViewModel consumers. Having a suite of tests for an application's ViewModels provides free and fast regression testing, which helps reducing the cost of maintaining an application over time. As a result the development team can focus on creating robust ViewModel classes, and the design team can focus on making user-friendly Views. Connecting the output of both teams can involve little more than ensuring that the correct bindings exist in a view's XAML file. Also now using MVVM pattern is simpler because of WPF Model-View-ViewModel Toolkit 0.1 . It creates all you need for MVVM in WPF. Just now I’m creating simple application with MVVM. Here is an overview of what the application does. It takes your first name, last name and age and displays it to you in a message box. Below is a really complicated class diagram. Let’s take a look at the PersonModel class which is the only Model in the application: Person class implements the INotifyPropertyChanged interface which enables a WPF element to be immediately notified if any of the properties changed on a Person object. Let’s look at the View which is cleverly named, PersonView: The key take away from the XAML above is the way the PersonViewModel is attached to the PersonView’s DataContext. (This is the typical means by which the View gets a reference to the ViewModel). Also pay attention to the Button element, whose Command is using the Binding class to attach the SavePersonCommand, which is a property on the ViewModel. Here is the entire PersonViewModel class: WPF has a lot to offer for application developers, and learning to leverage that power requires a mindset shift. The Model-View-ViewModel pattern is a simple and effective set of guidelines for designing and implementing a WPF application. It allows you to create a strong separation between data, behavior, and presentation, making it easier to control the chaos that is software development. I’d like to recommend you only one reference about this technology and say thanks to John Gossman for his interesting blog about WPF. Artyom G., .NET team, Binary Studio", "date": "2015-04-01"},

First of all it is “close the window” (you are not allowed to access the window object in WPF MVVM). Second is how to link View and ViewModel. And last is how to make OnPropertyChanged method without string with name of property and add IntelliSense. So, let's start. First, if you don’t use MVVM pattern in your WPF development  yet, you definitely must install WPF Model-View-ViewModel Toolkit 0.1 . It creates all you need for MVVM in WPF. And you will love this. (By the way, we can help you in this. If you are looking for reliable wpf outsourcing services check the section about our core expertise). In this article I’d like to tell how you can take in some tricky things when creating WPF MVVM Application. First of all it is “close the window”. 🙂 Yep, it seems very simple but there is one thing: we are not allowed to access the window object. As a result almost each WPF forum has that question. A widespread answer is “you should write handler on code-behind”. Yes, of course you can but my opinion we should use just MVVM. As default MVVM template creates CloseCommand but it shuts down all application. So I suggest solving this task the following way. I created the new WPF Model-View application. After this I added to the ViewModelBase next command with event: Let’s create simple UI. I created a simple SecondView window and model for it. (there is CloseCommand - it’s object from ViewModelBase). On MainView I added just one button and binded it to a command which opens a second window (I will create it then). This is the main goal. I added the following handler to MainViewModel.cs: That’s all! Our second window can close and we don’t break MVVM pattern. It’s maybe second widespread question. Let’s assume we have model in MainViewModel.cs and we’d like to display its view. We should start by adding the following code to MainViewModel.cs from our previous application: Here I added such property as base class of ViewModel and two commands which will display simple user controls. At MainView.xaml: This ContentPresenter will display user control by binding. So after this I created two simple user controls (FirstControlView.xaml and SecondControl-View.xaml). They are very simple, so I didn’t add listening (you can see it in the source code). If you try to run this application now, you’ll get strange behavior! The reason is we should add DataTemplate to resources. So let’s add it to xaml. DataTemplate make links between your model and view for this model. There are links between first model and first user control and between second model and second user control. And now it works as we expect. And of course, it changes value (because we added OnPropertyChanged(\"Control\"); ) MVVM pattern is really good for creating our WPF application! And last thing in this article! As you saw we added: Yes, it works… but I absolutely hate this syntax!!! First, I have to write property name as string but I really prefer IntelliSense! And maybe a much stronger reason is that we are destined to make a mistake here (or forget change the new name) after big code refactoring. We won’t be able to catch these mistakes during the build and they will be very difficult to find and fix! Of course, we can add some method to ViewModelBase.cs which will check property name but it won’t fix first reason! 🙂 In this case it would be really nice to have a symbol-like construct in C#, preferably one checked for correctness by the compiler. Thanks Lambda Expression, in C# 3.0 it is easy to write a function that will return the string representation of a symbol. Now we can change ViewModelBase.cs like this: This is just beautiful. IntelliSense works too! And our code in MainViewModel.cs looks like: As you can see we reached all goals which we wanted to achieve: we have IntelliSense, if we change the property name we’ll have to change OnPropertyMethod too or we’ll get error during the build.

There might be various models, depending on the level and localization of project management for the concrete project. Project management is an important question in general and its importance increases when we start speaking about such sphere as software development outsourcing services. Outsourcing is a good thing, saving costs and giving access to high-skilled resources only in one case – provided it is properly organized. So, the main challenge in making successful the outsourcing development project is its proper organization. Below you will find some basic ideas about that. Generally the outsourcing is divided in fixed price and dedicated team models. Our main focus is setting an effective offshore/nearshore dedicated team , so I will leave fixed price model apart. When organizing a dedicated team, there might be also a number of options, which differ by the way the project is managed. Here belongs the model, when you provide all the project management of the team. That means, you treat these developers as your ordinary developers, as usual extension of your own team, you give them tasks, you supervise their progress, check their commits and motivate them in case they do things right, or criticize them in case they do something wrong. They use your project management system, bug-tracking system and usually there is a person they can address with questions on the client side. Or even you take time and let them get acquainted with the whole team, so they address the right person in case of necessity. This is possible but takes time to achieve. This model is effective in case you are ready to dedicate your time to manage things as if you have a team of guys depending on you in your offices. It works well, in case you have good project management traditions inside the company, organize projects in a smart way and are patient to explain things, especially at the beginning, when the guys just start getting acquainted with the project. The drawbacks – it still takes time and you need to dedicate at least 1 person at your premises to manage your dedicated software team . It is usually used in case you decide to outsource the full project. In such case a fully-functional team is created on the side of the Executor, with PM, team-lead and architect, you communicate to your team the project objectives and business specifications, and the team develops the projects from the design stage to the maintenance. The only thing needed from you is to check the demos and other intermediate results frequently in order to make sure the team is going in the right direction. It is easy to do with new projects, but require time to launch such cooperation with already existing ones, since the new team needs time to get acquainted with what is already present in the project. In this case a team with a certain hierarchy (PM, senior, intermediate, junior developers) is created. You should also take care to create a good communication channel between the responsible person on your part and the project manager on Executor’s part (remember, communication is IMPORTANT). So, when the team is gathered and the communication is set, you finally can relax and enjoy the advantages of outsourcing - you give your team big pieces of work and almost forget about the team for a while – it is the task of project manager to analyze the task, estimate it, make the planning, subdivide into tasks, make sure the team understood everything right (here PM might ask you some questions), give the tasks to developers and supervise the development and test the results. In this case you will have to spend a bit more time on the initial stage, when explaining the project in general and setting these big tasks carefully as well. Provided this first stage is a success, then further development is done practically without any involvement from your part. You will only look at the reports the PM will send you on a weekly basis (or less often if you want to) and check the intermediate or final results when they are available. As you can see, all three schemes have their advantages and disadvantages and are applicable with various types of projects. The main thing here is to establish good communication – once you’ve chosen a reliable software outsourcing company you feel comfortable doing business with, it will be easy to discuss project and agree on the way of cooperation that will suit both of you. Communication here, as in any other sphere, is the true key to success. Speak to each other, enjoy the process, feel delighted with the results and be successful!

You'll also find a couple of thoughts on application structure. Hello, inquisitive reader. Today you will go with me to the world of programming on the .Net platform, and specifically I would like to show you how the application may be implemented to access data (the way I do it lately). I program using C# language, and this stipulates considered below technologies, libraries and environment, such as: Microsoft Entity Framework, NUnit, ASP.Net MVC, etc. Experience, intuition and common sense dictate a set of rules, which I always try to follow during development, among them – one has to follow principles of DDD (domain-driven design). Regardless of what type of applications we have to do (website, desktop application, service), it is almost always true that behind the scenes we work with a database, and a set of classes which describe the subject area of application - we call them a model. Business logic deals with instances of model classes. As a link between database one hand and a model on another an ORM (object-relational mapping) system can be considered. Here, by following fashionable trends, my choice almost always falls on Microsoft Entity Framework. Bitter experience suggests that it is very undesirable to use classes, automatically generated via Entity Framework, for a model. The reason for this lies primarily in the very title of \"auto-generated classes\" - after changing the database structure, they will not avoid change themselves. The key to success is that meters should be developed without a regard to the database structure, and the link between the model and automatically generated ORM classes needs to be implemented on its own. My approach for this is writing an adapter class (I usually call it DataAdapter). I will refrain from comments and reservations about the completeness of the provided code, assuming that the reader has got some programming experience - in fact the class is written following an Adapter design pattern (see Design patterns) with all the consequences. The immediate fillings of an adapter are: And the best quality of code compliance is achieved via template method signatures, which will be discussed in detail below. The attempt to provide basic interfaces and abstract classes was not done yet, however it is clear that some repetitive patterns present in adapter’s structure. When I speak about code quality, I mean primarily two basic principles: Below goes a code samples with comments. For the easiness I call instances of automatically generated via ORM-system classes ORM-objects. Private helper methods. Convert ORM-object into the model object. Getting ORM-object from the database by an identifier. Converting an model object into the ORM-object, and adding it into the database. CRUD-methods. Obtain model object from repository by its identifier. The essence of the method is sequencive call of two private helper methods. Add a model object into the repository. Update model object in the repository. In the simplest case method looks like this: However, more interesting situation is when complex object is being updated and this entails updating / addition / deletion of his sub objects. Here private helper methods with their convenient signature come to assistance: The attentive reader must have noticed that while describing CRUD-methods I have used term \"repository\", in contrast to the description of private helper methods, where I have used term database. I won't explain the nuances of this moment, expecting sufficient knowledge in those reading these lines, paying attention only on the stated differences in notions. As you can see everything is pretty simple.

It overviews various facilities of Moq on concrete functionality samples and unit tests written with the help of this mocking framework. Explanation of “What is Moq” you can find here . I will just give it in short. Moq is mocking library for .NET. It takes full advantage of .NET 3.5 (i.e. Linq expression trees) and C# 3.0 features (i.e. lambda expressions) that make it the most productive, type-safe and refactoring-friendly mocking library available. And it supports mocking interfaces as well as classes. It is extremely simple and straightforward, and doesn't require any prior knowledge or experience with mocking concepts. In order to begin using Moq you will require moq.dll (you can download it from this indirect link). After you download it and reference to your testing project you can start using it. Quick start samples you can find here and I think they would provide you with more than enough information to begin testing. But from my side I want to give you few advices and deeper level samples which I got when tried to resolve various problems during development and testing. Anyway I should give some easy samples, so that my next article would be consistent. Let’s consider that we have next User model and manager interfaces (IUserManager and INotificationManager) which interact with such model. public class User { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string Area { get; set; } } public interface And UserService which serves some logic using both manager interfaces: I would strongly recommend use interfaces so this will make code more flexible and implementation independent but using mocking you may get deeper into internals of logic you test. This does not mean that Moq could not mock concrete class method. For such case you just need to make public method modifier virtual. Anyway testing of systems built with use of IoC/DI patterns and loose object coupling with Moq look and work very organically. Enough with talking and continue with testing. Let’s start with testing method of UserService: public User LoadAndPreset(string name, string newName, string area) { //searching by old name var user = _userManager As you can see we are searching for user by name and area and then updating name of found user to specified new value. So best (and one for this situation) candidate to be mocked is IUserManager.Find because in the real it would access to database or other storage where users are and it would be complicated and/or time consuming to execute/prepare in the test over real data access or so. Before start testing let’s initialize mock objects: [TestFixture] public class UserServiceTests { private Mock<IUserManager> _userManagerMock = new Mock<IUserManager>(); The following test checks correctness of service method execution: [Test] public void LoadAndPresetTest() { //this user object we wish method Find to return var user = new User() So what we defined with Moq? Actually we said that we would expect IUserManager.Find to be called with parameters “old value” and “area” and if method will be called with such parameters it should return object of type User defined by us. Note that parameters with which you call method should be equal to parameters you passed into method setup. Following sample shows such situation: var user1 = new User(); var user2 = new User(); _userManagerMock.Setup(m => m.Delete(user1)) .Returns(true); _service.Del Mocked method will not be called because user1 is not equal to user2 and by default mocking behavior (Mock.Behavior==Loose) mocked IUserManager.Delete will return false (which is actual default(T)). You may set Mock.Behavior to Strict if you want to be notified with exception about not set up method was called. But for the case of loose mock behavior we may check if our mocked method was called by Mock.VerifyAll (actually it will check for each setup) so if we put _userManagerMock.VerifyAll() after service method call we will get exception saying that not all setup methods called. For the cases when you cannot specify exactly same parameter value to method setup you may use one of: It.Is<T>(Expression<Predicate<T>>), It.IsAny<T>(T), It.IsRegex<T>(string), It.IsInRange<T>(T,T). _userManagerMock.Setup(m = And back again to loose coupling. Let’s look on next situation:", "date": "2015-04-01"},

How come software estimation is still hard today, despite a lot of accumulated experience in the field? Well, it turns out that while there are quite a few techniques to make a schedule more reliable, the principles at the core of the estimation process are still the same, and so are the difficulties. Accurate estimation, especially in today’s dynamic outsourcing world, is really not an easy task. Building a reasonable schedule or estimate is based on two complementary methods: analysis and analogy. Using analysis we divide a project into a number of more comprehensible subtasks which can be estimated easily, and then aggregate these estimates into the final one. For example, if we want to implement a microblogging service, we need to break down the functionality into the smallest possible blocks: user registration, login, sending posts, looking at the blog roll etc., and then weight up how long it would take to implement each one. Analogy is completely different style of thinking. Here we base the estimation on our previous experience: if we have done a similar project in the past and it amounted to x man-hours, then this project will take about the same resources. This is more informal method, but it’s suitable for quick and dirty estimation. Okay, so what’s wrong with those methods anyway? The problem with analysis is that it requires a very detailed realization of what exactly should be done. Planning in general words is fooling yourself – I’ve seen a lot of seemingly tiny details that completely changed my view on how to implement the project. Even if from a layman’s point of view tasks such as verifying that a program cannot fall into infinite loop, checking with 100% confidence whether user opened email or merely programmatically changing image on iPhone lock screen seem perfectly natural, in fact they are impossible due to fundamental, technological or political reasons. So to build a reliable estimate ideally one need to think over every little detail in the project. No wonder it can take a lot of time, but the real problem is sometimes we simply do not have enough information to make such an elaborate estimate. If piece by piece estimation is hard, then can’t we take a similar project figures as a reference? Well, every project is special. Even projects with the same domain can be very different inside (think twitter or plurk) – in fact, most of the time is often being spent not on the basic features, but on project-specific bells and whistles. That difference becomes drastic when comparing, for example, big social network with small online shop (though both are websites). Then, everyone’s experience is limited, especially having in mind rapid software industry progress. So you want to develop a large project with this hot year-old technology? Then it’s natural that we do not have very much experience with it, and hence you should not expect a very accurate estimate. So what to do if you don’t want to spend half a year on planning and a lot of money on a business analyst salary, but still want some time & budget estimate? Advice #1: Prepare a specification. You won’t believe how many clients are asking for an estimate after shedding three of four sentences about the project to be developed. Yes, nobody likes writing specs, but it would help a great deal during the development. By the way, you don’t need to be too picky, just describe what the app should do in a more detailed way. Advice #2: Don’t try to eat an elephant at once – long-term scheduling is always risky, make a prototype. We can settle on a 2-4 weeks prototype, after which you can see how the team works and the team can base their estimates on something real. It’s better to spend two weeks at the beginning than learn after year that it would take two more years to finish the project (by the way, Agile software development does not exist for nothing). And remember: even the best estimate isn’t perfect! Always take it with a grain of salt. P.S. Joel Spolky’s article on the estimation is quite good. I recommend reading it despite its “obsolete” marker – he’s using a new technique now, but the basic ideas are still very applicable.

We will review two approaches to build it (with prototypes and without). Also I will show how to build a class factory. So, let's get started 1. OOP building with “Prototypes” At first we need to have an object… Now we need to create a child to show inheritance. We will do it with property “prototype”. Now I will show how to implement inheritance where class is used instead of object: So methods, as we see, are stored in the prototype. In code below we will show how to implement polymorphism with prototypes: In code above we see that we call parent method “clickOnMe” from class prototype; Encapsulation: 2. OOP building without “Prototypes” The logic of work without prototypes is the same, but you will notice that initialization of methods is in constructor. So here is an example: Encapsulation without prototypes can be implemented in initialization of variables and methods inside constructor and if you want to make method or action public you need to set link of the current object for this method or property, example: Polymorphism without “Prototypes” can be implemented by overriding link for parent method from the child. Let’s take a look: 3. Class factory Now at the end let me show you how to create class factory in JavaScript: Inheritance and polymorphism in class factory: Summary: So OOP with prototypes: 1)   Works faster; 2)   Doesn’t take a lot of memory; 3)   Works with “instanceof” statement (tests if an object is of a particular type. It evaluates to true if the object is that type and false if it is not. Instance of is a reserved word and cannot be used for anything else but testing the object's type). Benefits of method without prototypes: 1)   Can create private members (properties and functions); My point of view is that the first method is better, because it works faster and looks more reliable as good code structure. But benefits of method without prototype are also important, for example if we don’t want to rely only on agreements for JavaScript (i.e. _protectedMethod). Benefits of class factory: Class factory is very similar on “OOP without prototypes” but looks much better and we don’t need to put additional word “new” when we create an object. i.e. button1 = Button(‘b’). And structure of code is much better. But general performance is less than in “OOP with prototypes”. Sergey K., .NET team, Binary Studio", "date": "2015-04-01"},

There are three JavaScript code compressors today: 1.       Microsoft AJAX Minifier ( http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com/ ) 2.       Google Closure Compiler (http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/) 3.       UglifyJS ( https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS ) Each of these compressors has its own futures. When you decide what compressor you will use you must read futures of each compressor. CDN Earlier I didn’t use CND (content delivery network) for my project. But now I think using CDN will make faster loading for users. For instance I will use jQuery library in my project and I can load this library from http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js . It can increase loading speed for user if user has already been in other site which used the same library. This library has already been loaded to user’s cache and when user will come to our page his browser just get this library from cache and won’t load it from our server. documentFragment When you have to add big piece of code in DOM then you’d better use documentFragment object.c The example above creates a document fragment, adds some HTML to it, then appends the entire sub-tree to the <body> of the main document. The DocumentFragment interface inherits from Node, and is a lightweight version of the Document interface, intended for temporary storage of DOM structures. For example, it can be used as temporary canvas for building a group of nodes or to store a group of nodes while moving it from one part of a document to another.

This event is particularly important for startups and we are going to represent FLP.UA which was developed here, at Binary Studio. The core of the event is competition held between 150 startups and we are going to set FLP.UA forth. Let’s be more precise about the event. IDCEE 2011 consisted of four parts. During the conference the selected start-ups from the CEE region did not only pitch their projects to investors, but also participated in the start-up competition. Apart from that the conference was dedicated to keynote speeches by the outstanding experts and visionaries, as well as to panel discussions on hot topics. Investors and entrepreneurs had the opportunity to discuss the projects one-on-one. The most successful start-ups shared the financial consideration of the conference. Our aim was to represent FLP.UA project to investors and potential customers as well as establish relationships with them. To give the general understanding of the application we developed, it’s important to know that FLP.UA is aimed at decreasing everyday efforts, spent at dealing with all the documentation and tax reports of an ordinary entrepreneur.  FLP - is a productivity tool designed to help you manage financial information more easily. This software helps in accounting, bookkeeping and managing your income and expenses. These software solutions are used to monitor expenses, create invoices and tax reports, etc. To use FLP.UA you don’t need any specific knowledge. Therefore the system spares time, budget and nerves. It allows the entrepreneur to check in the data to his account as well as to analyze his activity from any corner of the world. Thanks to our partner – Microsoft and Windows Azure hosting, all the users’ data is surely protected and available anytime. Designed as SaaS application, FLP.UA was developed using such Microsoft tools as: MS Azure, ASP.NET MVC, MS Silverlight, Ms SQL Server as well as Java Script, jQuery, Ajax etc. To cut the long story short, we loved the event! There were so many positive start-up examples, a huge number of inspiring speakers and overall atmosphere!  It’s worth noting that we did arrange 4 meetings for FLP.UA and are sure we will benefit from new acquaintances we established at IDCEE.", "date": "2015-04-01"},

It was the basis of jQuery earlier but now this is a separate project that has no dependencies. Minified version of Sizzle is very small (about 4 KB) so it can be easily embedded into another library or be used when all jQuery functionality is not needed. There are only few ways to find element in HTML DOM. All high-level selectors invoke one of getElement methods in the end that allows finding element by its name, tag name, identifier or class name. That’s why selector expression should be as specific as possible. Use of identifiers makes selection task much easier while selecting from a log of elements with the same class leads to complete enumeration. There are some tricks that take into account performance of the specific browser versions but in common case such optimizations are controversial. Important fact about Sizzle engine is that the search result is never cached. CSS hooks provide a way to define functions for getting and settings CSS properties. They can be used for normalizing features and such as border radius, box shadow or gradient. Common property will be automatically transformed into browser-specific if it is necessary. In the worst case property will not be applied. There is a plugin named jquery-cssHooks that includes predefined collection of common CSS hooks. As well as many other frameworks in different languages, jQuery allows to associate arbitrary data with HTML element. The data method gets or stores value by key. Value can be simple string, object or even function. jQuery stores associated data in its cache. That’s why other library functions are aware about data and can decrease memory leaks after DOM change. Custom HTML 5 data-attribute value acts as initial data value and will be automatically converted into JavaScript object (unlike attr method that always returns a string). Complex object is described in JSON standard in curly brackets. jQuery plugin declaration is a common way for extensibility and code separation. Plugin method becomes available for any element object and element context is passed to plugin code. It allows applying plugin method to set of DOM elements. One more approach in separation of server- and client-side development is using Fixture plugin. Often client and server code is written by different team members. Code that contains AJAX requests cannot be tested while server code is in development. Fixtures operate like fake objects. They catch requests and return fake results after delay. Fixtures support predefined results, regular expression, echo and so on. Real requests are not performed. Important thing is that no code changes are required. There are a lot of methods for interacting with DOM: inserting and removing elements. They are very straightforward and don’t require any explanation. There’re two sets of methods for different directions, for example, append and appendTo, insertAfter and after, replaceAll and replaceWith. These pairs are equivalent except placement of the content and target. Convenient wrap function wraps HTML snippet around each element in the set. In some cases forced context should be set. Proxy method creates wrapper for any function and this wrapper always has specified context.

New ideas, new projects, new contacts… In Donetsk, spring is also the time for students to think about their future as their graduation time comes closer. Well, there’s a good opportunity – Binary Studio’s Academy is opening again! Last year’s learning season provided us with quite satisfying results. The developers which worked as Academy’s tutors have achieved some good experience, while our company got a number of new skilled professionals. But what was the most valuable for us – we saw that efficient knowledge sharing is possible! Academy’s success meant that Binary Studio is not just another outsourcing services provider but also a place where new software development professionals are forged. This time we decided to go further. An intense advertisement campaign is launched using several social networks (most popular in Donetsk). We also cooperate with biggest Donetsk universities and institutes. This week several open tests will be held in order to pick out most talented IT students and graduates. Finally, we are planning to make some improvements in the learning process: more practice, more individual tasks, personal tutorship for all students, etc. Stay tuned! We are going to share with you all the Academy’s news and updates. Reports about the test results will follow shortly.", "date": "2015-04-01"},

Today IT industry continues growing fast, and modern software maker corporations really match enterprises of other industries. So outsourcing is popular in that sphere. A big software development project run by a company usually includes some non-core tasks that are passed to offshore or onshore software development groups, which do not belong to the company’s staff. Practical reasons for outsourcing are quite simple: saving cost and saving time. Most development companies prefer not to employ new people for fulfilling a project because some extra time should be spent for their training and making them a team. A group of skilled professional software makers from aside is a much better choice for doing such a project as they have already enough experience in the field of custom software development and will solve their organizational problems by themselves. In this case the company does not have to spend on maintenance, social programs, medical insurance, project management, etc. So no wonder that the last financial crisis resulted in further growth of IT outsourcing market. While outsourcing programming teams exist all over the globe, we can see a certain distribution of demand by geographical regions. Usually economically developed countries have the highest interest in inviting software outsourcing teams. The biggest concentration of significant IT projects is located in those countries, where post-industrial trends are most strong. So let us investigate how much long-term custom outsourcers are likely to be paid in such regions as: USA, Canada, Western Europe. USA is the world leader in software development, being the birthplace of computer science and Web-technologies. Major American software project teams are also the greatest IT corporations on the planet, like Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle, Borland and others. So the country’s need for outsourcing is strong. Average annual salary for custom software development and support in the country is about $85,000. In Canada software companies operate with lesser funds as the basic level of prices is lower than in USA. The average annual salary for outsourced IT services in the country is about $65,000. Among Western European countries UK is one of the most competitive by the dimensions of IT market. In 2010 the net revenues for software development outsourcing are about 8 billion pounds. The average proposed salary for software staff is above $50,200 per year. In France the outsourcing market was growing by about 5% annually during the last years. In 2010 the growth proceeded despite the skepticism of analysts. Currently the average yearly salary for full time software developers is about $49,000. The DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) being a high-tech leader on the continent has a developed and rapidly growing IT industry. This year the size of IT outsourcing market in the region is about 17 billion euros. The average proposed salary for software engineers is up to $56,000 per annum. Netherlands has a developed IT industry with outsourcing being its only sector to have positive growth (about 2.2%) in 2010. Currently, average annual salary for full-time staff proposed by Dutch software producers reaches $64,800. Salaries for software developer jobs in Australia/NZ and Finland were added to this comparative chart in order to better illustrate the current situation in the IT markets of North America and Western Europe. In certain cases salaries in IT outsourcing may deeply vary, as they are based upon the required quality level of the project and on outsourcers’ experience. The physical location of an outsourcer is important too – software developer companies when adopting the offshore outsourcing may choose teams from India, China, Philippines, where prices are much lower. On the other hand, many project managers prefer the onshore outsourcing in order to increase the quality level and avoid language barriers. In this situation many prefer to hire outsourcing teams from Eastern Europe, mostly from the former Soviet territory, where the formidable level of engineering is preserved and prices are quite low comparatively to other European countries.

Such situation is typical for every period of development of different industries and economic zones. Some regions specialize in producing values, while others build their economy upon the consuming. Thus, the rise of software development industry and the globalization of offshore and nearshore outsourcing caused the appearance of specialized regions all over the globe. In the previous article we analyzed the developed countries including USA, Canada, Northern and Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, which having a formidable level of hi-tech concentration at home belong to the global zone of demand for the software development labour. Actually software outsourcing teams exist everywhere, but a certain concentration of them in some regions of the world was caused by local social and economic peculiarities. Such states as India, China, Philippines and Malaysia are well-known leaders in low-level software development. Their resident companies perform vast amounts of programming job cooperating with North American and Western European enterprises willing to outsource parts of their software development projects. The reasons for that high level of outsourcing proposal are overpopulation and poor local social standards which result in very low prices compared to average rates within the “demand zone”. Another notable region of IT software outsourcing proposal is the Eastern Europe which consists mostly of ex-members of the Soviet control zone with developing economies. Such countries as Poland, Romania, Czechia, Slovakia, Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus contain significant number of IT software professionals and currently have strong economic ties with Western European countries. Besides, a formidable level of technical science in the late USSR resulted in a good qualification level of today’s IT software developers which due to serious economic decrease in many East European countries in the 1990s became interested in cooperation with Western companies. Finally, East European software outsourcers possess such bonuses as minor language barriers and location within a few time zones from Germany, UK, or France. Similar nearshore outsourcing region working mostly to satisfy needs of North American software development enterprises includes a number of Central and South American developing countries. Mexico and Costa Rica provide serious amount of outsourcing development proposal due to their close neighboring with the USA. Another big outsourcing center is in Brazil, which possesses great human resources and took many efforts in raising its technical level during the last decades. Chile and Argentina also belong to the “proposal zone” of the region, having a bonus of comparatively stable economic conditions. During the last years African countries also began to grow their software development resources. States in the North of the continent make use of their close borders and strong economic relations with European “demand zone”. For example, Egypt and Southern Africa became greatly involved into IT outsourcing during the last years. Several other African countries recently appeared on the market too. Below is a chart reflecting shares of different regions in the world software outsourcing market, based on the rating of the world’s top outsourcing cities and regions where they are located. As we can see, the share of the “demand zone” is about 13 per cent only. As noted before, the primary reason for outsourcing IT software projects is cost reduction. A software development team from a country within the “proposal zone” can have two or three times lower rates compared to an average programmer’s fee in a “demand” region. In different countries those rates vary depending on many factors: economic situation, closeness to bidder, attractiveness for business, number of competing outsourcers etc. Below is a chart showing average hourly fees for outsourced development projects in companies from Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia. As we can see from the picture, fees are higher in Eastern Europe. This is mostly due to the quality of local software outsourcers’ work. Besides, this region possesses some bonuses which make it attractive for project managers from the European “demand zone”. They are: geographical proximity, neighboring time zones, very low cultural and linguistic barriers. We can also notice that in Ukraine fees are lower than the average value, so Ukrainian software outsourcers could be a best choice for your project.

Today the software development industry deals with fast changing situation in the market. So, the objectives may change during the project fulfillment. The success strongly depends on how much of precious time was spent on discussing the changes in the working schedule. That’s why a team of developers must be able to switch easily between local tasks and receive feedback from customers in real time. The more interaction is needed, the more important is the question of a region where the outsourcing team is resided. If the timezones are close to each other, that would be most convenient for real-time knowledge exchange. So, it is better to choose a nearshore place where good knowledge of English is widespread. By all means, the Eastern Europe is the best fit. Being located in a prominent Ukrainian industrial center, we enjoy having a strong basis of educated IT specialists here. Since 2005, Binary Studio is present on the IT outsourcing market , successfully working with clients from different European countries.

The success of a project is based upon three things: its price, the quality of the work, and its speed. So, the work is to be cheap, fast, and well done. The maximization of all these issues leads to success. Outsourcing is considered today to be the best way to optimize the time and cost. Passing some part of the work to outsourcers will save your time, while their comparatively low prices are seriously reducing the overall budget. So, the question is about quality. When you choose to outsource your project, you have to make sure those guys abroad shall do the work no worse than you would by yourself. It is simpler to hire a team that you have already worked with, so that you know about its strong and weak points. But how to find a new and really good outsourcing company with guaranteed quality of work? The first thing that you will become aware about an outsourcing company is its experience. Surely, the best choice would make a company recommended by some respected project owners. You can evaluate the quality of the team’s work by analyzing the list of successfully fulfilled project it can announce – in case there is such a list. Our company is present on the software outsourcing market since 2005, and by this day we have obtained a notable experience of working with various projects.

So we decided to have a charity event, which actually filled our hearts not only with sympathy but also with the goodness we lacked. Charity is not a thing you do just because you have to, it’s your inner wish to help those who suffer in vain. Just because they weren’t as lucky as you. Just because they didn’t have so much as you. Just because their way to normal life is much more harder than yours. We have recently been to children’s home. Emotions are overwhelming. In the beginning it was pretty difficult to choose where we should go. I didn’t even imagine there were so many orphanages and homeless children respectively. As it was our first time, we chose a small children’s home with about 50 inmates aged till 6 years. Our idea was to give children things they really needed not just some toys or money. Therefore we called and got to know that they simply lack groceries. According to the standards each child should get 30 gr. of grouts daily. That’s just 2 spoonfuls. Being kind in their hearts and wishing to grow healthy children, administration exceeds these merciless quotes. Therefore they asked us to bring potatoes, grouts, vegetables and some health and beauty aids. They didn’t ask us for anything excessive. They asked us for food which would help their foster-children grow healthy. How can you think of closing your eyes to such issues? Administration of the orphanage was extremely grateful for everything we brought. Having unloaded our gifts, we were let play with the kids. That was the best part of the whole event. For about hour and a half we enjoyed this warm, ingenious and outmost pleasant communication. The children appeared to be very open, talkative and kind. The atmosphere was really nice but a bit crazy, some of them were running all the time, the others laughing and throwing balls or whatever. We didn’t even have to think any games out or look for a way to meet them and get to know their names. They did everything themselves - came, asked for your name, sat on your lap or just started playing with you. Most of us don’t have any children yet, that’s why we feared a little to start this communication. Though, it on the contrary appeared to be very simple and natural. We even lost the track of the time and when the tutors told us it was time for children to go and have their lunch we were astonished – almost 2 hours have passed. When we left they got upset, so did we. But we did feel we did something good. That is the reason why we are trying to motivate other IT companies to take part in such events and help homeless children. Just because it’s not their fault. Just because they deserve a little warmth. Binary Studio is planning to start a small non-commercial project IT 4KIDS. The purpose is to gather IT developers and companies who care and organize regular children’s homes visits.", "date": "2015-04-01"},

Such location provides serious advantages in the means of outsourcing: Nowadays most managers who consider outsourcing their projects prefer neashoring. For example, according to some statistic researches , more than 50% of US companies choose or are going to choose Latin America countries as an outsourcing destination. For European companies, the countries of Eastern Europe are an attractive neashore zone. What speaks for such a choice? Though outsourcing means remote cooperation, some amount of close contact is always necessary. Typically, a project manager visits the outsourcing team once every several months in order to see how the things are going and to share views and ideas. Knowledge exchange between project members critically depends on how well they understand each other. Speaking a common language is quite important, but close mentality is also very helpful. Therefore, residents of close cultural regions cooperate easier. Being a key element of industrial and transport system of Ukraine, Donetsk (by the way, sister city of Bochum, Germany ) is closely connected with main European countries. So, cultural barriers for outsourcing here are close to none! Michael T., technical analyst", "date": "2015-04-01"},

To begin with, people have to speak a common language in all senses. It must be ensured that no misunderstandings will take place as well as no important info will get blocked. So, a well-built software outsourcing team should not only master customer’s language of the client (actually English is enough for most cases), but also have strong tides inside, among teammates. Teambuilding is quite important in outsourcing. Our company puts special emphasis on issues related to group work. We consider team interaction and workers’ ability for self organizing as key elements of development and testing. In our opinion, not constant supervision, but rather everyday communication is needed for a good teamwork. Besides, we are positive about the importance of information exchange between customer and the team, so in our opinion it should be as rich as possible.. Our developers usually spend from 20 to 25 per cent of their working time for discussions with clients, as all the important changes and questions are immediately shared with the other side. We feel obliged to let customer be aware of all the details of our project planning. Everyone wants to be listened to and heard. Weak informational connection with an outsourcer can be a really irritating thing. In software development some issues and mistakes may occur pretty often, so of course project managers worry when gets no or too little feedback from a team. In our case being transparent and ready for dialogue is a matter of principle. All our software professionals are skilled in English and possess profound knowledge of English terminology in fields of their work.

{"website": "Binary_Studio", "title": "doctrine-migration", "author": ["Binary Studio"], "link": "https://binary-studio.com/2011/07/07/doctrine-migration/", "abstract": "A team of developers pretty often bumps into a problem when they need to save database history and update it during the development process without loss of existing data. A lot of people create a history file, which they keep in the repository and each developer during the work process saves there commands of file updates. However this way is inconvenient for work in a big team, because members of the team get to know it’s high time they updated their copy of the base when the system has already returned an error. Most of ORM libraries currently support migration mechanism. The article gives a brief overview of migration by means of Doctrine Library connected with Symphony framework. Doctrine consists of a class set usable for migration creation. Migration class is a child of Doctrine Migration Base class, which includes a set of methods for database tables structure updates. Doctrine allows generating migration classes automatically for its following use during the database structure update. Moreover developer has an opportunity either to migrate to a certain version or to roll back the tables structure updates. Let’s try to illustrate migration mechanism by means of example. There’s a project where configuration file is already defined, it keeps database tables structure and the models have already been generated. After a time some changes have to be made to the existing tables as well as new ones have to be created. A developer changes file schema.yml, changes tables’ configuration and adds new ones. Next instead of starting a command, which would create classes of our models we first of all generate migration classes. php symfony doctrine:generate-migrations-diff – Doctrine will compare our models structure (the ones we have not updated yet) with the updated file schema.yml, define differences and create classes, which will contain methods for creation of new fields and tables or for index updates. Afterwards we will be able to find migration classes in the directory lib/migration/doctrine. Every new migration class has its own index. When you use migration mechanism for the first time, table called migration_version will be automatically created in the base. The table will keep version of database. Now we can apply migration files and refresh our database. php symfony doctrine:migrate [version]. Option “version” is migration number; we do not have to point out this option if we want to apply all database updates. Later on we can create our models, forms and filters again. php symfony doctrine:build-model php symfony doctrine:build-form php symfony doctrine:build-filter We can add migration classes to repository, so when other developers update their projects copies, they will get these classes and it will be enough for them to perform a command php symfony doctrine: migrate , in order to renew their copies of databases. One should remember that migrations not always update data; there is also a risk to lose data during such a database update. I personally faced a problem of such kind,- I renamed a field in a table. Created migration classes, deleted existing field and created a new one with the new name instead, this way I could have lost all the data, kept in this field. That is why, the best way is to check the code of migration classes you generated and understand what they do before you use them.

The same amount of money allows buying far more things in Ukraine, than in USA. Traditionally, people who live in a certain country work and spend their money inside it, getting accustomed to the local prices level. But now we have got the Internet, so a person using some skills can work remotely ‘in a galaxy far, far away’. In business, it is crucial to reduce costs for creating products. With modern communication technologies connecting people in remote corners of the planet, outsourcing is a traditional way to solve this problem, especially in software development industry. Today more and more people throughout the world become interested in computer science. As a result, in developing countries there are plenty of skilled programmers whose rates are comparatively low. Software outsourcing is widespread around the world. But there are countries where outsourcers’ rates are higher and lower. In one of our previous posts we did a small research about countries where software projects from EU and USA are usually outsourced, and average price levels in such places. It also was found that nearshore outsourcing, when neighboring countries are preferred, grows more popular today. US project managers often look for collaborators in Latin American countries, while many European projects are outsourced to the Eastern Europe. Aside of linguistic and cultural proximity, nearshore outsourcing has another advantage such as good transport connection. For example, it’s rather cheap and takes not much time for a PM from Netherlands to get to Donetsk in order to interact with the team he outsources his project to in person. Therefore, he can make such visits more often, if needed. As an outsourcing company with significant experience in collaborating with European and US software producers, Binary Studio is always open for any suggestions and offers its customers flexible price system. If you want to get more details about it, please feel free to fill this form , and a special payment program shall be created for your project. We are much concerned about long-term partnership, so it is very important for us that our clients find it convenient to work with our company. We are glad to propose you various discounts to help you cutting down your expenses, because we are sure that both sides will finally benefit!", "date": "2015-04-01"},

Well, this strong demand must be met with strong proposal! Binary Studio, a leading outsourcing services provider in Donetsk, Ukraine, is ready to offer its services. Web application development is a cornerstone business activity since 2005. Judging by their history, web apps will evidently be even more popular in the future. While networking technologies appeared quite a long time ago, the Web itself was not widely regarded as a viable environment for business solutions and business performance until the last decade of the century. In order to turn a number of global computer networks into a new, virtual world the crucial step of browser implementation was needed. When Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML in 1990, we began to see familiar websites, then the support of multimedia content and finally with the ability to embed applications into websites. Technically, it allowed bigger diversity of data formats to be used, but, in general, brand new markets were discovered, with seemingly endless demand potential for new goods and services. Since the introduction of the Internet to the masses all over the world in the early 1990’s, a real demand for web applications appeared. And the virtual world desperately needed resources (good content) and infrastructure (technologies to work with it). Each year more and more users, including businesses, governments, households, and associations, realized they needed to be represented on the Internet. And so the web development industry began to thrive. Since the early 1990’s, the Internet has grown through numerous changes. And now today it plays an irreplaceable role in our daily lives. Today the average person in a big city, in a developed country, spends a significant amount of time online every day. In 2010 Pew and Nielsen reported that about 55% of Americans use Internet every day. From this we can expect an even higher percentage in the largest cities such as New York, San Francisco, as well as for large capital cities worldwide. With this, the age demographics of the world’s Internet user base also changed significantly during the 2010’s. Surveys show that people between 45 and 54 years tend to be one of the major Internet user groups. Evidently, the massive growth of online business is one of the main reasons of this effect. Actually, corporate users create demand in the web applications market. From the technical side web applications divide into three main groups: Thin Client applications run through browsers where scripts are executed. Most of the data is processed on remote servers with minimal usage of a client’s computer. Connection with servers is performed through the HTTP protocol. Thin Client applications are usually based upon open standards and require no software downloads. The following technologies belong to this group: XHTML, JavaScript, DHTML, and AJAX. RIAs require some installation and enable more advanced data exchange between clients, including multimedia content, real time validation, remote messaging, etc. They are processed on local computers and require certain plug-ins to be installed in the browsers they run in. This group includes Flash, Active X, Java Applets. Rich Client applications do not use browsers; they can function offline. They integrate with local hardware and software, utilizing local data processing in order to optimize rich interactions between clients. Their main task is connecting to remote distributed data sources, and to update centers. Java Web Start, and Windows Smart Clients are common examples of such technologies. The introduction of advanced web technologies provided a large set of vital opportunities for clients. The abilities to exchange multimedia content in real time, capture and process lots of data from remote sources, and to establish secure connections for sending financial and business data made the Internet even more attractive for corporations. On the other hand, the increasing use of enhanced open source tools such as PHP, resulted in a significant increase for business in the web development market. The following types of web-based solutions are most popular today: The industry’s evolution is also influenced by the geographic division of labor. USA, a leading pioneer in networking technologies, naturally produces most ideas and trends for modern web development industry, with Western Europe being its closest rival. As for the practical implementation, it’s being done all over the world. Web application projects (as well as custom software development projects) are widely outsourced to China, India, as well as to Eastern Europe which is especially popular for English speaking countries, and Western Europe corporations as a nearshore outsourcing zone. Outsourcing is going to thrive as long as living standards vary in different regions. Given that a developer’s salary at home was somewhere about 60,000 USD in 2010 and for an offshore programmer it should be less than 45,000 USD, it is no wonder that employers from North America, Western Europe and ANZ region were anxious about outsourcing their projects and remain so today. During the 2010s Web applications are likely to overgrow the traditional software solutions in importance as more and more providers migrate to the Cloud. Virtual clusters of servers, sharing their computing resources and memory, have many advantages due to their dynamic structure.  For example, there is no need to put all servers in the same building, so the problems of data backup and crash resistance are easier to solve. Besides, it is quite unlikely for several computers in remote locations to shut down at the same time. Finally, any number of new machines could be added to a dynamic cluster any time. The amount of outsourcing in the web development (as well as custom software development ) industry will quite possibly grow. While earlier India and China dominated in this sector, now some other regions begin gaining importance. One of these places is Eastern Europe, which already serves as a convenient nearshore outsourcing zone for such countries as Germany, France, Netherlands etc. Eastern Europe countries, especially post-Soviet countries with their high level of science and technology education, and industrial development, provide the best quality/price ratio. These former Soviet Union countries benefit from the high level of technical skills and strong education systems. This, and the lower cost of living, brings relatively lower costs and developer fees. And the Western world enjoys relationships with companies in Eastern Europe because of a culture and mentality much closer to the Western world, and because the English language is widespread among the developers. So the growing demand of services in the web development market is going to be met by an increasing business market. And that means further success for industry. Binary Studio has great experience with web application development, having successfully accomplished a number of projects, for many years. We have produced all the types of web-based solutions listed above. Binary Studio is ready to help when you’re interested in offshore web app developers.

Today there are lots of outsourcing companies in different regions, so you always have several variants to choose from. Some of them may propose quite low prices, but cutting the cost is not the only thing that is needed. Good quality and reasonable time are also necessary. When evaluating the qualities of an offshore team of developers, an employer must take into account all the aspects of their performance, note their weak and strong sides and finally decide whether this team meets the special requirements for his project. Of course, different projects have different key requirements and it would be hard to develop some kind of a universal guide covering all the possible criteria. Still, it is helpful to investigate how the work of such an offshore team is technically organized – that is, how do they manage the software development process. 1. Teamwork Big project needs a number of people to fulfill it, that’s why you may need to hire a team. Besides, people usually perform much better when uniting their efforts – ideas and solutions are optimized through discussions, problems and stopping issues are brainstormed and so on. Of course, a good organization is needed for achieving such a synergic effect. Various styles of team management exist, still at the moment it is most popular to use Agile methods in programming process organization. Less centralization and richer knowledge sharing – these principles are favored by more and more developers all over the world. Decentralized and more informal atmosphere proves to be helpful for working out a more creative approach to tasks and problems. Still, some hierarchy is always present as it facilitates the roles distribution inside a team. 2. Working Remote Remote working is actually a great option for a custom software professional. Modern telecommunication technologies allow doing the all the job online and interacting with other people via email or video calls. Advantages of hiring contributors working online are well-known: no need to arrange working places and proper conditions, no expenses for transportation etc. However, some negative factors are always present. Of course, all the useful information can be easily shared in real-time via the Internet. During the software development process, certain tasks still may require face-to-face interaction. Besides, the supervising is not so easy to perform online. This is one of the most important things, which make difference between hiring freelancers and using the services of outsourcer teams. 3. Outsourcing Software outsourcing companies which participate in big custom software development projects are usually keen about the teambuilding. Hiring a ready, well-built developer team is surely better than seeking freelancers for all the tasks in your project. In such a case you gain in quality as you don’t have to bring all the freelance contributors together and make them cooperate (which is not quite simple for people residing in different locations or even in different time zones). Besides, you will minimize risks because the working schedule of a remote team will be guaranteed by the outsourcing company. The main reason for outsourcing your project is to reduce its cost while keeping its quality. So the best choice is a software outsourcing company really concerned about highly effective teamwork. It thus essential to target the outsourcing firms which support serious research and development work for their inner optimization. 1. Raising performance effectiveness What is most needed for achieving better quality inside a reasonable time period? Obviously, less errors and less unnecessary efforts. Such things as thorough planning and creative approach to complex tasks are very helpful for raising the efficiency of a team performance. In order to raise the efficiency of the overall software development process, outsourcing company should pay much attention to team building methods. Supporting strong ties between the members of the working group will help to make more use of their skills. This includes rich information sharing inside the team, as well as between the team and the customer side. 2. Raising interaction effectiveness One of the best ways to make information exchange more efficient is to remove all the discouraging issues by making the office atmosphere friendlier and less formal. Today it is regarded as a proven fact that employees, who are able to plan their daily schedules themselves and don’t have too much supervising, interact with each other freer. This is especially effective when brainstorming difficult tasks. Successful IT outsourcing services companies tend to encourage developers to exchange their experience with their colleagues during team meetings, to attend professional conferences etc. When seeking a value-added offshore (or nearshore) contributor for a custom software development project, project managers are always closely examining outsourcer companies’ experience. It is also good to investigate their methods of teambuilding and management if possible. A good software outsourcing company should not only suggest a developer team to its potential customer, but also let him participate in its creation, in discussing the positions and in settling the working schedule for the team. Such policy ensures that customer’s needs would be satisfied in a best way. Binary Studio, a leading software outsourcing company in Ukraine, has a notable experience with custom software development projects. We are using most advanced techniques of team building and project management and are also supporting a high level of professional interaction inside our staff. Our methods include: Regular teamwork in our company includes intensive interaction with the customer side. All our project managers have fluent English which allows them to interact freely with clients from any country. Binary Studio uses many techniques of team members training and motivation.

That means more work for software development companies and, particularly, for offshore IT outsourcing services providers. While in the middle of the previous decade India and China were undisputable leaders of the world outsourcing markets (including such niches as web software development services, custom software development services, animation and game development services), now some new challengers have come forward. During the last several years Central and Eastern Europe (a.k.a the CEE region) became quite attractive for IT offshoring. The CEE countries have mostly much lower prices and average developer fees than their neighbors from Western and Northern Europe. Geographic proximity and strong economic ties also matter. All that makes project owners from Germany or UK quite interested in finding nearshore contributors in such country as Ukraine. Also, North American companies more often consider outsourcing their IT projects to Eastern Europe, preferring cost-effective developer services to cheap but low-quality offers. The growing interest in outsourcing providers from Eastern Europe causes the growth of proposal: each year more and more IT outsourcing companies appear in CEE countries. According to CEEOA’s yearly reviews of the IT outsourcing industry in the CEE region, the number of outsourcing services providers continued to increase during the last five years, as the chart below shows: We can see the proposal growing faster year by year. Such a variety makes it quite convenient to look for offshore contributors in the Eastern Europe. Project owners can look through lots of companies to find a most cost-effective variant. According to the reviews cited above, Ukraine is one of the major IT outsourcing services providers in the region. Outsourcing industry is flourishing within its borders. One of the biggest factors for that is the significant difference between price levels (which are among the lowest in Europe) and average software developers ' skill levels of (relatively high due to a strong technical education system) in the country. While more and more IT outsourcing companies appear following the worldwide industry boom, not all of them are likely to succeed. The more newcomers enter the market, the more severe the competition becomes. Finally, only those survive who can combine broad range of services with efficient methods of project management and highly professional approach to customers. That’s why a company’s age is among the most important criteria when searching a smart offshore (or nearshore) contributor to outsource your software development project to. Binary Studio, one of the leading Ukrainian IT outsourcing companies, has been an active player in this market since 2005, long before outsourcing IT projects to CEE region became as popular as it is now. Six years of constant growth and success helped us to gain a notable experience in various kinds of offshore IT outsourcing services. Binary aims at keeping its presence in most advanced and popular software development branches including: This market sector is one of our primary targets due its rapid growth during the last year.

Nowadays all the main platforms are standardized and contain lots of patterns. This allows software developers to avoid numerous routine actions such as creation of buttons, dialogue windows, authorization forms etc. As a result, more time is left for more creative complicated tasks. Today a big and ambitious software project requires a lot of well-organized programmers labor in order to meet all the functional set demands . And obviously it’s not enough to put together several software developers and provide them with a range of tasks. They are to be properly organized in order to avoid situations when a team member having some blocking issues slows down the whole team’s performance. Proper teamwork organizing is the best way to solve those difficulties. It includes the following elements: No planning means no organization. Still, methods of planning vary for different situations. In software development , tasks and priorities may change very often depending on sudden technical difficulties, customer requests, unexpected time losses etc. It is good to check from time to time whether the initial plan is relevant to a current situation. Plans should be flexible enough – of course, customer feedback is necessary for all important changes in work schedule. Team, autonomous as it is, could hold its training meetings – not only participating in general company events. This allows software developers adopt some special training activities which meet specific tasks of peculiar team the best. On the other hand, the knowledge exchange between different teams is good as well. It really unites the company staff! Team interaction is a key element of the development process as it helps to work out schedule, brainstorm the blocking issues, and avoid odd efforts. That is why modern IT companies encourage friendly and free communication between staff members. Methods of development process organization Many different software development outsourcing companies developed some organizational techniques. Gradually all that variety had undergone some classification. Today there are lots of books and articles about teambuilding methods in software development. Agile is one of the latest and most commonly adopted types. Agile became widely popular about a decade ago. Flexibility and user-centered approach – that’s what made it so effective. The development process becomes iterative, with each stage of the project closely analyzed. This helps to make corrections to the initial project plan without restarting the whole process. Therefore the team is receiving constant feedback which allows it to adjust to current situation (for example, in case the customer changes his mind). Scrum is most often considered as belonging to the Agile group of methods. Still it is usually referred to as a somewhat separate type. Scrum’s main peculiarities are constant process control and strict division of roles in the project. Main Scrum roles are Project Owner (a customer side representative which is thus made a team member), Scrum Master (similar to a team leader though with less supervising tasks) and Team Member (acting autonomously according to his own schedule mostly). Actually Scrum methodology is making a team of software developers even more decentralized which is helpful for achieving a higher level of ideas exchange. Our Experience Binary Studio has been successfully using Agile Scrum methods in many of its projects. We have made certain achievements in building an atmosphere of richer interaction and freer ideas exchange in our company. We are always open for discussions and knowledge exchange. You can follow our blog and get fresh information about our experience in Scrum and team building.

As the world IT outsourcing industry continues to grow faster and faster, regional markets are undergoing certain changes. The process of evolution gradually changes the face of the industry. Some software development outsourcing companies are entering this market while others are leaving the game. Several years ago we could observe Eastern Europe gaining strong positions in the software developer niche earlier monopolized by China and India. Today the nearshore outsourcing to the CEE region (Central and Eastern Europe) becomes more and more popular for IT companies from Germany, France, UK, USA and other hi-tech industry leaders. Difference in prices – this is what drives forward the outsourcing industry most of all. Corporations will seek foreign contributors for their projects as long as they suppose to cut overall costs by that. So, when searching among software development outsourcing companies in an offshore region, one will always check average salary levels in that place first. Earlier we have made some research in order to compare software developers’ fees in several countries. During the next 12 months many events occurred in the world software market, so a new statistical investigation would be helpful to better illustrate the potential of the CEE countries. A lot of surveys are required in order to define a precise median software developer salary in a country, but such a big research does not actually respond to our blog’s format. Still we can make certain evaluation of salary levels by examining some job-related websites which make their own researches. For example, PayScale provides fresh statistics on many countries, including median salaries in software development outsourcing companies. A comparative chart based upon this data is given below: The salary levels are sorted by price, and we can observe a significant difference between the ‘ demand zone ’ representatives (such as Germany) and the active players of the software development outsourcing market (such as Ukraine). Thus the CEE countries remain very attractive for companies which look for offshore contributors. As for Ukraine, local software development outsourcing companies have lowest prices in the region. Of course, the professional level of future contributors working for your project is important as well. During the last half a decade Ukrainian software development branch made a notable progress. Today it gradually becomes almost as influential as country’s traditional economies including metallurgy and machine building. Former industrial heart of USSR is now successfully moving towards hi-tech sector and its most promising part – software development. So the main advantages of outsourcing your web or custom application development project to Ukraine are as follows: Our company is always aiming to use all the advantages of our location. Binary Studio has never put itself inside a regional cluster but always remained open to customer proposals from any corner of the planet. We have successfully cooperated with clients from USA, UK, France, Finland, Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. Fluent English is our strict inner requirement because we consider constant and rich knowledge exchange with the customer side as a primary necessity for a software development outsourcing company.

The earliest software applications, which came into use after the first graphic interface systems had been introduced, were a big breakthrough for that time. Still, time runs much faster in the IT world, so several epochs have already passed since that time. Nowadays we have much higher standards for custom applications development – apart from a functional set, the following important qualities are most often required: No matter is it image capturing or business analytics, your application must deliver results at once. Nowadays users all over the world are very sensitive to any time lags, so you have to make sure they won’t find the application too slow. Well, the app you provided to your customer may be really awesome, but it cannot be the only thing he has installed on his machine. An average user usually has from 5 to 10 different apps running on his or her computer at once. If one of those apps is yours, you are responsible for it not taking too much memory or CPU. Multiple types and versions of operating systems are used now by people all over the globe. A challenging custom application provider must thus ensure that his products are compatible with most widespread OSs and platforms. Apart from rich functionality and good productivity, the outlook of an application is nonetheless important. People like nice things so good and convenient design may be even more crucial for a user than any other priorities of an application. Considering the growing importance of smart and up-to-date software solutions for users all over the world today, Binary Studio, a leading outsourcing software development company in Ukraine, is focusing its efforts on custom application development in order to make a contribution into this field. Our major services are: As we know, ultimate excellence is impossible to reach, so there always will be room for improvements.

The key peculiarity of the software development business is that it does not restrict itself to any certain location but can attract customers from any place of the world. That is why hundreds of software solutions producers are competing with each other, letting users to choose from a great variety of software products. In order to gain success in such a competitive market, a software producer must make some smart steps. Apart from finding some interesting idea for the product (some brand new feature or an innovative design), the main requirements for a successful product are: Of course, it is not a simple task to maximize all the criteria given above. It could be great to ensure better functionality and nicer design of your project, but it requires much time for a software developer to do that. And if you wish to make it faster, you need to hire a team – well, doesn’t look like the project cost would be low. Still, there is another great option – to find a developer team working remote. In our blog, we have already discussed the advantages of outsourcing software development projects. Let us once again overlook the main reasons for project owners to pass the work to offshore software development companies. They are, in brief: 1.    Lower fees Most outsourcing software development services providers come from regions with much lower prices where, nevertheless, strong technical professionals can be found – such as Eastern European countries. 2.    Faster performance A trained and experienced team of developers is very helpful for brainstorming difficulties and finding creative approach to complex tasks. 3.    No need to solve routine technical tasks While offshore developers are doing the technical part of the job, a project owner can concentrate on some strategic problems, such as doing marketing researches or building client networks. As every kind of business activity naturally includes some risk, certain problems can be encountered when outsourcing software development projects. To begin with, the remote team you have hired may turn out not productive enough. This usually occurs when the project is outsourced to a faraway location with big difference in time – this makes it much more difficult to contact with the developers team. As a result, the project will be rather low-cost, but the deadlines you specified are not met. Additionally, the project quality may be much lower in case the information exchange between the customer side and the team encounters some barriers (linguistic, for example). Such a situation often takes place when a project is outsourced to a location where prices are quite low but the good level of English is absent. Regarding these key issues of success, businesses from Western Europe and USA are now becoming more interested in finding nearshore contributors from regions with closer cultural and social peculiarities. For example, Eastern Europe obtained much better positions in the outsourcing software development market during the last several years and is now successfully competing with India and China, which earlier were undisputable leaders in this field. When it comes to a certain outsourcing services provider, it is essential to examine this company’s experience if possible. Actually this information must be present on the company’s website. If you can easily find all the information you need about the company you are going to contact, it means that your potential contributor is open and ready to share knowledge and ideas – a thing you’ll need very much during the work with your project.", "date": "2015-04-01"},

In 2011 IT sector continued its glorious march throughout the world markets. There were new achievements in the software development industry (including offshore software development), for example the usage of Android phones has grown overwhelmingly. So did the whole mobile apps development branch. But let us investigate the statistic information. Of course, we haven’t yet got enough data to discover the precise results for the last year. Still different researchers have already been made some rough estimates. For example, Gartner evaluates world’s total spending in IT sector in 2011 as about 3,664 billion USD which makes a 6,9% growth comparing to the 2010 results. It is worth noting that software market makes the biggest contribution into this progress boasting the highest growth rate among all other markets analyzed by Gartner – about 9,6%. Being perhaps the most innovative part of the world market, software development attracts lots of interest and is therefore a highly competitive field. That is why software projects are so often outsourced to offshore developer team which work remote for project owners. In case of a successful cooperation a project owner enjoys significant project cost reduction. But while the number of software outsourcing companies is boosting in less developed countries with relatively cheap labour, not each one of them can provide really high quality of project management and fast performance. So, it is quite a relevant question today - whether the offshore software development markets worldwide are ready to meet the ever-growing demand of qualified IT professional workforce? The advantages of offshore software development are quite well understood not only within the ‘ demand zone ’, but within the ‘ proposal zone ’ as well (including both its actual and potential members). The main reason is that entering this business sector requires much less efforts and expenditures if compared to other sectors. Especially this is true for countries with poorer economical conditions many of which are core members of the ‘proposal zone’. You don’t need to build a new factory here; you just have to find some good brains! Of course, some solid base is necessary in order to enter the world offshore software development market. Engineering skills, organizational capabilities and, last but not the least, the culture of informational sharing – these are the key values an offshore software development vendor must possess in order to ensure successful collaboration with customer side. As the competition goes rampant in the global software development market, quality and time are growing more and more important aside from a low overall project cost. The growing need for qualified collaborators and software development consulting companies was the reason why project owners from Western Europe and USA are now more interested in outsourcing their projects to Eastern European countries instead of South-East Asian region. Working remote is one of the strongest trends in modern world enabling offshore software development companies freer cooperate with their clients. It is evident that in the nearest future (regardless, if not inspired by, any financial crises) the rate of offshore projects in software development will grow even faster, with Eastern Europe quite possibly attracting much more attention from the ‘demand zone’.", "date": "2015-04-01"},

The matter is that it faces a challenging task – to ‘feed’ the never-saturated market. The demand for software solutions growing faster and faster – and no borders are visible yet. Daily life of an average big city denizen is pretty digitalized. In the morning he is awaken by alarm signal from his smartphone, then takes the device to check weather forecast for today using the special widget. By that time his laptop is ready, and he spends next 10-15 minutes checking his Gmail, Twitter, and Facebook accounts. After examining all the interesting updates and having a breakfast he takes a cup of tea and opens a couple of Photoshop files. During the next several hours he is busy improving the design of customer’s website. After the daily tasks are fixed, it is time for some socializing in forums and chats. What about living a whole life like that? This may seem a futuristic fiction but many people already live in this ‘fiction’, and such a lifestyle is quite likely to become mainstream in several years (a decade, maybe). Not that all of us will live in capsules and interact with the surrounding world via computer networks, but each person in the nearest future will have an option to buy a thing or to do the job remotely. So, more software applications will be needed. Speaking about future – what industry branch existing today will longer remain the same? Well, software development, for sure. At the moment we can see strong automation trends in all corners of society life, so handiwork will be significantly reduced in the nearest decade or so. But how will managers deal with automated systems? With the help of software applications, of course. That means that we’ll need special apps for all possible situations which include the work with technical systems. What is the most important in software development is that this huge sector of world economy possesses pure intellectual nature. What does one need to start a software development business? Why, get a new product concept, find some good brains and start working. Even an office isn’t a requirement – a project owner can hire a remote team. Such tasks are easily solved today with the help of software development outsourcing companies. Today outsourcing is a great option for project owners from USA and Western Europe willing to reduce their expenditures while keeping the good quality of their products. A leading Ukrainian outsourcing services provider, Binary Studio, believes in the crucial role of development industry in the society’s life. We see our mission in making contribution to the global process of building tools for faster and better knowledge sharing.

As a part of this methodology they have daily SCRUM-meetings with customers via Skype. It’s a very important part of product development and of course we don’t want to miss anything. So, we decided to record our meetings to be able to listen to them again in the future. The main goal of recording is to archive important information and decisions related to the project issues, and to improve language knowledge of team members. The requirements for the application that records Skype calls: We tried the most popular recorders but none of them satisfies all requirements. Wish to make something useful for our company 🙂 led me to the creation of my own application that will record Skype conversation and meets all points listed above. I spent few evenings and figured out one interesting thing about Skype: it is able to record sound without any additions! All you need is to send Skype API command that will redirect sound channels to the files! Of course, there are some limitations: So on the output we have two huge files (since WAV doesn’t have compression), which is inconvenient to store and listen. To create Skype recorder you should write some wrapper for Skype API and “class-handler” that will send and receive messages from Skype. It is also possible to use official Skype4COM library instead of implementing own wrapper, but it was interesting for me to do it myself. Here is the small tutorial how to use Skype API. First of all, we need to register “discover” and “attach” Windows API messages since Skype uses them for communication: Now, to attach to the Skype, you should send attachment request via Windows API broadcast message. As a parameter you must provide discover message ID skypeApiDiscover and window handle that will receive further messages from the Skype. Skype will show prompt for attachment request: After clicking one of the buttons Skype sends Window API message to the window which handle we have specified. The window must contain WndProc to be able to process message. As an attachment result Skype sends message with message == skypeApiAttach and lParam == 0 (in case of success; see other codes in the Skype API documentation). Parameter wParam contains Skype window handle that we will use to send commands. If attachment was done then WndProc will start receiving messages for all Skype events. To filter them we can check that message == WM_COPYDATA (0x004A) and wParam == skypeWindowHandle . The information about event is stored in the lParam (COPY_DATA structure). For example, the COPY_DATA content for the event of call beginning looks like: CALL 1234 STATUS INPROGRESS where 1234 – is the unique ID of the call. It must be used in the other Skype commands to have control over this conversation. For sending certain Skype command you should prepare COPY_DATA structure (include command text as content) and send it by using SendMessageTimeout Windows API function. For example, if we want to redirect current conversation sound to the file, we should use two Skype commands: The fragments of the code that send these commands: Note, that after redirection you will continue hearing your partner and microphone will work. Furthermore, different application can send redirection simultaneously and Skype will handle each separately. I figured out that in order to develop application that will automatically detect Skype presence and have an ability to reconnect, you need to invent some workarounds for the few Skype API issues: Skype saves sound “channels” separately in WAV format. To get MP3 file you need to : The easiest way is to use some external tool. For example, you can use such free open-source solutions like SoX (Sound eXchange, http://sox.sourceforge.net/ ) and LAME ( http://lame.sourceforge.net/ ). SkypeAutoRecorder. The result of my work is an open-source application SkypeAutoRecorder that is used now in the conference room and workplaces in our company. Application is developed using C# and Windows Presentation Foundation. It is always visible in the tray: The tray icon and its tooltip show the current application state (connected, waiting for calls, recording). The context menu provides access to the settings window: Following settings are available: File names can contain pattern placeholders for date-time of conversation start and contact name. Settings window verifies all inputs to exclude possible mistakes in the file names. All settings are stored per user in the Windows Roaming folder. The output format of the recorded files after processing is MP3 with variable bitrate and optionally increased sound volume. If application for some reason can’t distribute files to the specified location (for instance, network path or removable drive is inaccessible) then it will store it to the default Music folder of the current user and tell about this via message box. Developed application fully meets requirements listed above. The latest version and source code can be found on http://skypeautorecorder.codeplex.com/ .

But the most popular place to chill on 28 th of July was our new, cool office. As we have recently promised, Cherdak Club opened the doors for the most talented developers last Saturday. Flavoured coffee and amazing views of the whole city from our terrace that’s what the day started with. Next on agenda was Serhiy Kalinets’ talk about Fubu MVC, which impressed the audience a lot.  The discussion went on and on and we couldn’t help it, but continue during a sandwich break. The second and the most funny point in our “to do list” was Lean Lego Workshop by Dmytro Myndra and our .Net Team Lead – Denis. All attendees were divided into teams, who had to function as a united organism in order to deliver their customers the best products at high speed. The “product” as you’ve probably guessed, is a lego toy house which has specification, iterations and different engineers to work on it at each production phase. As the workshop lasted well into the lunch hour, we ate pizza, drank coke and had fun dancing to the music at our terrace. The last and the most mind blowing workshop we had to fight through was C# Coding Dojo. A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there to have fun and to engage in Deliberate Practice in order to improve their skills. The point is – first developer has to compose a test for some functionality, which actually doesn’t exist, the second engineer has to fix the current test by means of adding the functionality. When the test turns green i.e. is correct, the pair clasps their hands and gets a couple of chocolate candies. Next the second developer composes a text for imaginary functionality and so they do the same over and over again. But for ongoing brainstorming activity it was great fun! To top all the fun and make the day even better, Binary Studio gave presents to the random chosen attendees, who were happy to get nice Cherdak labeled T-shirts. The after party took place at the bar, where we had an opportunity to chat, have a bite, drink mojitos and enjoy the company. As it was the first time for our speakers in our city, we decided to show them so-called Donetsk Diamond, which is Donbass Arena. The stadium is amazing at night! After a long walk around the city centre, we said good-byes and went home a little bit upset though. It’s like you get the feeling when you’ve been waiting for some day for a long-long time and then it just passed by in a flash. However we are proud to say that everybody liked the event and was happy to spend a whole Saturday coding and improving skills. That’s what our prior aim was – let our developers gain some knew knowledge from experienced coaches and upgrade their skills while exercising at the workshop. And have fun, for sure. Here, at Binary Studio we do our best not only to hire the best developers but also to educate them. Perfection has no limits. Take a look at our photos !", "date": "2015-04-01"},

And no one got lost. The HR team is proud =) Our route went through Dortmund and Milan which made it possible to experience the best things of three countries in one trip. We flew to Dortmund and had a few hours to explore this small industrial German town. We wondered about, had famous German sausages with gluhwein, and of course tried German beer in a small pub right next to the Christmas fair. I have to say that we felt a bit nostalgic about last year’s trip to Munich but at the same time we were excitedly anticipating adventures in Amsterdam. The train took us to Amsterdam and at midnight having checked in, tired after long journey but excited we set off to explore Amsterdam. The first thing you notice there are the fairytale houses, canals and millions of bicycles. Red Lights street and overall aroma are also an inevitable part of the city and contribute to the atmosphere greatly. The second day started with free time, where everyone could choose what to do. Some went to the Van Gogh Museum to admire the techniques the painter used at different periods of his life and follow the evolution of his style. The others continued exploring the city, visited Christmas fairs and famous Dutch coffee shops. There was also some cool stuff in the Nemo Science center – a huge ship shaped museum we went to in the afternoon. A chess board with almost human sized figures, water clock, enormous soap bubbles and lots of other things to touch and move. In mid-December in Amsterdam there is a Light Festival, so many places and bridges are lit up, and different kinds of lamps are all over the city. It was a perfect time for a boat trip through the canals, which we took that evening. Day 3 also started with free time. Some went for shopping, some rented bicycles and went to a nice old park. Personally, I can’t express how cool it was to investigate the city on a bike, like a true citizen. It saves so much time and makes it possible to see the sights staying warm. What we all enjoyed in the afternoon was the Heineken Experience and Brewery . It not only guided us through the whole process of making beer, but brought us lots of fun: we sang and danced, relaxed and drank beer. The unusual thing about the Heineken Museum is that it is full of interactive experiences. A 5D movie, the possibility to make your own music video, become a DJ or certified draught master and even brand a bottle of beer (now we have a bottle of Binary Studio Heineken). In other words, Amsterdam was fun. The only problem we came across was the absence of quality food. That is why we were looking forward to the pastas, pizzas and lasagnas of Italy. Then followed 2 wonderful days In Milan. We saw the incredibly beautiful Duomo di Milano – white marble cathedral. Delicious Italian food and wine proved our expectations. It’s hard to be amazed by dessert, but the tiramisu at Osteria del Gambero Rosso literally sent me to heaven. You’ll find more pictures on our Facebook page .

Being junior is definitely exciting for me. Before I came to Academy I haven't kept an eye on web development for a long time. Looking back - finishing school I enjoyed web much, it was close to me, mostly because my dad is a seo-specialist. Those days I was a graduate kid also in Shag evening computer academy, created two or three simple web sites using plain HTML/CSS. Comparing to making some search optimization things (that I've learned from dad) it was good practice for me. Next, the most of university days were stuffed with lectures not connected with web-development, teaching C++, Java. Nevertheless fortunately enough during the last term we had subject, something like \"Web basics\" and my diploma project was PHP based. It was then I found out information about Binary Studio Academy. Dshh.. and now I'm almost six months here, really doesn't feel like that long, more like - \"in a blink of an eye\". So this jumping into development of web-applications, again, is like deja-vu for me, really nice to go back to the thing that excited you so much some time ago. Second, it's great to see web-development become that powerful comparing with the times I've first tried creating web-sites. That web was for me like - create some plain web-page, mostly containing some information, add some simple markup, that's all. Developers didn’t pay too much attention to dividing front-end and back-end, people who came to those resources acted like - visit and forget. There was no concrete focus on site those days. Now stack of using technologies increases day by day. I want to improve my PHP skills, try some new different PHP-frameworks, like Laravel, become more and more JavaScript-lover – want to dive into Backbone.js and some MV*-frameworks; try Node.js; use design patterns and more and more. There's also a lot of new development stuff I've never used before, so I turn myself into all of this. Referring to the topic of blogs for  PHP-developers, I found very interesting and helpful blogs like http://www.phptherightway.com , http://net.tutsplus.com , some entries from http://php.net , blogs of some developers like http://nikic.github.io , resource aggregate github pages like https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php , also try to find something interesting on github trending pages; then some frontend blogs like http://frontender.info , http://www.html5rocks.com , http://www.smashingmagazine.com/ , http://addyosmani.com/blog/ and so on; follow tutorials and screencasts. I also found some interesting books from Binary Studio library, now I’m reading “Learning JavaScript Design patterns”. I enjoy my current project, for 5 months I've worked very close with other remote German developer, and the customer, and then also with his wife, and sometimes I can even hear screams of their teen children over skype. I've started to work on this project not from zero, kind of rework. The customer gushes with the ideas, so I have a lot of interesting tasks. In the beginning I was mentored by a skilled expert, Sergey Golovin, who helped me a lot in hard questions. Finally, I enjoy working at Binary Studio 😉 I'm happy to have such a cute team of passionate professionals around and will do my best too.  For this time we had so much fun, so as they say, can't stop, won't stop.
